      <deck><![CDATA[The Amiga was a personal computer from Commodore that was released in a variety of different configurations.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">The first Amiga computer model, the A1000, was released in 1985 by <a href="/commodore/3010-2000/" data-ref-id="3010-2000">Commodore Inc.</a></p><p style="">The design team was headed up by Jay Miner and development of the system began in 1982 under the Amiga Corporation company. Commodore acquired Amiga Corporation in the summer of 1984, snatching the Amiga chipset from under the nose of <a href="/atari/3010-182/" data-ref-id="3010-182">Atari</a>, who originally funded the project. Commodore filed for bankruptcy in 1994, despite the success of the A1200 and CD32.</p><h2>Hardware</h2><p style="">The Amiga range was based on the Motorola 68000 chipset, but made use of proprietary graphics and sound co-processors (codenamed Denise and Paula respectively), which took the load off of the CPU and allowed the Amiga to process more than just gaming graphics extremely efficiently. The Amiga revolutionized video production, providing an affordable CG solution with the <a href="http://www.newtek.com" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">Newtek</a> Video Toaster (which later evolved into the Newtek TriCaster, the core of Giant Bomb's video production). It was the first consumer grade computer to be able to sample and record stereo audio in 44.1khz (CD quality) at the time. Over the lifetime of the computer, three graphics and sound chipsets were used: OCS (Original ChipSet), ECS (Enhanced ChipSet) and AGA (Advanced Graphics Architecture).</p><h2>Models</h2><table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Released</th><th scope="col">Model</th><th scope="col">Codename</th><th scope="col">Chipset</th><th scope="col">Memory</th><th scope="col">Kickstarter</th><th scope="col">Variants</th><th scope="col">Colours</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1985</td><td><strong>Amiga 1000</strong></td><td>Lorraine</td><td>OCS</td><td>256k onboard, upgradable to 512k</td><td>v1.0-v1.3, on floppy disc</td><td> </td><td><p style="">32 on screen,</p><p style="">4096 palette</p></td></tr><tr><td>1987</td><td><strong>Amiga 500</strong></td><td>Rock Lobster</td><td>OCS</td><td>512k onboard, upgradable to 1MB</td><td>v1.2 or v1.3, in ROM</td><td><p style=""><strong>A500+</strong> - ECS variant</p><p style=""><strong>A600</strong> - v2.05 variant <em>(codename "Junebug")</em></p><p style=""><strong>A600HD</strong> - includes hard drive</p><p style=""><strong>CDTV</strong> - Hi-fi case and CD-ROM A500+ variant</p></td><td><p style="">64 on screen,</p><p style="">4096 palette</p></td></tr><tr><td>1987</td><td><strong>Amiga 2000</strong></td><td>The Boss</td><td>OCS</td><td>1MB onboard, upgradable to 8MB</td><td>v1.3 or v2.0, in ROM</td><td><p style=""><strong>A1500</strong> - UK only, second floppy instead of hard drive</p><p style=""><strong>A2000C </strong>- ECS variant</p><p style=""><strong>A2500 </strong>- Pro variant with 68030 CPU "accelerator"</p></td><td><p style="">64 on screen,</p><p style="">4096 palette</p></td></tr><tr><td>1990</td><td><strong>Amiga 3000</strong></td><td>B2</td><td>ECS</td><td>2MB onboard, upgradable to 16MB</td><td>v1.3 or v2.0, in ROM</td><td><p style=""><strong>A3000UX</strong> - bundled with Unix</p><p style=""><strong>A3000T</strong> - tower variant</p></td><td><p style="">256 on screen,</p><p style="">4096 palette</p></td></tr><tr><td>1992</td><td><strong>Amiga 1200</strong></td><td>Channel Z</td><td>AGA</td><td>2MB onboard, upgradable to 8MB</td><td>v3.0, in ROM</td><td><strong>CD32</strong> - CD-ROM + no keyboard variant, not RAM upgradable <em>(codename "Spellbound")</em></td><td><p style="">4096 on screen,</p><p style="">262,144 palette</p></td></tr><tr><td>1993</td><td><strong>Amiga 4000</strong></td><td>Pandora</td><td>AGA</td><td>2MB onboard, upgradable to 16MB</td><td>v3.0, in ROM</td><td><strong>A4000T</strong> - Tower case, 68040 CPU</td><td><p style="">4096 on screen,</p><p style="">262,144 palette</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Operating System</h2><p style=""><b>AmigaOS </b></p><p style="">The AmigaOS originally was split into two parts, the <em>Kickstarter</em> and the <em>Workbench</em>.</p><p style="">The Amiga 1000 required a Kickstarter disc to boot before any other disc could be loaded. The benefits of this were easy OS upgrades (v1.0-1.3), however it also provided an easy vector for the first Amiga viruses to spread. The Amiga 500 onwards stored the Kickstarter (v1.2+) in ROM, thereby eliminating the need for an initial disc boot.</p><p style="">The Workbench was an optional windowing system and file manager, similar to Mac OS or Windows. Unlike those systems, games could launch at boot instead of the Workbench in order to give them larger access to system resources.</p>]]></description>

The Game Boy was released in <a href="/north-america/3035-1664/" data-ref-id="3035-1664">North America</a> in August, 1989, in <a href="/japan/3035-37/" data-ref-id="3035-37">Japan</a> on April 21, 1989, and in <a href="/europe/3035-289/" data-ref-id="3035-289">Europe</a> in September 1990. The Game Boy was the first in the Game Boy line, a line that lasted over fifteen years until the release of the <a href="/nintendo-ds/3045-52/" data-ref-id="3045-52">Nintendo DS</a>. It was created by the brilliant <a href="/gunpei-yokoi/3040-45151/" data-ref-id="3040-45151">Gunpei Yokoi</a>, as well as the same team that had developed Nintendo's <a href="/game-watch/3025-1183/" data-ref-id="3025-1183">Game &amp; Watch</a> series. The Game Boy pack-in game was <a href="/tetris/3030-1896/" data-ref-id="3030-1896">Tetris</a>, a little known puzzle game from <a href="/russia/3035-38/" data-ref-id="3035-38">Russia</a> that would help lead the Game Boy to its massive success. <a href="/minoru-arakawa/3040-19267/" data-ref-id="3040-19267">Minoru Arakawa</a> and several employees from Nintendo of America went to Russia to sign a deal to get the game on their system, they saw it as the equivalent to packing in <a href="/super-mario-bros/3030-15544/" data-ref-id="3030-15544">Super Mario Bros</a> with the <a href="/nes/3045-21/" data-ref-id="3045-21">NES</a>. Despite the Game Boy's handicap of being able to only display two colors, something that was technically inferior to what other handhelds was offering at the time it was massively more successful. Part of this was due to the fact that the batteries for Game Boy lasted a significantly longer times than those used for other full color handhelds, due to the fact that it used four AA batteries. 1998 saw Nintendo introduce the Game Boy's successor the <a href="/game-boy-color/3045-57/" data-ref-id="3045-57">Game Boy Color</a>; the two systems games were actually compatible with each other, with the entire Game Boy line up playable on the Game Boy Color and a select few Game Boy Color titles playable on the original Game Boy (although not in color). Backwards compatibility became a stable of Nintendo handhelds, Game Boy classic games were playable up until the release of the Nintendo DS.</p><p style="">In 1994 Nintendo released an adapter for the <a href="/snes/3045-9/" data-ref-id="3045-9">Super Nintendo</a> entitled the <a href="/super-game-boy-enhancement/3015-4804/" data-ref-id="3015-4804">Super Game Boy</a>, which allowed Super Nintendo players to play Game Boy games on their TV with a limited amount of colors. The adapter did not require the owner to own the original Game Boy system, just the adapter; despite this Game Boy remained as popular as ever. The first variation of the Game Boy, the Game Boy Pocket arrived in 1996. It was slimmer, more compact and the first in what would become a Nintendo tradition of releasing multiple variations of their handhelds. The Game Boy managed to sell its shipment of a million units within weeks in the <a href="/the-united-states-of-america/3035-396/" data-ref-id="3035-396">United States</a> and its initial shipment of 300,000 units in Japan in two weeks and reached 500,000 sales in Japan by July. The Game Boy and the color has sold 118.69 million combined worldwide and the Game Boy had sold 66.42 million alone before the release of the color. Twenty years after its introduction, in 2009 the Game Boy was inducted into the Nintendo toy hall of fame.</p><h2>Competition</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/130768/1859791-nintendoad29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1859791" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.3" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:130.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/130768/1859791-nintendoad29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1859791"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/130768/1859791-nintendoad29.jpg"></a><figcaption>An ad for the Atari Lynx that portrays the Gameboy as underpowered.</figcaption></figure><p style="">When it launched in 1989, the Game Boy entered a handheld battle against the <a href="/lynx/3045-7/" data-ref-id="3045-7">Atari Lynx</a> and <a href="/game-gear/3045-5/" data-ref-id="3045-5">Sega Game Gear</a>. Both the Lynx and Game Gear were technologically impressive for the time. They featured full color backlit screens and, in the case of the Lynx, significantly more processing power. Atari and Sega attempted to capitalize on their products' capabilites in advertisements that portrayed the Game Boy as weak and childish. A memorable Sega ad from the time proclaimed that "The Sega Game Gear separates the men from the boys". Despite their marketing efforts, the Lynx and Game Gear could not stop the Game Boy's dominance. Their weak battery life (a Game Gear or Lynx could deplete six AA batteries in 4-6 hours), combined with lackluster software libraries and higher prices, proved fatal. </p><h2>Hardware Revisions</h2><p style="">There was three different versions of the Game Boy that was released during its life. The Game Boy Light however was only released in Japan.</p><h3>Game Boy</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9566/392624-123950_gadget26_gameboy_b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-392624" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.99148936170213" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:99.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9566/392624-123950_gadget26_gameboy_b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-392624"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9566/392624-123950_gadget26_gameboy_b.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9566/392624-123950_gadget26_gameboy_b.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Game Boy Classic</figcaption></figure><p style="">The Game Boy was released on April 21, 1989 in Japan and then later in August for North America. The classic Game Boy ran on 4 AA batteries which powered the system for around 35 hours. Despite its size and less than perfect monochromatic screen the Game Boy lasted seven years until it received its first update. The Game Boy was only available in grey, in 1995 a "Play it Loud" line of the handheld was available in red, green, black, yellow, blue, white and transparent though this line had the exact same specifications. This set a trend of Nintendo handheld's being released in multiple colours. The link cable port is larger than the rest of the Game Boy line which makes it unable to link with all future models of the Game Boy.</p><p style="">RAM: 8 kB internal S-RAM</p><ul><li>Video RAM: 8 kB internal</li><li>ROM: 8 Mb cartridges</li><li>Sound: 2 Square Waves, 1 programmable 32-sample 4-bit PCM Wave, 1 White noise, and one audio input from the cartridge.</li><li>Display: Reflective LCD 160 x 144 pixels</li><li>Screen Size: 66 mm (2.6 in) diagonal</li><li>Power: 4 AA Batteries</li><li>Dimensions: 148 x 89 x 32 mm</li><li>Weight: 394g (with batteries)</li></ul><h3>Game Boy Pocket</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/1777455-gameboy_pocket.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1777455" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/1777455-gameboy_pocket.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1777455"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/112517/1777455-gameboy_pocket.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/112517/1777455-gameboy_pocket.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Game Boy Pocket</figcaption></figure><p style="">The Game Boy Pocket was originally released July 21, 1996 in Japan and then later released in North America in September 3, 1996. The Game Boy Pocket was smaller, lighter version of the original Game Boy designed to be able to easily fit in your pocket. An additional plus point of the system was that it only needed 2 AAA batteries, though this only powered the system for 10 hours. The Pocket featured a re-designed smaller link port, this version of the port was later used for all later models in the Game Boy line. Another improvement was an improved monochrome screen which did not blur up like on the original. The Game Boy Pocket like the original had no blacklight for darkened area and the first run did not feature a LED to indicate power levels, though due to public outcry a LED was added. The Pocket has been released in silver/chrome, red, yellow, green, black, transparent, pink and the original grey. Some limited editions of the handheld were also released.</p><ul><li>CPU: Custom 8-bit Sharp LR35902 core at 4.19 MHz</li><li>RAM: 8 kB internal S-RAM</li><li>Video RAM: 8 kB internal</li><li>ROM: 8 Mb cartridges</li><li>Sound: 2 Square Waves, 1 programmable 32-sample 4-bit PCM Wave, 1 White noise, and one audio input from the cartridge.</li><li>Display: Reflective LCD 160 x 144 pixels</li><li>Screen Size: 66 mm (2.6 in) diagonal</li><li>Power Supply: 2 AAA Batteries</li><li>Dimensions: 124 x 76 x 23 mm</li><li>Weight: 148g (with batteries)</li></ul><h3>Game Boy Light</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/1777456-gbl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1777456" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.99277456647399" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:99.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/1777456-gbl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1777456"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/112517/1777456-gbl.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/112517/1777456-gbl.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Game Boy Light</figcaption></figure><p style="">The Game Boy Light was a Japan exclusive variation of the handheld that was released on April 14, 1998, due to its Japan only release it is one of the rarest Game Boy models. The main selling point was it's indigo coloured backlight that allowed for play in dark environments. The Light ran on two AA batteries and lasted for 20 hours with the light off and 12 with it on. Amazingly none of the consoles that followed the Game Boy Light featured a back lit screen until the 2003 release of the <a href="/game-boy-advance/3045-4/" data-ref-id="3045-4">Game Boy Advance SP</a>. The Game Boy Light was only available in Gold and Silver though numerous special editions were released.

It had a D-pad, A and B buttons, and a Select and Start button. On the side of the Game Boy was a volume control, a contrast control, a link cable port, and a jack for rechargeable batteries (instead of just the regular batteries).

It is designed to work in conjunction with the Game Boy Camera, though some Game Boy and GBC games were also usable. It needs 6 AA batteries to run and uses special 3.8 cm Game Boy printer paper.</p><h3>Game Boy Camera</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/112517/1777605-gameboycamera.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1777605" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.77777777777778" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:77.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/112517/1777605-gameboycamera.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1777605"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/112517/1777605-gameboycamera.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/112517/1777605-gameboycamera.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Game Boy Camera</figcaption></figure><p style="">In 1998 Nintendo released the Game Boy camera, it was compatible with the Game Boy, Color, Pocket and Advance. The camera could only take black and white pictures and when used in conjunction with the game boy printer you could print your pictures out. The Game Boy camera was aimed at children who could not afford their own camera, the Camera also had some special features and mini-games to play. The Game Boy Camera was launched in five different colors blue, green, red, yellow and clear purple. There was also some limited editions released such as The Legend of Zelda and Pokemon editions.</p><h3>Super Game Boy</h3><p style="">Nintendo released the Super Game Boy accessory in 1994 for $60. The Super Game Boy allows Game Boy games to be played on your TV screen by using it with your Super Nintendo. It was also compatible with Game Boy Color cartridges, any original Game Boy cartridges you played with your Super Game Boy would still be in black and white, though some later games were programmed to show up in color and display a border around the game.</p>]]></description>

      <deck><![CDATA[Sega's first hand held video game system.  It was the portable version of the Master System.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style=""><a href="/sega/3010-62/" data-ref-id="3010-62"> Sega</a> Game Gear came out in the U.S. in 1991. Work originally began on the console in 1989 under the codename "Project Mercury", following Sega's policy at the time of codenaming their systems after planets. Like the <a href="/sega-master-system/3045-8/" data-ref-id="3045-8"> Sega Master System</a>, it was an <a href="/8-bit/3015-5951/" data-ref-id="3015-5951"> 8-bit</a> system. It was only the third commercially available color handheld console, after the <a href="/lynx/3045-7/" data-ref-id="3045-7"> Atari Lynx</a> and the TurboExpress. .It could run on 6-AA batteries or an AC adapter could be used to plug the GG into the wall or outlet. It came packaged with <em><a href="/columns/3030-5487/" data-ref-id="3030-5487"> <i>Columns</i></a></em> a "<a href="/tetris/3030-1896/" data-ref-id="3030-1896"> Tetris</a> type" game, in which you have to match the colored blocks as opposed to making lines.</p><p style="">The GG had many accessories. One of them was a TV tuner, which no longer works as of February 2000. Rechargable battery packs to help make the GG portable and not make you keep buying AA batteries every 2 hours, master gear converter to play Master System cartridges on the GG, a car adapter for playing in the car without batteries, and much more.</p><p style="">Originally only available in black, the GG was available in other colors. A Japan only release of an ultra-limited (10,000 units) white console in a special metal game case and TV Tuner was available soon after launch. Later a special blue sports themed version and a Coca-cola Red version were available in the US.</p><p style="">The Game Gear was built as a "landscape" hand-held. This meant that the D-pad and buttons were to the sides of the screen as opposed to being at the bottom like the <a href="/game-boy/3045-3/" data-ref-id="3045-3"> Game Boy</a>. This made the GG a lot more comfortable to hold because you hands were not so close and crammed together. The Game Gear ultimately played second fiddle to the Game Boy and despite being more popular in Europe it still became the first Sega product to be beaten in sales by a competing <a href="/nintendo/3010-90/" data-ref-id="3010-90"> Nintendo</a> product in the region.</p><h2>Launch</h2><h3>Japan - October 6, 1990</h3><ul><li><a href="/columns/3030-5487/" data-ref-id="3030-5487"> Columns</a></li><li><a href="/pengo/3030-4196/" data-ref-id="3030-4196"> Pengo</a></li><li><a href="/super-monaco-gp/3030-532/" data-ref-id="3030-532"> Super Monaco GP</a></li></ul><h3>North America - April 26, 1991</h3><ul><li><a href="/castle-of-illusion-starring-mickey-mouse/3030-9513/" data-ref-id="3030-9513"> Castle of Illusion starring Mickey Mouse</a></li><li><a href="/columns/3030-5487/" data-ref-id="3030-5487"> Columns</a></li><li><a href="/g-loc-air-battle/3030-13742/" data-ref-id="3030-13742"> G-Loc</a></li><li><a href="/psychic-world/3030-10932/" data-ref-id="3030-10932"> Psychic World</a></li><li><a href="/wonder-boy/3030-5220/" data-ref-id="3030-5220"> Revenge of Drancon</a></li><li><a href="/super-monaco-gp/3030-532/" data-ref-id="3030-532"> Super Monaco GP</a></li></ul>]]></description>

It was the successor of the 8-bit <a href="../../sega-master-system/60-8/" rel="nofollow">Sega Master System</a> and predecessor to the 32-bit <a href="../../saturn/60-42/" rel="nofollow">Sega Saturn</a>.</p><p style="">The console hardware had both a Motorola 86000 and a Zilog Z80 CPU which was commonly used in Sega <a href="/arcade/3045-84/" data-ref-id="3045-84">arcade </a> boards at the time--as well as arcade boards in general during the late 80s and early 90s. Sega's goal was to give home gamers a taste of arcade gameplay, made popular by their System-16 arcade boards, where hit games like <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/golden-axe/3030-14351/" data-ref-id="3030-14351">Golden Axe</a>, <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/altered-beast/3030-2536/" data-ref-id="3030-2536">Altered Beast</a>, and <a href="/alien-syndrome/3030-22009/" data-ref-id="3030-22009">Alien Syndrome </a>were frequently played in the arcades. An image from the video game Altered Beast was even used as the console box art, to help market it as a 16-bit arcade console. The console was not as powerful as their System-16 and future 16-bit arcade boards, however. The console could only display 64 colors out of 512, compared to 4096 possible colors from their 16-bit arcade boards. And the console could only display 80 sprites on screen, compared to the 128 sprites from their arcade boards.

The Sega Channel was a hardware add-on meant to be placed on top of the Genesis cartridge slot. The add-on allowed players to download games directly to their Sega Genesis consoles and play the games for a monthly fee. They did this by connecting a coaxial cable (the same kind used on cable boxes) to the back of the cartridge add-on. One could then choose to browse games from a variety of menus. Categories like shooter, role playing, platforming, etc. contained many popular Genesis titles people could download and play. After 30 days the games available would change. Usually, the most popular games were kept in service while the games people hardly played were replaced with other games. The Sega Channel also kept track of new games that were released. The games were usually available a month after their official release dates. Japanese import games were also available to subscribers. The activation fee was $29.95, and the monthly fee was $14.95. The service lasted until 1998, when the 32-bit era was established with the Sega Saturn, and the <a href="../../playstation/60-22/" rel="nofollow">Sony PlayStation</a>.

Released in October of 1995 at a price of $180 USD, the Nomad featured a 3.25 inch color screen and ran on six AA batteries.</p><p style="">Interestingly, the Nomad was a fully functional Genesis home console in addition to being a handheld device. Television connectivity was provided through an A/V slot on top of the unit. For single player games, the Nomad itself functioned as the controller, but two player gaming was possible using a controller port on the bottom of the device. This port accepted standard Genesis controllers.</p><p style="">The Nomad suffered from problems that plagued Sega's other handheld, the 8-bit <a href="/game-gear/3045-5/" data-ref-id="3045-5">Game Gear</a>. Both machines were notoriously power-hungry thanks to their (relatively) powerful processors and high quality backlit LCD screens. The Nomad was capable of depleting its batteries in two hours, which lessened its appeal as a portable device. Additionally, despite being advertised as a wholly-capable Genesis console, the Nomad was functionally incompatible with the various Genesis add-ons Sega had released such as the <a href="/sega-cd/3045-29/" data-ref-id="3045-29">Sega CD</a> and <a href="/sega-32x/3045-31/" data-ref-id="3045-31">32X</a>. These compatibility problems were due to the shape of the Nomad, and the inability to mount these accessories on its portable form factor.</p><p style="">Faced with competition from Nintendo's hugely successful Game Boy, the Nomad faltered at market.

Model 2 had both compression and a filter added to mask the distortion caused by lowering the original sample rate. Unfortunately, this didn't work.

      <description><![CDATA[<h2><b>Overview</b></h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The Atari Lynx was released in 1989 by <a href="/atari-sa/3010-548/" data-ref-id="3010-548">Atari Corporation, </a>based upon an <a href="/epyx-inc/3010-901/" data-ref-id="3010-901">Epyx</a> design. The design was completed two years earlier, but Epyx did not have the capital to produce the system themselves. Atari had considered entering the portable market in 1981 with of a portable console called the Atari 2200; a smaller version of the <a href="/atari-2600/3045-40/" data-ref-id="3045-40">Atari 2600</a>, with an internal screen. This never came to fruition as it was not deemed cost-effective.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The Lynx was highly advanced for the time, and was the first handheld console with a fully backlit screen and 16-bit technology. Further, a Lynx is ambidextrous with a simple flip. In 1991, Atari released the updated Lynx II. Slightly smaller than the original and with improved aesthetics, it is still quite large and bulky compared to other contemporary consoles. Over 100 games were released for the system over its life span, and it had an estimated 500,000 user install base worldwide.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Criticisms of the console are generally regarding the relatively large size, short battery life, and lack of third-party support. The <a href="/nintendo/3010-90/" data-ref-id="3010-90">Nintendo</a> <a href="/game-boy/3045-3/" data-ref-id="3045-3">Game Boy</a> and the <a href="/sega/3010-62/" data-ref-id="3010-62">Sega</a> <a href="/game-gear/3045-5/" data-ref-id="3045-5">Game Gear</a> both dominated the market into the early nineties, though the Lynx continued to do well, particularly in Europe. By 1996, Atari ceased production of the system.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Today the Atari Lynx still has a dedicated cult following, with some developers and private individuals still making and producing games for the platform. In 2008 the system, and Atari were honored by the 59th annual technology and engineering Emmy awards, for pioneering the handheld gaming platform.</p><h2>Hardware</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">CPU - Dual 16-bit CMOS, Mikey &amp; Suzy (16MHZ)</p><figure style="width: 480px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3104/417046-atari_lynx_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-417046" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3104/417046-atari_lynx_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-417046"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3104/417046-atari_lynx_1.jpg"></a><figcaption>Atari Lynx console</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">RAM - 64KB DRAM.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">On Screen Colors - 4096 (16 simultaneous per scan line).</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Screen Resolution - 160x102 Pixels.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Screen - LCD 82.55mm x 47.75mm and (88.9mm/3.5" diagonal).</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Sound - 8-bit 4 channel (mono for Lynx I and Stereo sound for Lynx II).</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Game Cartridge - 2MB (16Mbit).</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Power Supply - AC adapter or batteries.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Battery Life - 4 hours for the Lynx I and 5 hours for Lynx II (6 AA batteries Alkaline).</p><h3>Launch titles in North America</h3><ul><li><a href="/blue-lightning/3030-3142/" data-ref-id="3030-3142">Blue Lightning</a></li><li><a href="/california-games/3030-3193/" data-ref-id="3030-3193">California Games</a></li><li><a href="/electrocop/3030-11150/" data-ref-id="3030-11150">Electrocop</a></li><li><a href="/gates-of-zendocon/3030-6909/" data-ref-id="3030-6909">Gates of Zendocon</a></li></ul>]]></description>

It is based off the Mark III release of Sega's first entry into the Japanese console market, the <a href="/sega-sg-1000/3045-141/" data-ref-id="3045-141">SG-1000</a>. It competed directly alongside the <a href="/nintendo/3010-90/" data-ref-id="3010-90">Nintendo</a> <a href="/nes/3045-21/" data-ref-id="3045-21">Entertainment System</a> during its heyday, and it was supported by Sega well into the 1990's. The console usually featured a built-in game, such as <a href="/hang-on/3030-11570/" data-ref-id="3030-11570">Hang-On</a>, <a href="/space-harrier/3030-6036/" data-ref-id="3030-6036">Space Harrier</a>, a timed <a href="/snail-maze/3030-21555/" data-ref-id="3030-21555">maze game</a> featuring a snail, <a href="/alex-kidd-in-miracle-world/3030-9101/" data-ref-id="3030-9101">Alex Kidd in Miracle World</a>, <a href="/sonic-the-hedgehog/3030-2465/" data-ref-id="3030-2465">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>, or <a href="/sonic-the-hedgehog-2/3030-1662/" data-ref-id="3030-1662">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a>.</p><p style="">The system has 2 9-pin controller ports, with each controller having 2 buttons (labeled 1 and 2) and an 8-way directional pad, created largely due to Nintendo's copyright of their cross bar pad, which caused the SMS controller to have more pronounced diagonals than their competition, but smaller N, S, E, and W controls. The pause button is located directly on the console.</p><p style="">While the Master System didn't challenge Nintendo much in the <a href="/the-united-states-of-america/3035-396/" data-ref-id="3035-396">US </a>and Japan, it was a major success in Europe and South America, outselling the NES in those territories. This gave Sega a good foothold in the home console market, which they capitalized on with their more successful follow up, the <a href="/genesis/3045-6/" data-ref-id="3045-6">Sega Genesis</a>. The Master System was still selling in Europe into the late 1990s, and is still selling through to the present day in <a href="/brazil/3035-720/" data-ref-id="3035-720">Brazil</a>, where it remains the best-selling console to this day. The Master System sold <a href="http://gaming.wikia.com/wiki/Third-Generation_Consoles" rel="nofollow">16.39 million</a> units worldwide, including 1.72 million in Japan, 2 million in the <a href="/the-united-states-of-america/3035-396/" data-ref-id="3035-396">United States</a>, 5 million in <a href="/brazil/3035-720/" data-ref-id="3035-720">Brazil</a>, 6.95 million in Western Europe, and 720,000 in <a href="/south-korea/3035-2410/" data-ref-id="3035-2410">South Korea</a>.</p><p style="">The Master System's software library was limited in North America and Japan due to Nintendo's restrictive third-party licensing policies, for which the console has been criticized by the North American press. However, the system's reception was far more positive in Europe and South America, regions where Nintendo's restrictive third-party licensing policies did not apply. As a result, the Master System's software library in Europe and South America was significantly larger and more diverse, whereas it was the NES which had a more limited software library in those regions.</p><h2>Launch</h2><h3>Japan - October 20, 1985</h3><ul><li><a href="/hang-on/3030-11570/" data-ref-id="3030-11570">Hang-On</a></li><li>Teddy Boy Blues</li></ul><h3>North America - June 1986</h3><ul><li><a href="/hang-on/3030-11570/" data-ref-id="3030-11570">Hang-On</a></li><li><a href="/safari-hunt/3030-13798/" data-ref-id="3030-13798">Safari Hunt</a></li></ul><h3>Europe - Fall 1986</h3><ul><li><a href="/action-fighter/3030-11058/" data-ref-id="3030-11058">Action Fighter</a></li><li><a href="/black-belt/3030-16176/" data-ref-id="3030-16176">Black Belt</a></li><li><a href="/choplifter/3030-18152/" data-ref-id="3030-18152">Choplifter</a></li><li><a href="/fantasy-zone/3030-9493/" data-ref-id="3030-9493">Fantasy Zone</a></li><li><a href="/hang-on/3030-11570/" data-ref-id="3030-11570">Hang-On</a></li><li><a href="/transbot/3030-15686/" data-ref-id="3030-15686">Transbot</a></li><li><a href="/world-grand-prix/3030-20203/" data-ref-id="3030-20203">World Grand Prix</a></li></ul><h2>Peripherals</h2><p style=""><em>Further information: <a href="/segascope-3-d-glasses/3000-76/" data-ref-id="3000-76">SegaScope 3-D Glasses</a> and <a href="/power-base-converter/3000-23/" data-ref-id="3000-23">Power Base Converter</a></em></p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/500/435061-ms_3_d_glasses.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-435061" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/500/435061-ms_3_d_glasses.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-435061"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/500/435061-ms_3_d_glasses.jpg"></a><figcaption>The 3D glasses.</figcaption></figure><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/91/1075409-800px_sega_master_system_lightphaser.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1075409" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.73" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:73.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/91/1075409-800px_sega_master_system_lightphaser.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1075409"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/91/1075409-800px_sega_master_system_lightphaser.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/91/1075409-800px_sega_master_system_lightphaser.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Light Phaser.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Early models of the console shipped with a <a href="/safari-hunt/3030-13798/" data-ref-id="3030-13798">Safari Hunt</a>/ <a href="/hang-on/3030-11570/" data-ref-id="3030-11570">Hang On</a> card, one game pad and one light phaser. <a href="/missile-defense-3-d/3030-19870/" data-ref-id="3030-19870">Missile Defense 3D</a> also made use of the console's <a href="/segascope-3-d-glasses/3000-76/" data-ref-id="3000-76">SegaScope</a> <a href="/3-d-glasses/3055-1919/" data-ref-id="3055-1919">3D glasses</a>, which plugged into a card slot device and saw only six games made for it since release.

For the model 1 Sega Master System, the machine pre-programmed with three games. The actual retail quality games were <a href="/hang-on/3030-11570/" data-ref-id="3030-11570">Hang On</a> (Action) and <a href="/safari-hunt/3030-13798/" data-ref-id="3030-13798">Safari Hunt</a> (Light Phaser Series). However, there is a special exclusively programmed meta-mini-game hidden in the Master System hardware.

The machine allowed for cartridges in the Mega-Cartridge series. For example, the game <a href="/alex-kidd-in-miracle-world/3030-9101/" data-ref-id="3030-9101">Alex Kidd in Miracle World</a> was a Mega-Cartridge game, but later and more advanced games like <a href="/after-burner/3030-3629/" data-ref-id="3030-3629">After Burner</a> used the Four Mega-Cartridge technology. It is unknown at this point if the Sega Master System cartridge technology surpassed the Four-Mega Cartridge. However, there is another variation on this form of software; the implementation of a lithium battery (exactly the same as batteries used for computer motherboards). This addition is indicated with the cartridge suffix descriptor of "Plus" or plus battery aided rewritable memory storage. For example, <a href="/phantasy-star/3030-7400/" data-ref-id="3030-7400">Phantasy Star</a> is classified as a Four-Mega Plus Cartridge. The Plus feature allowed for players to record scores and game progress.</p><p style="">Another form of game media for the Sega Master System also had support for game card or "Sega Cards." These were credit card sized solid state form of media that were fed into their own dedicated input slot on the system and tended to be ports of games from Sega's older Japanese console titles. The appeal of this software format was that they held less (only 34KB of space), game cards ended up being cheaper than Sega's Mega Cartridge games. One of the best titles on the Sega Card media is <a href="/transbot/3030-15686/" data-ref-id="3030-15686">Transbot</a>. It is important to note that the two later model designs of the Sega Master system omit a game card input slot.</p><p style=""> </p>]]></description>

The machine debuted in Japan on November 21, 1990, and arrived in North America, South America, Europe, and Australia during September of 1991.</p><p style="">The SNES was a 16-bit console and a direct competitor to <a href="/sega/3010-62/" data-ref-id="3010-62">Sega</a>'s Genesis. As with the NES, the SNES was the most successful console of its generation in terms of sales. The console triumphed through the support of both Nintendo and third-party developers. The console saw releases from high profile developers such as <a href="/capcom/3010-367/" data-ref-id="3010-367">Capcom</a>, <a href="/squaresoft/3010-6323/" data-ref-id="3010-6323">Squaresoft</a>, and <a href="/konami-corporation/3010-87/" data-ref-id="3010-87">Konami</a>. The SNES era is looked back on by many as "the golden era of video games."</p><p style="">Nintendo introduced an arcade system called the <a href="/nintendo-super-system/3015-3204/" data-ref-id="3015-3204">Nintendo Super System</a> in the early nineties that could be used to preview upcoming Super Nintendo games. Games that appeared on it included <a href="/super-mario-world/3030-1334/" data-ref-id="3030-1334">Super Mario World</a>, <a href="/actraiser/3030-7274/" data-ref-id="3030-7274">ActRaiser</a>, <a href="/contra-iii-the-alien-wars/3030-3016/" data-ref-id="3030-3016">Contra III: The Alien Wars</a>, and <a href="/f-zero/3030-15242/" data-ref-id="3030-15242">F-Zero</a>.</p><h3>Rivalry with Sega</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/873617-large.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-873617" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.65" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:65.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/873617-large.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-873617"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/873617-large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Genesis does what Nintendon't.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Nintendo and <a href="/sega/3010-62/" data-ref-id="3010-62">Sega</a> maintained a fierce rivalry during the 16-bit era. Sega's Genesis was released before the SNES, and this head start allowed the Genesis to gain a substantial sales lead by the time the SNES came to market. Simultaneously, Sega ran an aggressive marketing campaign that portrayed the SNES and its players as slow and childlike when compared to the speedy and "cool" Genesis. One of the most notorious of these ads touted the Genesis' (non-existant) "<a href="/blast-processing/3015-963/" data-ref-id="3015-963">Blast Processing</a>," which ostensibly allowed the Genesis to better render high-speed games such as <a href="/sonic-the-hedgehog/3030-2465/" data-ref-id="3030-2465">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> . While the Genesis led the SNES in sales throughout most of the 16-bit generation, the SNES eventually overtook it as the generation ended.</p><h2>History</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/813478-snes_logo.png" data-ref-id="1300-813478" data-size="small" data-ratio="1" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/813478-snes_logo.png" data-ref-id="1300-813478"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/813478-snes_logo.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/813478-snes_logo.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Super Famicom logo in Japan and PAL regions</figcaption></figure><p style=""><a href="/nec-technologies-inc/3010-1741/" data-ref-id="3010-1741">NEC</a> released the <a href="/turbografx-16/3045-55/" data-ref-id="3045-55">TurboGrafx-16</a> in 1987 to compete with the incredibly popular NES. <a href="/sega/3010-62/" data-ref-id="3010-62">Sega</a> released its <a href="/genesis/3045-6/" data-ref-id="3045-6">Genesis</a> the next year. Both of these consoles were based on 16-bit hardware, and were large improvements in sound and graphics over the 8-bit based NES. As Nintendo's dominance in the market began slipping, Nintendo executives began to design a new system (albeit reluctantly at first) as early as 1988.</p><p style="">The SNES was designed by <a href="/masayuki-uemura/3040-69066/" data-ref-id="3040-69066">Masayuki Uemura</a>, who also designed the original Famicom. The Super Famicom was originally released in Japan on November 21, 1990 for ¥25,000, or about $210. It was a huge hit, with the initial units shipped selling very quickly. With the Super Famicom being such a success, Nintendo dominated over their rivals. This was partially due to the support of third-party developers, such as <a href="/capcom/3010-367/" data-ref-id="3010-367">Capcom</a>, <a href="/konami-corporation/3010-87/" data-ref-id="3010-87">Konami</a>, <a href="/square-co-ltd/3010-6323/" data-ref-id="3010-6323">Square</a>, <a href="/enix-corporation/3010-6337/" data-ref-id="3010-6337">Enix</a>, and <a href="/tecmo-inc/3010-485/" data-ref-id="3010-485">Tecmo</a>.</p><p style="">The Super Nintendo Entertainment System was released in North America in September 1991. It was a mildly redesigned version of the Super Famicom that originally sold for $199. One of the main selling points for the console was the fact that it was packaged with Super Mario World. Originally, very few titles were shipped upon release, such as <a href="/pilotwings/3030-14727/" data-ref-id="3030-14727">Pilotwings</a>, <a href="/f-zero/3030-15242/" data-ref-id="3030-15242">F-Zero</a>, <a href="/simcity/3030-15035/" data-ref-id="3030-15035">SimCity</a>, and <a href="/gradius-iii/3030-7617/" data-ref-id="3030-7617">Gradius III</a>, but these titles were all very well-received and showcased the SNES's Mode 7 abilities.</p><h3>Policies</h3><p style="">Nintendo's policies during the NES era were infamous: Nintendo had to approve every game, third-party developers could release only five games per year (and these games couldn't be released on a rival console within two years), and Nintendo controlled the manufacturing and supply of NES cartridges. When Sega began competing with Nintendo, however, these practices ended. Acclaim was the first developer to release their games for both consoles, and many other developers followed suit.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/873638-1112203563_04.png" data-ref-id="1300-873638" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.87109375" data-width="256" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 256px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:87.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/873638-1112203563_04.png" data-ref-id="1300-873638"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/873638-1112203563_04.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/873638-1112203563_04.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>The censored SNES version.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Nintendo, however, maintained their strict censorship policy. This was one of the key reasons why the Genesis version of <a href="/mortal-kombat/3030-15743/" data-ref-id="3030-15743">Mortal Kombat</a> sold much better than the SNES version. Nintendo removed all of the gore from the game, including fatalities, while the Genesis version kept these things.</p><p style="">Mortal Kombat's gore also sparked US Senators Herb Kohl and Joe Lieberman to call a Congressional hearing to discuss the effect of violent games on children. This meeting caused the founding of the Interactive Digital Software Association (now known as the Entertainment Software Association) and the <a href="/entertainment-software-ratings-board/3010-6476/" data-ref-id="3010-6476">Entertainment Software Rating Board</a> (which applies ratings to all games). Because of these companies being founded, Nintendo decided their censorship policies were no longer needed, and <a href="/mortal-kombat-ii/3030-3571/" data-ref-id="3030-3571">Mortal Kombat 2</a> was released in an uncensored version on the SNES, which caused it to sell better than the Genesis version.</p><h2>Technical Specifications</h2><ul><li><b>CPU</b>: Custom 65c816 based Ricoh 5A22 running at a selectable 3.58 MHz, 2.66 Mhz or 1.77 Mhz.</li><li><b>Memory</b>: 128 Kb main RAM, 64 Kb video RAM, 64 Kb audio RAM</li><li><b>Video</b>: 256 x 224 or 512 x 224 or 256 x 239 or 512 x 239 progressive resolutions, 512 x 448 or 512 x 478 interlaced resolutions, 32,768 colors (256 colors max on screen)</li><li><b>Audio</b>: 2 Sony audio processors (1 8-bit, and 1 16-bit DSP) 8 channels, Sample Rate 32KHz, 16-bit stereo output</li><li>The SNES can also take advantage of custom chips provided by the individual game cartridges, like the "Super FX" co-processor chip that ran at either 10.5Mhz or 21Mhz depending on the game.

While purple and blue were used on the North American SNES, the Super Famicom as well as the European and Australian SNES had a logo consisting of rounded green, blue, yellow, and red shapes matching the Super Famicom's and PAL SNES' colored A, B, X, and Y buttons. Additionally, each version of the console has its own version of region lockout, with differently shaped cartridges, rendering a Japanese or PAL version of a game useless on a North American console and vice versa.</p><h3>Hardware Revision</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/245/232259-img_0078.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-232259" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.63092979127135" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:63.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/245/232259-img_0078.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-232259"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/245/232259-img_0078.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/245/232259-img_0078.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The SNS-101</figcaption></figure><p style="">On October 20, 1997 the Super Nintendo received lighter and more streamlined design in the US.

It was famous for allowing SNES games to display pseudo-3D graphics, giving the illusion of depth. The mode was able to warp the background layer of a game, changing the perspective to make the background appear to be moving. This was used prominently in a variety of games, to various effects. <a href="/final-fantasy-iv/3030-20829/" data-ref-id="3030-20829">Final Fantasy IV</a> and <a href="/final-fantasy-vi/3030-6336/" data-ref-id="3030-6336">Final Fantasy VI</a> used it to give the overworld an illusion of movement and size; when the player goes into an airship, the ground below shrinks away as the player gets higher and higher.</p><p style="">One limitation of Mode 7 was that it only allowed the background layer to be scaled and rotated. Individual sprites could not have this effect applied to them. So games like <a href="/super-castlevania-iv/3030-11443/" data-ref-id="3030-11443">Super Castlevania IV</a> and <a href="/super-metroid/3030-8292/" data-ref-id="3030-8292">Super Metroid</a>, where characters appear to have that effect applied to them are actually part of the background layer. In <a href="/contra-iii-the-alien-wars/3030-3016/" data-ref-id="3030-3016">Contra III: The Alien Wars</a>, where massive bosses appear to rotate and twist, they actually are the "background," and the background is actually a sprite that changes with the player's movement.</p><h3>Enhancement Chips</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8572/477089-star_fox__v1.2___u_____002.png" data-ref-id="1300-477089" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.875" data-width="256" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 256px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:87.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8572/477089-star_fox__v1.2___u_____002.png" data-ref-id="1300-477089"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8572/477089-star_fox__v1.2___u_____002.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8572/477089-star_fox__v1.2___u_____002.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Star Fox's 3D graphics are powered by the Super FX chip.</figcaption></figure><p style="">There were a variety of first and third party enhancement chips included in SNES games. The most famous of these chips is the Super FX chip, used in games such as <a href="/star-fox/3030-3984/" data-ref-id="3030-3984">Star Fox</a> and <a href="/stunt-race-fx/3030-19991/" data-ref-id="3030-19991">Stunt Race FX</a>. However, there are numerous other notable chips, including the GB-Z80, DSP, CX4, S-RTC. The Super FX chip actually works to accelerate the graphics, making the SNES capable of more detailed, and even 3D, graphics. Its effects are seen in many games, including <a href="/doom/3030-7326/" data-ref-id="3030-7326">Doom</a> and <a href="/super-mario-world-2-yoshis-island/3030-2866/" data-ref-id="3030-2866">Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island</a>.</p><p style="">The GB-Z80 chip was used in the <a href="/super-game-boy-enhancement/3015-4804/" data-ref-id="3015-4804">Super Game Boy</a>, and it enabled the SNES to emulate <a href="/game-boy/3045-3/" data-ref-id="3045-3">Game Boy</a> hardware effectively. The SNES's processor was not powerful enough on its own. The DSP chip, of which there are several varieties, increases the capabilities of the SNES's Mode 7. The CX4 was a math processor used by <a href="/capcom/3010-367/" data-ref-id="3010-367">Capcom</a> in <a href="/mega-man-x2/3030-19801/" data-ref-id="3030-19801">Mega Man X2</a> and <a href="/mega-man-x3/3030-16948/" data-ref-id="3030-16948">Mega Man X3</a>, aiding in the formation of trigonometric graphics. The S-RTC was used in one game (Dai Kaiju Monogatari 2) to power a real-time in-game clock.</p><h2>Launch Titles</h2><h3>Japanese Launch Titles (November 21, 1990)</h3><ul><li><a href="/super-mario-world/3030-1334/" data-ref-id="3030-1334">Super Mario World</a></li><li><a href="/f-zero/3030-15242/" data-ref-id="3030-15242">F-Zero</a></li></ul><h3>U.S. Launch Titles (August 23, 1991)</h3><ul><li><a href="/super-mario-world/3030-1334/" data-ref-id="3030-1334">Super Mario World</a></li><li><a href="/f-zero/3030-15242/" data-ref-id="3030-15242">F-Zero</a></li><li><a href="/pilotwings/3030-14727/" data-ref-id="3030-14727">Pilotwings</a></li></ul><h3>European Launch Titles (April 11, 1992)</h3><ul><li><a href="/super-soccer/3030-11864/" data-ref-id="3030-11864">Super Soccer</a></li><li><a href="/super-tennis/3030-18664/" data-ref-id="3030-18664">Super Tennis</a></li><li><a href="/super-r-type/3030-8479/" data-ref-id="3030-8479">Super R-Type</a></li><li><a href="/f-zero/3030-15242/" data-ref-id="3030-15242">F-Zero</a></li></ul><h2>Planned CD Add-On and Other Peripherals</h2><p style="">Nintendo eventually planned to partner with Sony to develop a CD-based add-on for the console.

After various disagreements between the two companies, the partnership was dissolved and Nintendo looked to Phillips to produce a similar CD-based add-on for the popular 16-bit console.</p><p style="">The partnership between Nintendo and Phillips wouldn't result in the release of a SNES CD drive, but the deal eventually resulted in Nintendo's characters appearing in a small number of Phillips-produced titles for its own multimedia console, the CD-i.

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>CPC 464</h2><p style="">The <a href="/amstrad/3010-3924/" data-ref-id="3010-3924">Amstrad</a> CPC 464 was the first of the CPC series released on the 21st June 1984. it quickly became one of the most successful home computers in Europe. More than two million CPC 464s were sold in total between 1984 and 1990.</p><p style="">Despite its lack of stand-out features from competitors such as <a href="/commodore/3010-2000/" data-ref-id="3010-2000">Commodore</a> and <a href="/sinclair-research-ltd/3010-938/" data-ref-id="3010-938">Sinclair</a>, it gained popularity from its low price and the fact that the computers were sold as a complete unit, comprising of CPU/keyboard, built-in tape recorder and monitor (optional monochrome green or colour). Competitor computers such as the <a href="/zx-spectrum/3045-16/" data-ref-id="3045-16">ZX Spectrum</a> came only with the CPU/keyboard, requiring a separate monitor.</p><h2>CPC 472</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1270/815411-800px_cpc_472_es.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-815411" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.3075" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:30.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1270/815411-800px_cpc_472_es.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-815411"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1270/815411-800px_cpc_472_es.jpg"></a><figcaption>CPC 472</figcaption></figure><p style="">The CPC 472 was a Spanish version of the CPC 464 with an additional, non-functional 8KB RAM. A Spanish law required that every computer with up to 64KB should have extra keys for the Spanish language, or an extra tax would be levied. So Amstrad soldered in an extra 8KB which was not, however, usable by the machine since it was not connected to anything else. Later on Amstrad released a 472 with a proper Spanish keyboard. After the rule changed there was also a CPC 472 with non-Spanish keys available for a very short time. Today, the CPC 472 is very rare.</p><h2>CPC 664</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1270/815412-cpc664.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-815412" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.67428571428571" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:67.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1270/815412-cpc664.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-815412"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1270/815412-cpc664.jpg"></a><figcaption>CPC 664</figcaption></figure><p style="">Released in In June 1985, the CPC 664 is essentialy the same hardware as the previous CPC 464 with a floppy disc drive taking the place of the cassette drive and a new easier to type keyboard.</p><h2>CPC 6128</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1270/815415-cpc6128.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-815415" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.7" data-width="210" style="width: 210px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:70.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1270/815415-cpc6128.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-815415"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1270/815415-cpc6128.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1270/815415-cpc6128.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>CPC 6128</figcaption></figure><p style="">Amstrad launched the CPC 6128 shortly after the CPC 664 for the American market . The new machine had 128KB of memory and a sleeker appearance, but was otherwise identical to the 664.</p><p style="">The machine was launched in <a href="/europe/3035-289/" data-ref-id="3035-289">Europe</a> shortly afterwards, replacing the 664 for the same price.</p><h2>The Plus Series</h2><p style="">The last models in the Amstrad CPC range were the Amstrad 464 Plus, Amstrad 6128 Plus, and the short lived Amstrad GX4000, a standalone console aimed squarely at the burgeoning home console market.</p><p style="">All launched together in 1990. The CPC name is said to have been dropped because of a legal dispute with a French firm, though it is also likely that "CPC 6128 Plus" was considered too unwieldy a name and one redolent of the machine's mid-80s heritage.</p><p style="">Described as a solution of <em>"too little, too late"</em>, this was Amstrad's second effort to prolong the life of its 8-bit computer series in the face of fierce competition from new 16-bit machines (notably, the <a href="/atari-st/3045-13/" data-ref-id="3045-13">Atari ST</a> and the <a href="/amiga/3045-1/" data-ref-id="3045-1">Commodore Amiga</a>). The Plus series were mostly (but not quite 100%) compatible with the original CPC computers, and incorporated a list of new features, like a cartridge port for instant program loading, DMA for the AY soundchip, hardware scrolling, programmable interrupts, 16 hardware zoomable sprites (not vectorized) with an independent palette of 15 colours, and a choice of 4096 colours all in a new, sleek case which mimicked the keyboard-computer design that was <em>en vogue</em> in the 16-bit market (ST, Amiga etc). While the Amstrad Plus computers were arguably one of the best 8-bit computers ever built for the mass market, they died an early death as the 16-bit era had well and truly begun.</p>]]></description>

Even before fully completing the Apple-1 though, Wozniak was already dreaming of bigger and better things. A major goal he set in creating his next machine--the Apple ][--was to have it display in color. As he worked with potential hardware changes he began to realize the potential of the Apple ][ more and more. His previous experience with the game <a href="/breakout/3030-13049/" data-ref-id="3030-13049">Breakout</a> on the <a href="/atari-2600/3045-40/" data-ref-id="3045-40">Atari 2600</a> motivated Wozniak to essentially ensure the Apple ][ could be a great gaming machine. After Wozniak set up the new computer to display in color, he naturally continued on to add sound and then paddle control to the Apple ][. The Apple ][ was now a full blown gaming machine.</p><p style="">Though the designs of the Apple-1 and later the Apple ][ were basically Steve Wozniak's efforts alone, <a href="/steve-jobs/3040-9951/" data-ref-id="3040-9951">Steve Jobs</a> played a very important role in establishing the visual appearance of the Apple ][. While Wozniak wouldn't think twice about extra wires hanging about on a computer that worked, Jobs knew how to make an appealing package for people outside the once very niche computer enthusiast group. The Apple ][ was made to look quite different from other similar machines on the market. It had a much more user-friendly aesthetic. It almost looked like a <a href="/typewriter/3055-524/" data-ref-id="3055-524">typewriter</a> but at the same time was "futuristic" enough to clearly be seen as a computer. The case was user-friendly as well. It was easily removable which was rare at the time. Most similar devices warned against any type of self-service and didn't welcome exploration.</p><h2>The Apple ][ and Gaming</h2><p style="">Since Steve Wozniak designed the Apple ][ to be a gaming machine, it ended up being really successful as one. There were</p><figure style="width: 281px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7622/643363-mystery_house___apple_ii_render_emulation___2.png" data-ref-id="1300-643363" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.68683274021352" data-width="281" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:68.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7622/643363-mystery_house___apple_ii_render_emulation___2.png" data-ref-id="1300-643363"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7622/643363-mystery_house___apple_ii_render_emulation___2.png"></a><figcaption>Mystery House.</figcaption></figure><p style="">countless games either designed specifically for the Apple ][ or ported over from <a href="/arcade/3045-84/" data-ref-id="3045-84">arcade</a> versions or other systems versions over the years. One of the most important games to come from the Apple ][ early on though was a game called <a href="/mystery-house/3030-2744/" data-ref-id="3030-2744">Mystery House</a>. This was the first adventure style game to feature graphics of any kind. all previous games of this style were purely <a href="/text-based/3015-2199/" data-ref-id="3015-2199">text based</a>. A worthwhile side note is that Mystery House was created by <a href="/ken-williams/3040-928/" data-ref-id="3040-928">Ken</a> and <a href="/roberta-williams/3040-2073/" data-ref-id="3040-2073">Roberta Williams</a> who went on to start the company <a href="/sierra-entertainment-inc/3010-1030/" data-ref-id="3010-1030">Sierra Entertainment, Inc.</a> As previously mentioned, there were many ports of games that came to the Apple ][. Just a few of these titles include popular games such as:</p><ul><li><a href="/paperboy-rampage/3030-9961/" data-ref-id="3030-9961">Paper Boy</a></li><li><a href="/dig-dug/3030-2587/" data-ref-id="3030-2587">Dig Dug</a></li><li><a href="/donkey-kong/3030-311/" data-ref-id="3030-311">Donkey Kong</a></li><li><a href="/maniac-mansion/3030-2037/" data-ref-id="3030-2037">Maniac Mansion</a></li><li><a href="/bad-dudes/3030-10261/" data-ref-id="3030-10261">Bad Dudes</a></li><li><a href="/a-mind-forever-voyaging/3030-3250/" data-ref-id="3030-3250">A Mind Forever Voyaging</a></li><li><a href="/aliens-the-computer-game/3030-14797/" data-ref-id="3030-14797">Aliens:The computer game</a></li><li><a href="/arkanoid/3030-15107/" data-ref-id="3030-15107">Arkanoid</a></li><li>Arkanoid II</li><li>Dynasty</li><li>Depth Charge</li><li><a href="/f-15-strike-eagle/3030-10394/" data-ref-id="3030-10394">F-15 Strike Eagle</a></li><li><a href="/impossible-mission/3030-14849/" data-ref-id="3030-14849">Impossible Mission</a></li><li><a href="/impossible-mission-ii/3030-764/" data-ref-id="3030-764">Impossible Mission II</a></li><li><a href="/prince-of-persia/3030-2561/" data-ref-id="3030-2561">Prince of Persia</a></li><li><a href="/star-trek-the-kobayashi-alternative/3030-910/" data-ref-id="3030-910">Star Trek: The Kobayashi Alternative</a></li></ul><p style="">Most commercial software was provided on 5.25" floppy diskettes, but the earliest and cheapest disk drives of the era could only read one side at a time. This resulted in larger games being shipped on multiple, more expensive double-sided diskettes, and because there was no hard drive to install the software on to it, prompts would appear instructing the user when to swap or flip the diskettes to continue.</p><p style="">Even though the graphics were often pared down as the Apple ][ became older, it still provided Apple owners with roughly the same experience of these games. The Apple ][, along with machines like the <a href="/amiga/3045-1/" data-ref-id="3045-1">Amiga</a>, the <a href="/atari-8-bit/3045-24/" data-ref-id="3045-24">Atari 400 and 800</a>, and the <a href="/commodore-64/3045-14/" data-ref-id="3045-14">Commodore 64</a> (to an extent), single-handedly drove the microcomputer gaming era beginning in the late 70s.</p><h2>Hardware Details</h2><p style="">The Apple ][ was a very versatile computer in terms of hardware <i>and</i> software. The Apple ][ was actually the leader as a platform for launching new and unique hardware gadgets for quite some time after its initial launch in 1977. The popularity of the Apple ][ series kept it on the cutting edge of hardware/peripheral development until about 1991. That's nearly 15 years of hardware development for a single platform. Standard hardware components were included the Apple ][, such as keyboard, RAM, CPU, etc. The first Apple ][ models were built and shipped with 4K of memory, upgradable via expansion ports up to 48K. The Apple ]['s various expansion ports proved very useful for the many possible hardware upgrades to come in the future.</p><p style="">Hardware expansions were very common despite not always being very compatible or universal. Some of the general "upgrades" one could purchase and install included:</p><ul><li>Interface Cards</li><li>Video Cards</li><li>ROM/RAM expansion cards</li><li>Co-Processors</li><li>Accelerators</li><li>Printers</li><li>Alternate Input Devices (joysticks, paddles, etc.)</li></ul><p style="">The earliest Apple ][ keyboards are notable for not having a CAPS LOCK key, because the system typeface included in ROM had no lower-case letters. Graphical fonts could be used by applications to overcome this limitation, as the keyboard did have a Shift function for typing symbols placed above the number row.</p><p style="">The Apple logo on the case was emblazoned with a rainbow of stripes to signify the system's ability to produce color. Display monitors sold with the Apple ][ were generally monochrome, commonly in green or amber. The video capabilities of the system, however, were based on the NTSC video standard. Hooking up a normal household television to the computer would allow for compatible games and applications to display in a small but variable color palette, depending on the video mode used and the technique of signal modulation.</p><h2>Hardware Evolution and New Models</h2><h3>Apple ][ Plus</h3><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1296890-apple3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1296890" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1296890-apple3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1296890"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1296890-apple3.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1296890-apple3.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Apple II Plus</figcaption></figure><p style="">The Apple ][ Plus hardware was introduced to market in June 1979. Upgraded features included a ROM-integrated version of the Applesoft II BASIC programming language (supplied by Microsoft), and a much larger 48K bank of RAM now expandable to 64K.</p><p style="">The inclusion of the BASIC programming language in every model sold, rather than having to purchase it separately, provided a greater opportunity for every end user to explore programming and naturally game development on the system. Computer enthusiast magazines of this era would often include several pages of BASIC code that a user would painstakingly type in by hand, to run various utility or entertainment programs, some even including primitive graphics. In the event of an error in the printed code, a user could attempt debugging, or simply wait for the next magazine issue to print a correction.</p>]]></description>

It included an 8mhz Motorola 68000 CPU and 512kb RAM. Later models, called STFM, had a built-in floppy disk drive, RF-modulator and had the power supply built into the case. "ST" means Sixteen-Thirtytwo, because of the CPU's 16bit data bus and 32bit internals.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">It became popular in businesses because of the excellent office applications, in the homes of people because of the great games and amongst musicians because of its built-in MIDI ports and software like Cubase. The Atari ST was in direct competition with Commodore's <a href="/amiga/3045-1/" data-ref-id="3045-1">Amiga</a> and Apple's <a href="/mac/3045-17/" data-ref-id="3045-17">Macintosh</a> line of computers, and to some extent the <a href="/amstrad-cpc/3045-11/" data-ref-id="3045-11">Amstrad CPC</a> line of computers. The developement was lead by <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/jack-tramiel/3040-98032/" data-ref-id="3040-98032">Jack Tramiel</a>, who had recently left <a href="/commodore/3010-2000/" data-ref-id="3010-2000">Commodore </a>(Tramiel actually started the Commodore company and developed among other computers the <a href="/commodore-64/3045-14/" data-ref-id="3045-14">C64</a>.) to buy the rights to the Atari name. The Atari ST was intended to be an affordable computer with fast performance. But because it was supposed to be affordable, it is not as powerful in the audio and graphics department as the Commodore Amiga. Focus was instead put on including a fast CPU and lots of RAM.</p><h2>Hardware</h2><h3>Specifications</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">These are the basic specifications for the Atari 520ST:</p><ul><li><b>CPU:</b> Motorola 68000 16/32bit @ 8mhz. 16 bit data bus/32 bit internal/24-bit address bus.</li><li><b>RAM:</b> 512kb (1mb for the 1040ST models)</li><li><b>Soundchip:</b> Yamaha YM2149F 3-voice squarewave plus 1-voice white noise mono PSG(plus 2 channels on the STE models).</li><li><b>Diskdrive:</b> Single-sided 3½" floppy disk drive. 360kb capacity(1040ST had double-sided drives which had a capacity of 720kb).</li><li><b>Display:</b> 60 Hz NTSC, 50 Hz PAL, 71.2 Hz monochrome:</li></ul><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Low Resolution - 320×200 (16 color), palette of 512 colors</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Medium resolution - 640×200 (4 color), palette of 512 colors</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">High resolution - 640×400 (mono), monochrome</p><ul><li><b>Ports:</b> TV out (on ST-M and ST-FM models, NTSC or PAL standard RF modulated), MIDI in/out (with 'out-thru'), RS-232 serial, Centronics parallel (printer), monitor (RGB or Composite Video colour and mono, 13-pin DIN), extra disk drive port (15-pin DIN), DMA port (ACSI port, Atari Computer System Interface) for hard disks and Atari Laser Printer (sharing RAM with computer system), joystick and mouse ports (9-pin MSX standard).</li><li><b>Operating System:</b> TOS (<b>T</b>he <b>O</b>perating <b>S</b>ystem) with the GEM user interface.</li></ul><h3>Models</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">There are a couple of different models of the Atari ST. They are:</p><ul><li><b>Atari 130ST</b> - Never released. Was supposed to come with only 128kb ram. But the operating system alone took up almost all that amount, so they canceled it.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Atari 260ST</b> - Only released in Europe. It was first only a prototype just like the 130ST but was eventually released in Europe. It is identical to the 520ST and was released to differentiate it from the new 520ST+.</li><li><b>Atari 520ST</b> - The original model described in Specifications.</li><li><b>Atari 520STM</b> - Model with only RF modulation built in, without floppy drive. Not very common.</li><li><b>Atari 520STFM</b> - Built-in floppy drive, RF modulator and power supply.</li><li><b>Atari 520ST</b><strong>+</strong><b> </b> - 1mb RAM but no floppy drive.</li><li><b>Atari 1040STF</b> - A 520ST with built in double sided DD disk drive and 1mb ram. But without RF modulator.</li><li><b>Atari 1040STFM</b> - A 520ST with built in double sided DD disk drive, 1mb ram and RF modulator.</li><li><b>Mega ST</b> - Redesigned motherboard. Comes with 2 or 4mb of RAM. Includes a real-time clock and an internal connector for expansion. Most models also includes the BLiTTER graphics chip.</li><li><b>520STE and 1040STE</b> - Same as 520STFM/1040STFM but includes the BLiTTER graphics chip and has enhanced sound and color palettes. The sound chip has 2 extra channels that can be used for sampled sounds. The color palette is extended to 4096 colors. Unfortunately the STE specific features were rarely used in commercial software.</li><li><b>Mega STE</b> - Same hardware as the 1040STE has, but with a 16mhz CPU.</li><li><b>STacy</b> - A portable version of the ST.</li><li><b>ST BOOK </b>- Portable version of the STE. It was more portable than the STacy but sacrifice many features in order to achieve that.</li></ul><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Prototypes/Vaporware (Never Officially Released)</p><ul><li>1040 STE+ (STE 2080) – Similar to the 1040STE but with a additional, intern AMD 80286 CPU and a 40MB HD (2,5")</li></ul><h2>Operating System</h2><h3>Details</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The operating system in the Atari ST is called TOS which means simply "The Operating System". It combines the GEM GUI and the underlying GEMDOS, a DOS like operating system, both by Digital Research. TOS is stored in onboard ROM chips, though early versions of the Atari ST came with TOS on floppy disks. Because it is stored on ROM chips it boots up instantly. Some people jokingly says that TOS means "Tremiel Operating System", since Jack Tremiel was the one leading the developement of the Atari ST.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">TOS is composed of the following parts:</p><ul><li><b>GEMDOS</b> - GEM Disk Operating System (A DOS-like operating system Digital Research had experimented with a little bit before Atari decided to use GEM.)</li><li><b>GEM</b> - Graphical Environment Manager (A graphical environment. GEM itself consists of AES, VDI and GEM Desktop.)</li></ul><ul><li><b>AES</b> - Application Environment Service (Provides the window system, window manager and other GUI elements.)</li></ul><ul><li><b>VDI</b> - Virtual Device Interface (The core graphics system of the GEM engine.)</li><li><b>GEM</b> Desktop (An application using AES to provide a file manager and application launcher.)</li><li><b>BIOS</b> - Basic Input/Output System</li><li><b>XBIOS</b> - Extended BIOS</li><li><b>Line-A</b> (Low-level high-speed graphics calls.)</li></ul><ul><li><b>GDOS</b> - Graphics Device Operation System (Sends commands from VDI to the proper device driver for rendering graphics.)</li><li><b>AHDI</b> - Atari Hard Disk Interface (Driver for Hard Drive. Has to be loaded seperately.)</li></ul><h3>Desktop</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9560/779987-220078_16_atarigem.gif" data-ref-id="1300-779987" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9560/779987-220078_16_atarigem.gif" data-ref-id="1300-779987"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9560/779987-220078_16_atarigem.gif"></a><figcaption>The GEM desktop in low resolution (320x200)</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The desktop looks like most other desktops in that it uses icons to represent devices and files, and has windows and dialog boxes. The standard desktop has a trashcan and two floppy disk icons, even if you only have one floppy drive. On the top part is a context sensitive panel. It changes it's contents depending on the application (much like on a Macintosh), though applications are not required to even use the panel in which case it is removed.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">TOS can execute a variety of different filetypes. They can be identified by their extensions:</p><ul><li><b>*.ACC</b> - Desktop accessory. Loaded automatically when the application loads.</li><li><b>*.APP</b> - Application.

Apple sued Digital Research over this and Digital Reasearch had to redesign their GEM window manager for other architectures. But since it was mostly Atari who developed the Motorola 68000 version, they were given the rights to further develop the 68k version without Digital Research's consent. Because of this, Atari was not affected by the Apple-Digital Research lawsuit and were allowed to have a more Mac-like look and feel.</p><h2>Demo scene</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9560/699568-virtual_escape.gif" data-ref-id="1300-699568" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="400" style="width: 400px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9560/699568-virtual_escape.gif" data-ref-id="1300-699568"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9560/699568-virtual_escape.gif" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9560/699568-virtual_escape.gif"></noscript></a><figcaption>"Virtual Escape" demo by Equinox</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">As with most other early computers, there is a scene of people still active on the Atari ST platform. They use the ST to create productions called "demos", which is a program demonstrating the demo group's programming, graphics making and music composing abilities on limited hardware.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The groups came up with new programming techniques to push the limits of the computer to do things that people would've only dreamed about doing years ago. Some of these techniques were later used in games for the Atari ST. For example the technique to display graphics in the borders of the screen.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9560/699564-left_border.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-699564" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5825" data-width="400" style="width: 400px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:58.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9560/699564-left_border.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-699564"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9560/699564-left_border.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9560/699564-left_border.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>"Death of the left border" screen by TNT Crew.</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Since the Atari ST was not powerful enough to display graphics in fullscreen, Atari put borders on the sides of the screen. But after many years of experimenting, people in the demo scene removed those borders one by one, starting with the upper border. The last border to be removed was the left one that was thought to be impossible to remove. But once again a demo group succeeded with removing the border and were finally able to display graphics in fullscreen. Of course, this had an impact on performance, so you couldn't do everything you could do otherwise.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The people in the demo scene on the Atari ST were also very involved in the game side of things. Some demo groups even started their own game companies and made some of the best games for the ST with the techniques they had invented, like the mentioned ability to put graphics where the borders should have been.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">One example of this is in the game <a href="/lethal-xcess-wings-of-death-ii/3030-11117/" data-ref-id="3030-11117">Lethal Xcess</a>. <a href="/thalion-software/3010-1964/" data-ref-id="3010-1964">Thalion Software</a> who made the game, put the HUD in the upper border of the screen so that the playing field wouldn't be smaller. Thalion Software was comprised of people from various demo groups and made some of the best games for the Atari ST, like <a href="/amberstar/3030-10464/" data-ref-id="3030-10464">Amberstar</a> and <a href="/enchanted-land/3030-23957/" data-ref-id="3030-23957">Enchanted Land</a>.

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Summary</h2><p style="">The Commodore 64 (C64) is an 8-bit home computer released in August of 1982, and was the third system made by Commodore International. The starting price was $595 USD. The computer was named for its 64 kilobytes of RAM; superior to most mainstream personal computers at the time. The C64 is occasionally rendered: C=64 due to the original system's use of the "commodore symbol" which resembles a 'C' merged with an equal sign.</p><h2>History</h2><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9566/397494-home_c64_perip.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-397494" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.1633333333333" data-width="300" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 300px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:116.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9566/397494-home_c64_perip.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-397494"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9566/397494-home_c64_perip.jpg"></a><figcaption>Commodore 64</figcaption></figure><p style="">The Commodore 64 began development when Commodore Inc. bought MOS Technology. Unable to sell their technology in the mass market, MOS Tech approached Commodore in hopes of collaborating with their latest 6501 microprocessor. MOS had hoped to sell the microprocessor to console manufactures, but Commodore had other plans. MOS was also eager to sell their new SID sound chip in hopes that partnering with Commodore would give them an edge in the digital sound market. The iconic sound of the MOS SID chip was considered groundbreaking at the time, and video game sound composers used it to create entire in-game audio tracks.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/1134666-clip_image001_0050.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1134666" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.0233333333333" data-width="300" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 300px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:102.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/1134666-clip_image001_0050.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1134666"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8273/1134666-clip_image001_0050.jpg"></a><figcaption>Jack Tramiel</figcaption></figure><p style=""><a href="/jack-tramiel/3040-98032/" data-ref-id="3040-98032">Jack Tramiel</a>, founder of Commodore Business Machines, felt that the microprocessor was perfect for the new line of computers he had in mind. The chip would be the main microprocessor for the <a href="/vic-20/3045-30/" data-ref-id="3045-30">VIC-20</a>.</p><p style="">The project was given to Commodore Japan; an engineering team led by <a href="/y-terakura/3040-65272/" data-ref-id="3040-65272">Yash Terakura</a> created the VIC-1001 for the <a href="/japan/3035-37/" data-ref-id="3035-37">Japanese </a>market. The VIC-20 was marketed in Japan as VIC-1001 before VIC-20 was introduced to the US.

This project was eventually cancelled after just a few machines were manufactured for the Japanese market. The Commodore MAX hardware was the basis for the Commodore 64, and was the first computer of the C64 hardware family.</p><p style="">During the 1982 Consumer Electronics Show, the Commodore 64 was announced to enthusiasm. When the C64 was rolled out, it had an extremely low $595 price tag. Companies such as Intel and Atari had no idea how Commodore was making money on the computer. In reality, Commodore was using new and sometimes untested tech for their computer as opposed to licensing older tech from large competing corporations.</p><h2>Reception and Market Share</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2238/379346-karateka_c64_8.png" data-ref-id="1300-379346" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2238/379346-karateka_c64_8.png" data-ref-id="1300-379346"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2238/379346-karateka_c64_8.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2238/379346-karateka_c64_8.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>C64 Version of Karateka</figcaption></figure><p style="">Throughout its 12 year lifespan, the C64 sold over 17 million units. As such, it remains one of the best-selling personal computer models of all time. From 1983-1985, the Commodore 64 dominated the personal computer market with a 40% share. It then went on to outsell former market leaders Apple and Intel, and led Commodore to winning the personal computer market war. Its successor, the <a href="/commodore-128/3045-58/" data-ref-id="3045-58">Commodore 128</a>, was released in 1985 and was fully backwards compatible with most C64 software but was far less successful than the C64.</p><p style="">In all, about 10,000 commercial software were made for the C64, including development tools, office applications, games, and more. The C64 is currently used by hobbyists, and C64 games are available for purchase on the Wii Shop Channel in Europe and the United States.</p><h2>Hardware Specifications</h2><ul><li><b>CPU</b>: 8-bit MOS Technology 6510, 1.023 MHz</li><li><b>Memory</b>: 64KB RAM</li><li><b>Graphics</b>: MOS Technology VIC-II, 16 colors</li><li><b>Sound</b>: MOS Technology SID 6581/8580</li></ul><h3>SID Music</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9560/1303137-6581.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1303137" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="300" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 300px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9560/1303137-6581.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1303137"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9560/1303137-6581.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9560/1303137-6581.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>SID 6581</figcaption></figure><p style="">The Commodore 64's SID chip played a prominent role in the development of video game music, <a href="/chiptune/3015-3745/" data-ref-id="3015-3745">chiptunes</a>, and the demo, crack, and warez scenes. SID (itself an acronym for Sound Interface Device) was created by Robert Yannes, an engineer who later moved to the synthesizer industry. Yannes stated that he felt previous computer sound chips had been designed by people who did not understand music, and sought to design a chip that would be useful for musicians. Previously, there had been a single chip for both audio and video, so a dedicated chip for audio provided musicians with much more freedom and range.</p><p style="">The initial run of the SID chip, the SID 6581, was extremely popular, and instrumental in the success of the Commodore 64. It allowed for much more freedom comparative to previous chips, such as three oscillators, each of which could produce four separate waveforms. Additionally, many composers were able to find loopholes to make their music even more complex, such as a glitch that essentially created a fourth channel for 4-bit samples. Some games that took advantage of this were <a href="/impossible-mission/3030-14849/" data-ref-id="3030-14849">Impossible Mission</a> and <a href="/ghostbusters/3030-11874/" data-ref-id="3030-11874">Ghostbusters</a>, both of which used voice samples.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1843060-0.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1843060" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1843060-0.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1843060"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1843060-0.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1843060-0.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Many cracktros, such as this one, took advantage of the SID's capabilities</figcaption></figure><p style="">Many well-known composers and developers had their start with the SID chip, such as <a href="/rob-hubbard/3040-2834/" data-ref-id="3040-2834">Rob Hubbard</a> and <a href="/martin-galway/3040-5357/" data-ref-id="3040-5357">Martin Galway</a>. These men have contributed to such games as <a href="/arkanoid/3030-15107/" data-ref-id="3030-15107">Arkanoid</a>, <a href="/wizball/3030-15894/" data-ref-id="3030-15894">Wizball</a>, <a href="/yie-ar-kung-fu/3030-15480/" data-ref-id="3030-15480">Yie Ar Kung-Fu</a>, <a href="/commando/3030-6850/" data-ref-id="3030-6850">Commando</a>, <a href="/monty-on-the-run/3030-105/" data-ref-id="3030-105">Monty on the Run</a>, and <a href="/skate-or-die/3030-8819/" data-ref-id="3030-8819">Skate or Die!</a>. The composition process was initially very rough; composers would have to input a sequence of hexadecimal bytes where each line would describe the note, pitch, length, etc. of the sound being played.</p><p style="">By the mid-1980s, SID musicians were improving to a point where they could effectively emulate "real" music. Games such as <a href="/times-of-lore/3030-6900/" data-ref-id="3030-6900">Times of Lore</a> were able to use mainstream songs as inspiration, and adapt that to a SID song. Also at this time, demo groups began to rise in popularity, with several Commodore 64 magazines releasing songs from their readers. The impact of SID music is evident as well, with songs still being developed to this day. While many musicians utilize emulation, some continue to use the original SID chips.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>History</h2><p style="">The MSX home computer architecture standard was conceived by <a href="/ascii-corporation/3010-805/" data-ref-id="3010-805">ASCII Microsoft</a> executive <a href="/kazuhiko-nishio/3040-92150/" data-ref-id="3040-92150">Kazuhiko Nishi</a>. Inspired by the success of VHS as a standard for video cassette recorders he had proposed the MSX standard as a single industry standard for home computers. This was many years before the <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC</a> later became a standardized home computer architecture.</p><p style="">The MSX standard was first formally announced in 1983 and was followed by three other standards: MSX2 (1986), MSX2 (1988) and MSX turbo R (1990).</p><p style="">Over a hundred different companies have manufactured MSX computers. The list of companies includes: <a href="/sony-computer-entertainment-america/3010-313/" data-ref-id="3010-313">Sony</a>, <a href="/panasonic-interactive-media/3010-1546/" data-ref-id="3010-1546">Panasonic</a>, Sanyo, JVC, Spectravideo, <a href="/toshiba-corporation/3010-2638/" data-ref-id="3010-2638">Toshiba</a>, Canon, <a href="/casio-co-ltd/3010-2008/" data-ref-id="3010-2008">Casio</a>, Dragon, Dyndata, <a href="/fujitsu/3010-6596/" data-ref-id="3010-6596">Fujitsu</a>, Hitachi, Sharp/Epcom, <a href="/pioneer-productions/3010-845/" data-ref-id="3010-845">Pioneer</a>, Alalamia, Mitsubishi, NEC, <a href="/philips-interactive-media-inc/3010-48/" data-ref-id="3010-48">Philips</a>, Radiola, Schneider, Talent, Telematica, Yamaha, Yashica, Aster International, General, Samsung, Hyosung, Limco, Oric, Radofin.</p><p style="">Although it was developed by Microsoft's Japanese partner, Microsoft itself showed little support for the project beyond making the system software, and the MSX-based machines were seldom seen in the <a href="/the-united-states-of-america/3035-396/" data-ref-id="3035-396">United States</a>. Most of the Japanese companies decided to avoid the intensely competitive U.S. market, only Spectravideo and Yamaha decided otherwise.

      <deck><![CDATA[The ZX Spectrum is one of the most popular European computers of all time.  Its software library is enormous and its fame in Europe rivals the Commodore 64 in the US.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">The <a data-ref-id="3010-938" href="/sinclair-research-ltd/3010-938/">Sinclair</a> ZX Spectrum was the successor to the ZX 81 released in the <a data-ref-id="3035-492" href="/united-kingdom/3035-492/">UK</a> by Sinclair Research Ltd. in 1982. Affectionately regarded as the "Speccy," the Spectrum was Sinclair's first computer capable of color output, and is widely recognized for its complex 40-key rubber keyboard. The ZX Spectrum was particularly successful in the UK, and was one of the most popular personal computer throughout Europe in the 1980s. The popularity of the Spectrum in Europe can be compared to that of the <a data-ref-id="3045-14" href="/commodore-64/3045-14/">Commodore 64</a> in <a data-ref-id="3035-1664" href="/north-america/3035-1664/">North America</a> as it was made to be the cheapest available color computer at the time. It was a well supported platform with a variety of companies developing software for it, including many games. There were eight models of the Spectrum produced between 1982 and 1987, and the recognizable computer spawned a good deal of clones and imitators.</p><h2>Technical Specifications</h2><ul><li><em>CPU</em> - Zilog Z80A 3.5 MHz processor</li><li><em>Memory</em> - 16 Kb / 48 Kb / 128 Kb</li><li><em>Video</em> - 256 x 192 resolution, 15 colors (7 shades bright mode for each black), each 8 x 8 pixel square limited to a max of 2 colors.</li><li><em>Audio</em> - 16K / 48K models have 1 channel with 1-bit sound using a 10-octave built-in beepe. 128K model has 3 channels of 4-bit sound using an AY-3-8912 sound chip. Some 48k models use the AY chip.</li><li><em>Media</em> - Cassette tapes via the cassette recorder peripheral</li><li><em>Built-in Language</em> - Sinclair Basic</li><li><em>Keyboard</em> - QWERTY layout with 40 rubber keys. Keys have up to 6 functions each.</li><li><em>Size/Weight</em> - 23 x 14.4 x 3 cm / 550g</li><li><em>IO Ports</em> - Expansion port, RF video out</li><li><em>Power Supply</em> - External PSU, 9v DC, 1.4A</li></ul><h2>Models</h2><h3>ZX Spectrum 16K</h3><p style="">The 16K model was the entry level model manufactured by <a data-ref-id="3010-938" href="/sinclair-research-ltd/3010-938/">Sinclair</a> in 1982. It launched alongside the 48K model and was very similar except for the memory difference. The original ZX Spectrum is very widely recognized for its signature rubber keyboard and rainbow flair in the corner of the device. It was small, easy to use and cheap. The 16K model launched at £125 and later dropped to £99. A 32K RAM upgrade was available for 16K users to upgrade their systems to 48K. Users could mail in their systems and they'd have their Spectrums fitted with a 32K daughterboard that made it essentially identical to the 48K model. An interesting note is that to save money on these RAM expansions, Sinclair used defective 64K chips with only 32K RAm actually working or available. Third parties released 32K RAM expansion packs that plugged into the expansion port as well.</p><p style="">The <a data-ref-id="3055-2361" href="/keyboard/3055-2361/">keyboard</a> of the computer is considered to be terrible for typists. The rubber keys are mushy, and the fact that keys can have up to 6 functions each means that even typing basic commands requires extensive use of the function keys. The 256x192 resolution of the computer was above average for its time, and the choice of 8 colors (15 including "BRIGHT" colors) set it apart from the competition. The downside to the Spectrum's color was that only two colors could be in a single 8x8px square. This caused a problem called <em>attribute clash (also known as color clash)</em> which required creative graphic design to circumvent.</p><h3>ZX Spectrum 48K</h3><p style="">The 48K model launched alongside the 16K model in 1982 and retailed for £175. The price was later reduced to £129. The 48K model is virtually the same as the 16K model, with the obvious exception being the upgraded RAM.</p><h3>ZX Spectrum+</h3><p style="">In 1984, two years after the release of the original Spectrum, Sinclair released the upgraded ZX Spectrum+. The ZX Spectrum+ was a 48K Spectrum in a Sinclair-QL style case (another computer launched in 1984). The most important change with the Spectrum+ was the introduction of a "professional keyboard" which had injection-molded plastic keys rather than rubber ones. The keys still rested on a rubber membrane and while it improved upon the original design, many users did not find it completely satisfactory.</p><p style="">The ZX Spectrum+ retailed for £179.95 and a do-it-yourself upgrade kit was released for £50, which allowed a user to upgrade any rubber-keyed Spectrum with plastic keys. The price was cut to £129.95 with the release of the Spectrum 128. The plastic keys on the Spectrum had a tendency to fall off, and retailers expressed failure rates ranging from 5% to as high as 30%.</p><h3><strong>ZX Spectrum 128</strong></h3><p style="">The Spectrum 128 was an evolution of the ZX Spectrum lineup, sporting 128K RAM, 3 channel audio, MIDI compatibility, a serial port, RGB video out, 32Kb ROM, an improved BASIC editor, and an external keypad. The Spectrum 128 also fixed the "dot crawl" problem that earlier units suffered from. It was developed by Sinclair in conjunction with their spanish distributer Investronica. It was unveiled and launched in Spain in 1985 for 44,250 pesatas; the English release was pushed back until 1986 because of unsold Spectrum inventory and retailed for £179.95. The English Spectrum 128 did not include an external keypad and the keypad port was renamed "AUX." The keypad was released separately for £19.95 and did not sell well.</p><p style="">The Spectrum 128 suffered from being released after the holiday season to an uninterested public. The new hardware had compatibility issues with old software and peripherals. Months after the Spectrum 128 was launched, Amstrad took over Sinclair's computing business and discontinued the Spectrum 128. It only retailed for about half a year.</p><h3><strong>ZX Spectrum +2</strong></h3><p style="">The <a data-ref-id="3010-3924" href="/amstrad/3010-3924/">Amstrad</a> ZX Spectrum +2 was the first Spectrum-branded computer released after Amstrad acquired the Sinclair brand and computing business. It was released in 1987 for £139–£149 and marked a huge turning point for the Spectrum brand. It was the first Spectrum to be released with a proper spring-loaded keyboard, two joystick ports, and a built in tape recorder. The case is dark gray and similar to the <a data-ref-id="3045-11" href="/amstrad-cpc/3045-11/">Amstrad CPC</a> 464.</p><p style="">The computer was also released in black as the <strong>ZX Spectrum +2A</strong> with the revised motherboard of the Spectrum 3. The internals were similar to those of the Spectrum 128, except the ROM was changed around a bit causing further incompatibility issues. A <strong>ZX Spectrum +2B</strong> followed in late 1987 when manufacturing of the machine moved from Hong Kong to Taiwan, but the internals remained identical. But before they made these in taiwan they made these in the uk</p><p style="">The Spectrum +2 was the first Spectrum marketed almost exclusive as a game machine, and as a result it sold very well. One of the Spectrum +2 bundles was the <a data-ref-id="3030-7365" href="/james-bond-007/3030-7365/">James Bond 007</a> Action Pack, which game with a <a data-ref-id="3015-2354" href="/light-gun/3015-2354/">light gun</a> and <a data-ref-id="3025-369" href="/james-bond/3025-369/">James Bond</a> games.</p><h3>ZX Spectrum +3</h3><p style="">The Spectrum +3 marks the final and most advanced Spectrum computer, and was released in 1987 for £249, with a price drop bringing it down to £199. It remained in production until 1990. It featured a 3" floppy disk drive, a parallel print port, and a new ROM. The Spectrum +3 also had a revised motherboard with drastically fewer chips than previous models. Continuing the trend of new Spectrum models, this more advanced computer was even more severely incompatible with old software and hardware. The 3" floppy drive used proprietary Amstrad disks and the computer as a whole was drastically overpriced compared to more advanced competing computers at the time such as the the <a data-ref-id="3045-1" href="/amiga/3045-1/">Amiga</a> 500.</p><p style="">Like the Spectrum +2, the Spectrum +3 was marketed as game device and sold in various "action packs" however it did not enjoy nearly the same success as its predecessor. The incompatibilities, 3" Amstrad floppy drive, and most importantly death of the 8-bit computer market all contributed to the computer's eventual failure and the end of the Spectrum line.</p><h3>Clones</h3><p style="">The ZX Spectrum is perhaps the most cloned computer line in all history. Sinclair licensed the Spectrum's design to Timex and a North American derivative named the Timex Sinclair 2068 was released. This "official" clone was largely incompatible with Sinclair software and within two years of the Timex-Sinclair partnership, Timex dropped out due to huge losses. Many more illegal clones were produced in countries such as the <a data-ref-id="3035-507" href="/soviet-union/3035-507/">USSR</a>, Czechoslovakia, Romania, <a data-ref-id="3035-1083" href="/hong-kong/3035-1083/">Hong Kong</a>, <a data-ref-id="3035-2867" href="/argentina/3035-2867/">Argentina</a>, <a data-ref-id="3035-720" href="/brazil/3035-720/">Brazil</a> and Spectrum clones continue to be produced in <a data-ref-id="3035-38" href="/russia/3035-38/">Russia</a>. The SAM Coupe is often considered a Spectrum clone because of its emulated Spectrum compatibility, as well as the fact it was produced by a Spectrum peripheral manufacturer. Dozens of clones and variants of the ZX Spectrum are known to exist.</p><h2>Software</h2><p style="">The ZX Spectrum had a very simple architechture but an extraordinarily diverse software library consisting of over 14,000 titles. Software applications included programming language implementations, Sinclair BASIC extensions, word processors, databases, office software, artist tools, music composition, and a great deal of games. Spectrum software was originally distributed on cassette tapes, read in with the tape recorder expansion. Load times were very long and could be anywhere from 3-12 minutes depending on the size of the program. While data on cassettes was reliable and widely used, the release of the Spectrum 3 with its build in floppy drive brought about around 700 floppy disk titles to the Spectrum's library throughout the decade after its release.</p><h3>Notable Games</h3><ul><li><a data-ref-id="3030-7959" href="/3d-deathchase/3030-7959/">3D Deathchase</a></li><li>All or Nothing</li><li><a data-ref-id="3030-16034" href="/batman-the-movie/3030-16034/">Batman: The Movie</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3030-2991" href="/boulder-dash/3030-2991/">Boulder Dash</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3030-13281" href="/chase-hq/3030-13281/">Chase H.Q.</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3030-8827" href="/dizzy-the-ultimate-cartoon-adventure/3030-8827/">Dizzy</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3030-7068" href="/head-over-heels/3030-7068/">Head Over Heels</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3030-5005" href="/jet-set-willy/3030-5005/">Jet Set Willy</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3030-3209" href="/magicland-dizzy/3030-3209/">Magicland Dizzy</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3030-17856" href="/manic-miner/3030-17856/">Manic Miner</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3030-7405" href="/midnight-resistance/3030-7405/">Midnight Resistance</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3030-14869" href="/operation-wolf/3030-14869/">Operation Wolf</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3030-13745" href="/r-type/3030-13745/">R-Type</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3030-10764" href="/rainbow-islands/3030-10764/">Rainbow Islands</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3030-18455" href="/rebelstar/3030-18455/">Rebelstar</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3030-21323" href="/robocop/3030-21323/">RoboCop</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3030-18433" href="/robocop-2/3030-18433/">RoboCop 2</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3030-13537" href="/stop-the-express/3030-13537/">Stop the Express</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3030-9769" href="/target-renegade/3030-9769/">Target: Renegade</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3030-4798" href="/the-sentinel/3030-4798/">The Sentinel</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3030-7275" href="/tll-tornado-low-level/3030-7275/">Tornado Low Level</a></li></ul><h2>Peripherals</h2><p style="">A few first party peripherals were released for the ZX Spectrum including:</p><p style=""><em>ZX Printer</em> - This was already on the market when the Spectrum was released. It was a ZX81 printer backwards compatible with the Spectrum.</p><p style=""><em>ZX Interface 1</em> - An interface that added 8KB of ROM, a serial port, a LAN interface called ZX Net, and an interface for up to 8 ZX Microdrives, a propriety form of fast tape storage.</p><p style=""><em>ZX Interface 2</em> - An interface that added 2 controller ports and a ROM cartridge slot which had instant loading. Only 10 games were commercially produced on ROM cartridges.</p><p style=""><em>ZX Microdrive</em> - A small, fast, and somewhat unreliable tape-roll storage medium released by Sinclair.</p><p style="">A very popular third party peripheral was the <em>Kempston Joystick Interface</em>. It allowed the user of controllers complying with the Atari 2600 standard to be used in Spectrum games and was greatly supported. Many other peripherals were released such as disk drives, controller interfaces, serial interfaces, RAM upgrades, speech synthesizers, a drum kit and even a modem.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>History</h2><p style="">The Macintosh was designed as part of a skunkworks operation originally headed by Jef Raskin. Raskin planned to create an easy to use and affordable appliance computer for use by ordinary people.

Despite his heavy involvement in the inital stages of the Lisa project, Jobs eventually caught wind of the Macintosh project and gradually turned his full attention to it. In 1981, Raskin departed the team over a dispute with Jobs, making Steve the de facto leader.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/66/521728-macintosh.gif" data-ref-id="1300-521728" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.145" data-width="200" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 200px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:114.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/66/521728-macintosh.gif" data-ref-id="1300-521728"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/66/521728-macintosh.gif"></a><figcaption>The Original Macintosh</figcaption></figure><p style="">It was under Jobs that the Mac became a GUI-oriented computer, influenced by a tour given to Apple staff of Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center which included looks at PARC's Alto computer and the related Smalltalk software. The computer eventually released in 1984 as a vertically-oriented all-in-one and was gradually revised over the course of the decade. Eventually, Apple began to offer Macs in different formats, ranging from standard desktops to early laptops and other portable designs.</p><p style="">The Mac's popularity was at first fairly high, but after Steve Jobs was stripped of power within Apple (eventually departing to form NeXT), executives who did not fully understand the platform began to devalue it (notably, Apple was criticized in the nineties for offering an absurd amount of Macs which were too similar and had generic names) and the platform struggled. To compound these problems, Apple's Mac System (later Mac OS), the OS powering the Macs, was hopelessly outdated and needed replacing.</p><p style="">Unfortunately, Apple's internal software R&amp;D had become bloated and ineffectual, stalling development on the next-generation Mac OS codenamed Copland. In 1996, Apple wrote it off as a sinking ship and decided to source the basis for their next-generation operating system from elsewhere. Several options were considered, such as licensing Microsoft's NT architecture and purchasing Be, Inc. for its BeOS. In the end though, it was Apple founder Steve Jobs and his NeXT outfit which Apple decided to buy, allowing them to base what would become OS X (as in the roman numeral for 10) on NeXT's powerful and robust OpenSTEP OS.</p><p style="">This also brought Jobs back into the company. He quickly assumed control and began to turn the Mac platform around. Jobs trimmed the bloat from the product line and steadily began to focus on releasing stylish computers like the iMac and iBook for consumers and powerhouses for the Mac's creative professional base like the PowerBook and PowerMac lines.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/66/428003-imac2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-428003" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.6" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:60.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/66/428003-imac2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-428003"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/66/428003-imac2.jpg"></a><figcaption>iMac, Apple's Flagship Mac</figcaption></figure><p style="">Since then, the Mac has become known as a stylish computer for the image conscious, as well as a great tool for artists, writers, film editors and so on. Since approximately halfway through the first decade of the 21st Century, Apple has begun to play up the Mac as a games platform, something for which it had developed a reputation for being poor at. This took several forms, most visibly the appearance of <a href="/electronic-arts/3010-1/" data-ref-id="3010-1" data-mce-href="/electronic-arts/3010-1/">EA</a> at an Apple event to promote the fact that they were bringing a number of games to the platform.</p><p style="">Despite the perception of the Mac as a second-rate games platform (by comparison to the dominant Windows PC), it has played host to a number of popular exclusives, most notably much of <a href="/bungie-studios/3010-476/" data-ref-id="3010-476" data-mce-href="/bungie-studios/3010-476/">Bungie's</a> earlier games (before the Microsoft buyout) catalog. In fact, Bungie's <a href="/halo-combat-evolved/3030-2600/" data-ref-id="3030-2600" data-mce-href="/halo-combat-evolved/3030-2600/">Halo</a>, a huge hit for the Xbox, was originally a Mac exclusive, built on <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/opengl/3015-5192/" data-ref-id="3015-5192" data-mce-href="//www.giantbomb.com/opengl/3015-5192/">OpenGL</a>. The game later found its way onto Mac as a port of the PC release.</p><h3>Windows Gaming on the Mac</h3><p style="">On April 5, 2006 Apple released a beta version of a new piece of software called Boot Camp. Due to the recent change in architecture - PowerPC to Intel - Mac and Windows computers were now more similar than ever. Boot Camp embraced this by allowing the user to install Windows on a Mac. Windows XP - and later Windows Vista and 7 - now ran natively on Macintosh computers, making gaming on Mac's easier than ever.</p><p style="">With the release of Mac OS 10.5 (Leopard), Boot Camp comes pre-installed on all Mac's and is thus officially supported by Apple. Although many Mac users are unwilling to install Windows on their computer, Boot Camp still offers Mac users something they've never had before - the ability to run any PC game 100% natively.</p><h3>Steam for Mac</h3><p style="">On March 8th, 2010, <a href="/valve-corporation/3010-1374/" data-ref-id="3010-1374" data-mce-href="/valve-corporation/3010-1374/">Valve</a> announced that it would begin a new <a href="/steam/3015-718/" data-ref-id="3015-718" data-mce-href="/steam/3015-718/">Steam</a> program for the Mac. Under this new system, Valve games would be able to run natively on the Mac, and 3rd parties would be able to release a Mac version of their game on Steam. Also announced is a program called Steam Play, where players who buy the Mac version of a game will also be able to download the PC version of the same game free of charge. Steam for Mac was released on May 12, 2010.</p><h3>Mac App Store</h3><p style="">Mimicking their strategy with the <a href="/iphone/3045-96/" data-ref-id="3045-96" data-mce-href="/iphone/3045-96/">iOS</a> platform, Apple has recently added an integrated App Store to the Mac OS. Users can purchase Applications in the same way as on iOS. Apps are then downloaded to a user's system and the App Store App itself keeps track of updates for these Apps. In addition, once an App is purchased, users are free to install it on any other Mac computer by logging into the Mac App Store with the same Apple Account.</p><p style="">This service, just like on iOS, extends to games and already a number of Publishers have made classic and more recent titles available for purchase on the Mac App Store. These games range from recent and current hits to old favourites, to popular indie games like the <a href="/penny-arcade-adventures-on-the-rain-slick-precipice-of-darkness-episode-one/3030-20696/" data-ref-id="3030-20696" data-mce-href="/penny-arcade-adventures-on-the-rain-slick-precipice-of-darkness-episode-one/3030-20696/">Penny Arcade Adventures</a> episodes and also ports of existing iOS games like <a href="/angry-birds/3025-1879/" data-ref-id="3025-1879" data-mce-href="/angry-birds/3025-1879/">Angry Birds</a>.</p>]]></description>

The model number is PSP-2000, then commonly referred to as the PSP Slim. The Slim replaced the original (or ''phat'') PSP on the market and had significant hardware changes. The amount of RAM in the PSP-2000 was doubled from 32 megabytes to 64 megabytes. This added RAM was primarily used to decrease UMD load times, and to improve the memory limit when browsing web pages. The Slim's battery was manufactured to supply the same amount of playtime as the Phat battery while attaining a smaller form factor. The WLAN switch was relocated to the top of the device, and the UMD drive now required the user to open it manually, as opposed to the spring-loaded version in the PSP-1000 that was activated using a switch.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The PSP Slim was released in September of 2007.</p><h2>PSP-3000 (PSP Brite)</h2><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4705/589004-pspshowdown2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-589004" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4705/589004-pspshowdown2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-589004"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4705/589004-pspshowdown2.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4705/589004-pspshowdown2.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>PSP Slim vs. PSP-3000</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Sony officially announced the PSP-3000 at the 2008 Leipzig Games Convention. Improvements over the PSP-2000 included a built in mic and an improved LCD screen. The new screen features twice the color gamut, five times the contrast ratio, and a response time that is twice as fast as the PSP-2000's LCD screen. It also features a new anti-reflective technology for improved viewing of the LCD screen in outdoor areas.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The PSP-3000 was released in Japan, Europe and North America in October.</p><h2>PSPgo</h2><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17415/1041137-psp_go.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1041137" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17415/1041137-psp_go.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1041137"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/17415/1041137-psp_go.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/17415/1041137-psp_go.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>PSP GO in the Flesh</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">During E3 2009, Sony revealed the PSPgo, (or PSP Go) the lightest and most physically compact PSP model. This portability is achieved using a slide-out form factor, a smaller screen (3.8 inch screen as opposed to the 4.3 inches on all other models), and the removal of the UMD drive, limiting the system to digitally downloaded games only. Under the hood, PSPgo is identical to other PSP models, with the same capabilities and OS, while also adding 16GB internal flash memory and PS3 controller support . However, the lack of UMD drive, which physically prevents it from playing disc-based games, resulted in the PSP Go being a complete commercial failure.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The 16GB internal storage space can be expanded by the use of Sony's proprietary M2 Memory Stick, unlike the other models of PSP, which use the Memory Stick ProDUO. The PSPgo existed alongside the PSP-3000 when it launched on October 1st, 2009, and unlike other PSP revisions was not intended by Sony to be a replacement for existing models.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The device proved unpopular with many gamers for various reasons, most notably the fact that PSP game discs could not be played on the PSPgo. Even if you own a game on disc, in order to play it you would have to repurchase and download the game from PSN, often at a marked up price. To make matters worse, certain PSP titles were never made available for digital download at all, making the PSPgo unattractive even to gamers who did not yet own a PSP.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Other issues include the fact that PSN games tend to be overpriced, the slow download speeds on PSP systems in general, new games being listed incorrectly in PSN store, the fact that some games suffering from glitches not found in their UMD counterparts, and poor customer service.</p><h2>PSP-E1000</h2><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11512/2137356-pspe1000.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2137356" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.45486725663717" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:45.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11512/2137356-pspe1000.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2137356"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11512/2137356-pspe1000.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11512/2137356-pspe1000.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>PSP-E1000</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Announced at <a href="/gamescom-2011/3015-7065/" data-ref-id="3015-7065">Gamescom 2011</a>, the PSP-E1000 is a budget-priced PSP available only in PAL territories. Reversing course from the PSPgo, the PSP-E1000 includes a UMD drive, but does not include any network capabilities whatsoever. Slightly larger and heavier than the PSP-3000, the PSP-E1000 has a charcoal black plastic matte body similar to the slim PS3 redesign. The layout is fairly similar to the original PSP, however it moves the system buttons to a single row below the screen which is flush with the case itself. To save on costs, the PSP-E1000 removed WiFi and has only one speaker instead of two. Despite the lack of wireless connectivity, PSN content could still be accessed by connecting the PSP-E1000 to a Playstation 3, or to a PC via USB and using Sony's Media Go software.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The PSP-E100 launched at a cost of €99.99 or £85.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0"> </p><h2>Reception</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Shown off at E3 2004, the portable was highly anticipated and thought of by many at the time to be superior to the <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-ds/3045-52/" data-ref-id="3045-52">Nintendo DS </a>which was launching around the same time.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">However, leadIng up to launch whispers of long load times and a short battery life began appearing online. These criticisms were true and it was something that would haunt the system for a majority of it's life.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Another hamper to the system was a divided perspective of the handheld market. During its first few years, the PSP would often get ports or sequels of console games that many felt were ill-suited for the portable market. By 2006 and continuing into 2007, several of these PSP titles were ported to Playstation 2.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Rampant piracy was also an issue for third parties. The PSP was easily hackable and guides on how to bypass the system's security were easily available on the web. Sony attempted through several firmware updates to make hacking the system more difficult but the wheels were already in motion.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">By mid-2008 the once promising handheld's library looked barren with few games being released apart from ports. Sony would try in 2009 to give the system one last serious push with titles like <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/rock-band-unplugged/3030-25421/" data-ref-id="3030-25421">Rockband Unplugged </a>and <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/motorstorm-arctic-edge/3030-25424/" data-ref-id="3030-25424">Motorstorm Arctic Edge</a> but at that point much of the damage had already been done.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Despite this the PSP is still remembered for its best games and for being the most successful dedicated gaming handheld that wasn't made by Nintendo. The system is also known among gamers for its homebrew scene which Sony desperately tried to put a lid on.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">In Japan, the PSP continued to be phenomenally successful well past the launch date of the Playstation Vita, (the PSP's successor) and even outselling the Nintendo DS and 3DS for a period of time.</p><h2>Launch

Discs' are used by the PSP for games and movies. They are small circular discs in a plastic casing. All PSP models except the PSPgo support this format, and various games include firmware updates for the PSP on their disc.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Some movies available on UMD are now included on Blu-Ray releases. The user can download a PSP version of the film from their PS3 to the PSP or PSPgo. Some examples are Godzilla and The Ugly Truth.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Copies of <a href="/lumines-puzzle-fusion/3030-5057/" data-ref-id="3030-5057">Lumines</a> featured an older firmware update which many users bought and installed to unlock their PSP. At the time this firmware update left the PSP easier to unlock. More recent firmware updates make this harder to do.</p><h2>Media Functionality</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The PSP plays most MP3 and AVC music files. The PSP's video playback options are far more limited, however. The PSP can play movie downloads and rentals from the Playstation Video store, but playing your own movies generally requires a file converter as the PSP does not support the vast majority of movie files.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Videos, games, and music can all be managed on the PSP by connecting it to your PC via a USB cable. Sony also distributes free software named Media Go, which allows users to download PSN content from their PC.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Each PSP requires a Memory Stick Pro Duo, which is a proprietary memory stick format created by Sony. The memory stick is typically sold separately.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0"> </p><h2 style="margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;">Custom Firmware and Homebrew</h2><p style="">The PSP was very well known for it's Custom Firmware scene. By opening up the battery and cutting a part of it, you could install Custom Firmware which allowed users to run unsigned software, which allowed ISOs of PSP games, emulators, and homebrew. It was later made even easier, because by some point you could just do it from files on the Memory Stick. Throughout the PSP's life, Sony tried to put a lid on this and kept updating the firmware, plugging up exploits each time, which made them infamous in the Homebrew scene. Now that the PSP has been discontinued, it's very easy to mod them, even on hardware revisions that were unmoddable during a good portion of their life, including the PSP go.</p><h2>Specifications</h2><table><tbody><tr><td>CPU</td><td>MIPS R4000-based; clocked from 1 to 333 MHz</td></tr><tr><td>Storage Capacity</td><td><b>PSP1000/2000/3000:</b> Memory Stick Duo and Memory Stick PRO Duo (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 or 128 GB)<br /><b>PSPgo:</b> Memory Stick M2</td></tr><tr><td>Memory</td><td>32 MB (1000 model) or 64 MB (2000, 3000, and PSP Go models)</td></tr><tr><td>Display</td><td>480 × 272 pixels with 16.8 million colors, 16:9 widescreen TFT LCD, 3.8 in (97 mm) (PSP GO), 4.3 in (110 mm) (All other models)</td></tr><tr><td>Connectivity</td><td>Wi-Fi (802.11b),IrDA, USB</td></tr><tr><td>Dimensions</td><td><b>PSP1000:</b> 74 mm (2.9 in) (h) 170 mm (6.7 in) (w) 23 mm (0.91 in) (d)<br /><b>PSP2000/3000:</b> 71 mm (2.8 in) (h) 169 mm (6.7 in) (w) 19 mm (0.75 in) (d)<br /><b>PSPgo:</b> 69 mm (2.7 in) (h) 128 mm (5.0 in) (w) 16.5 mm (0.65 in) (d)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td><b>PSP1000:</b> 280 grams (9.9 oz)<br /><b>PSP2000/3000:</b> 189 grams (6.7 oz)<br /><b>PSPgo:</b> 158 grams (5.6 oz)</td></tr></tbody></table>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1490403-playstation_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1490403" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="1.1337868480726" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:113.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1490403-playstation_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1490403"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33529/1490403-playstation_2.jpg"></a><figcaption>The PlayStation 2</figcaption></figure><p style="">The PlayStation 2 was released on March 4th 2000 in Japan, October 26th 2000 in North America, November 24th 2000 in Europe and November 30th 2000 in Australia. At its core, the PlayStation 2 is powered by a 128-bit CPU co-developed with Toshiba known as the "Emotion Engine," the "Graphics Synthesizer" chip, a 24x speed CD-ROM (4x DVD drive, 2 proprietary controller ports, 2 proprietary memory card slots, DEV9 expansion bay for a network adapter, and 2 USB 1.1 ports.</p><p style="">The PS2 initially sold well partly on the basis of the strength of the PlayStation brand and the console's backward compatibility with original PlayStation titles. It sold over 980,000 units by March 5th 2000, one day after launch in Japan. The launch of the PlayStation 2 was not without its setbacks. Manufacturing delays pushed back the original launch day of the PlayStation 2 to fall in North America, and a number of early PlayStation 2 units suffered from disk read errors which subsequently prompted a class action lawsuit against Sony. Sony agreed to provide free repair or replacement for the faulty consoles and continued to do so until February 2005.</p><p style="">At the time, many in the gaming industry predicted a close match up between the PlayStation 2, Microsoft's <a href="/xbox/3045-32/" data-ref-id="3045-32">Xbox</a>, and Nintendo's <a href="/gamecube/3045-23/" data-ref-id="3045-23">GameCube</a>. <a href="/sega/3010-62/" data-ref-id="3010-62">Sega</a>'s <a href="/dreamcast/3045-37/" data-ref-id="3045-37">Dreamcast</a> was released a full 16 months before the PlayStation 2, but failed to gain enough momentum and Sega discontinued the Dreamcast in March of 2001 to turn its attention to software publishing. The prediction, however, was never fulfilled as the release of several blockbuster games during the 2001 holiday season maintained sales momentum and held off the PlayStation 2's rivals.</p><h4>Discontinuation</h4><p style="">On December 28th, 2012, Sony confirmed that the PlayStation 2 console had been discontinued in Japan. A week later, Sony confirmed that manufacture of the console had been discontinued worldwide, marking almost 13 years of production for the console. At 150 million units sold worldwide, it is the best-selling console ever.</p><h2>Launch Titles</h2><h3>Japan - March 4, 2000</h3><ul><li><a href="/a-train-6/3030-19375/" data-ref-id="3030-19375">A-Train 6</a></li><li><a href="/drummania/3030-23011/" data-ref-id="3030-23011">DrumMania</a></li><li><a href="/eternal-ring/3030-18651/" data-ref-id="3030-18651">Eternal Ring</a></li><li>Kakinoki Shogi IV</li><li><a href="/kessen/3030-11047/" data-ref-id="3030-11047">Kessen</a></li><li>Morita Shogi</li><li><a href="/ridge-racer-v/3030-7019/" data-ref-id="3030-7019">Ridge Racer V</a></li><li><a href="/stepping-selection/3030-30889/" data-ref-id="3030-30889">Stepping Selection</a></li><li><a href="/street-fighter-ex3/3030-10989/" data-ref-id="3030-10989">Street Fighter EX3</a></li></ul><h3>North America - October 26, 2000</h3><ul><li><a href="/armored-core-2/3030-20039/" data-ref-id="3030-20039">Armored Core 2</a></li><li><a href="/dead-or-alive-2-hardcore/3030-22292/" data-ref-id="3030-22292">Dead or Alive 2: Hardcore</a></li><li><a href="/dynasty-warriors-2/3030-15413/" data-ref-id="3030-15413">Dynasty Warriors 2</a></li><li><a href="/espn-international-track-field/3030-3602/" data-ref-id="3030-3602">ESPN International Track and Field</a></li><li><a href="/espn-winter-x-games-snowboarding/3030-21938/" data-ref-id="3030-21938">ESPN X-Games Snowboarding</a></li><li><a href="/eternal-ring/3030-18651/" data-ref-id="3030-18651">Eternal Ring</a></li><li><a href="/evergrace/3030-11960/" data-ref-id="3030-11960">Evergrace</a></li><li><a href="/fantavision/3030-361/" data-ref-id="3030-361">Fantavision</a></li><li><a href="/gungriffon-blaze/3030-6186/" data-ref-id="3030-6186">Gungriffon Blaze</a></li><li><a href="/kessen/3030-11047/" data-ref-id="3030-11047">Kessen</a></li><li><a href="/madden-nfl-2001/3030-8822/" data-ref-id="3030-8822">Madden NFL 2001</a></li><li><a href="/midnight-club-street-racing/3030-10124/" data-ref-id="3030-10124">Midnight Club</a></li><li><a href="/motogp/3030-7808/" data-ref-id="3030-7808">Moto GP</a></li><li><a href="/nhl-2001/3030-14995/" data-ref-id="3030-14995">NHL 2001</a></li><li><a href="/orphen-scion-of-sorcery/3030-11618/" data-ref-id="3030-11618">Orphen</a></li><li><a href="/q-ball-billiards-master/3030-4945/" data-ref-id="3030-4945">Q-Ball Billiards Master</a></li><li><a href="/ready-2-rumble-boxing-round-2/3030-11649/" data-ref-id="3030-11649">Ready 2 Rumble Boxing Round 2</a></li><li><a href="/ridge-racer-v/3030-7019/" data-ref-id="3030-7019">Ridge Racer V</a></li><li><a href="/silent-scope/3030-9780/" data-ref-id="3030-9780">Silent Scope</a></li><li><a href="/smugglers-run/3030-20406/" data-ref-id="3030-20406">Smuggler's Run</a></li><li><a href="/ssx/3030-1932/" data-ref-id="3030-1932">SSX</a></li><li><a href="/street-fighter-ex3/3030-10989/" data-ref-id="3030-10989">Street Fighter EX3</a></li><li><a href="/summoner/3030-19848/" data-ref-id="3030-19848">Summoner</a></li><li><a href="/swing-away-golf/3030-2670/" data-ref-id="3030-2670">Swing Away Golf</a></li><li><a href="/tekken-tag-tournament/3030-10162/" data-ref-id="3030-10162">Tekken TAG Tournament</a></li><li><a href="/timesplitters/3030-12621/" data-ref-id="3030-12621">TimeSplitters</a></li><li><a href="/unreal-tournament/3030-17448/" data-ref-id="3030-17448">Unreal Tournament</a></li><li><a href="/wild-wild-racing/3030-12839/" data-ref-id="3030-12839">Wild Wild Racing</a></li><li><a href="/x-squad/3030-11151/" data-ref-id="3030-11151">X-Squad</a></li></ul><h3>Europe - November 24, 2000</h3><ul><li><a href="/aqua-aqua/3030-3026/" data-ref-id="3030-3026">Aqua Aqua</a></li><li><a href="/bust-a-move-4/3030-1263/" data-ref-id="3030-1263">Bust A Move 4</a></li><li><a href="/disneys-donald-duck-goin-quackers/3030-9551/" data-ref-id="3030-9551">Donald Duck Quack Attack</a></li><li><a href="/espn-international-track-field/3030-3602/" data-ref-id="3030-3602">ESPN International Track and Field</a></li><li><a href="/espn-winter-x-games-snowboarding/3030-21938/" data-ref-id="3030-21938">ESPN X-Games Snowboarding</a></li><li><a href="/f1-racing-championship/3030-14287/" data-ref-id="3030-14287">F1 Racing Championship</a></li><li><a href="/fantavision/3030-361/" data-ref-id="3030-361">Fantavision</a></li><li><a href="/fifa-2001/3030-14647/" data-ref-id="3030-14647">FIFA 2001</a></li><li><a href="/gradius-iii-and-iv/3030-676/" data-ref-id="3030-676">Gradius III &amp;

In 2002 however, Sony began advertising heavily on several online first party titles, such as <a href="/socom-us-navy-seals/3030-6246/" data-ref-id="3030-6246">SOCOM: US Navy Seals</a>, to compete with Microsoft. Although late, and despite the fact that Sony required developers pick up the responsibility of providing servers, online gaming was one of the major selling points of the PlayStation 2. The original PlayStation 2 consoles did not have an integrated network adapter, requiring the user to purchase the unit separately. The launch of the PlayStation 2 Slim model saw the network adapter built into the console.</p><h2>PlayStation 2 Slim</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/909758-image.php.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-909758" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="1" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/909758-image.php.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-909758"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/30036/909758-image.php.jpg"></a><figcaption>PS2 Slim</figcaption></figure><p style="">In September 2004, in time for the launch of <a href="/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas/3030-7120/" data-ref-id="3030-7120">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</a>, Sony unveiled its major hardware revision: a smaller, thinner and quieter PlayStation 2 that included a built-in Ethernet port. It didn't contain the 3.5" expansion bay, removing support for the internal hard disk drive. Similar to the <a href="/gamecube/3045-23/" data-ref-id="3045-23">GameCube</a>, early models lacked an internal power supply, and had a modified multi-tap expansion. Current PlayStation 2 Slims no longer require an external power supply. The removal of the expansion bay has been criticized as a limitation due to the existence of titles such as <a href="/final-fantasy-xi-online/3030-11142/" data-ref-id="3030-11142">Final Fantasy XI</a>, which require the use of the HDD. The PlayStation 2 Slim model was first released in black, however today the slimline model can be found in silver, white, and pink in North America.</p><h2>PSX</h2><p style="">The Sony PSX (not to be confused with the PlayStation) is a consumer device that can be used as a digital video recorder, DVD burner, and PS2 game player. It also had built in video, photo, and audio editing software. The device, which has only released in Japan, was poorly received, with some major features absent from the first revisions of the hardware. Despite major price drops on the device, sales were very weak in Japan. It is still notable for introduction of the popular XMB interface, now used in Sony's PSP, PlayStation 3, and Bravia TVs.</p><h2>Accessories and Peripherals</h2><table><tbody><tr><td><h3>DualShock 2</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14741/970716-dualshock2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-970716" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.67068273092369" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:67.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14741/970716-dualshock2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-970716"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14741/970716-dualshock2.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14741/970716-dualshock2.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>DualShock 2</figcaption></figure> The <a href="../../dualshock-2/59-30/" rel="nofollow">DualShock 2</a> is the standard controller which comes packaged with the PS2. Visually, it was practically identical to the original DualShock, with the main distinction being its black color. The controller included rumble and all the same buttons as its predecessor, but it was lighter, had more accurate analog movement, and featured pressure sensitive buttons. The DualShock 2 is regarded as one of the best controllers ever made, despite some criticisms of parallel analog sticks, shallow buttons, and questionable ergonomics.</td></tr><tr><td><h3>EyeToy</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3766/560739-eyetoy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-560739" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="1.0531561461794" data-width="301" style="width: 301px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:105.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3766/560739-eyetoy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-560739"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3766/560739-eyetoy.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3766/560739-eyetoy.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>EyeToy Camera</figcaption></figure> One of the most well known of all the PS2's peripherals is the EyeToy. It was a USB vision camera which took images of what the player was doing and relayed it back into games so the player could interact with games using motion. The camera was mainly used with the nine games of the <a href="../../eyetoy/62-178/" rel="nofollow">EyeToy</a> franchise but also with other games which used the device's capabilities such as Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME, although the EyeToy isn't integral to the gameplay experience in most of these games. The camera has serious limitation; it has roughly 1.3 megapixels, and needed a lot of light in the playing area. A red LED turns on when EyeToy doesn't have enough light to distinguish the player from the background.</td></tr><tr><td><h3>PS2 HDD</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14741/1125682-800px_playstation_bb_unit.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1125682" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14741/1125682-800px_playstation_bb_unit.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1125682"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14741/1125682-800px_playstation_bb_unit.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14741/1125682-800px_playstation_bb_unit.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>PS2 HDD</figcaption></figure> Released in North America and Japan, the PlayStation 2 Hard Drive Disk allowed for the storage of up to 40GB.

Few North American games had HDD support, and the only game which actually needed the drive was <a href="../../final-fantasy-xi-online/61-11142/" rel="nofollow">Final Fantasy XI</a>, as it was used to store patches and other game updates. In 2004, the device stopped receiving support from Sony. The Slimline model can't use the HDD without a 3rd party cable.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Best Selling Games</h2><ul><li><a href="/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas/3030-7120/" data-ref-id="3030-7120">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</a> - 17.33 Million</li><li><a href="/gran-turismo-3-a-spec/3030-12950/" data-ref-id="3030-12950">Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec</a> - 14.89 Million</li><li><a href="/gran-turismo-4/3030-17784/" data-ref-id="3030-17784">Gran Turismo 4</a> - 10.76 Million</li><li><a href="/grand-theft-auto-vice-city/3030-17036/" data-ref-id="3030-17036">Grand Theft Auto: Vice City</a> - 9.61 Million</li><li><a href="/grand-theft-auto-iii/3030-3724/" data-ref-id="3030-3724">Grand Theft Auto III</a> - 7.9 Million</li><li><a href="/metal-gear-solid-2-sons-of-liberty/3030-12388/" data-ref-id="3030-12388">Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</a> - 7 Million</li><li><a href="/final-fantasy-x/3030-11237/" data-ref-id="3030-11237">Final Fantasy X</a> - 6.6 Million</li><li><a href="/kingdom-hearts/3030-10983/" data-ref-id="3030-10983">Kingdom Hearts</a> - 5.9 Million Shipped</li><li><a href="/final-fantasy-xii/3030-11497/" data-ref-id="3030-11497">Final Fantasy XII</a> - 5.2 Million Shipped</li><li><a href="/dragon-quest-viii-journey-of-the-cursed-king/3030-3579/" data-ref-id="3030-3579">Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King</a> - 4.78 Million Shipped</li></ul><h2>Hardware Specifications</h2><h3>General</h3><ul><li><b>CPU</b>: 128 Bit "Emotion Engine"</li><li><b>System Clock</b>: 300 MHz</li><li><b>System Memory</b>: 32 MB Direct Rambus</li><li><b>Memory Bus Bandwidth</b>: 3.2 GB per second</li><li><b>Co-Processor</b>: FPU (Floating Point Multiply Accumulator x 1, Floating Point Divider x 1)</li><li><b>Vector Units</b>: VU0 and VU1 (Floating Point Multiply Accumulator x 9, Floating Point Divider x 1)</li><li><b>Floating Point Performance</b>: 6.2 GFLOPS</li><li><b>Compressed Image Decoder</b>: MPEG2</li></ul><h3>Audio</h3><ul><li><b>Number of voices</b>: ADPCM: 48 channel on SPU2 plus definable by software</li><li><b>Sampling Frequency</b>: 44.1 KHz or 48 KHz (selectable)</li></ul><h3>I/O</h3><ul><li><b>CPU Core</b>: Current PlayStation CPU</li><li><b>Clock Frequency</b>: 33.8 MHz or 37.5 MHz (selectable)</li><li><b>Sub Bus</b>: 32 Bit</li><li><b>Interface Types</b>: IEEE1394, Universal Serial Bus (USB)</li><li><b>Communication</b>: via PC-Card PCMCIA</li><li><b>Disc Media</b>: DVD-ROM (CD-ROM compatible)</li></ul><h3>Graphics</h3><ul><li><b>Clock Frequency</b>: 150MHz</li><li><b>DRAM Bus bandwidth</b>: 48 GB Per Second</li><li><b>DRAM Bus width</b>: 2560 bits</li><li><b>Pixel Configuration</b>: RGB:Alpha:Z Buffer (24:8:32)</li><li><b>Maximum Polygon Rate</b>: 75 Million Polygons Per Second (Theoretical Peak)</li><li><b>3D CG Geometric Transformation</b>: 66 million Polygons Per Second (Theoretical Peak)</li></ul><p style=""> </p>]]></description>

Unlike many of the special edition Xbox 360 bundles, this one does not feature any unique artwork or designs on any of the included hardware. It retailed for $399.99 US.</p><h2>Games</h2><p style="">The Xbox 360 has a large array of games starting in November 2005. On launch, Microsoft's first party titles included <a href="/perfect-dark-zero/3030-14558/" data-ref-id="3030-14558">Perfect Dark Zero</a>, <a href="/kameo-elements-of-power/3030-19228/" data-ref-id="3030-19228">Kameo: Elements of Power</a>, and <a href="/project-gotham-racing-3/3030-19809/" data-ref-id="3030-19809">PGR 3</a>. Activision's <a href="/call-of-duty-2/3030-2347/" data-ref-id="3030-2347">Call of Duty 2</a> introduces console gamers to the series and became the biggest game on Xbox Live during launch. Later in 2006, Epic Games released <a href="/gears-of-war-2/3030-20662/" data-ref-id="3030-20662">Gears of War</a>, what was considered to be the "killer app" of the Xbox 360. Thanks to the game's impressive graphics and multiplayer, the game became a big hit. 2007 would follow many games like <a href="/halo-3/3030-9993/" data-ref-id="3030-9993">Halo 3</a> (one of the most hyped games of the year), <a href="/mass-effect/3030-16909/" data-ref-id="3030-16909">Mass Effect</a>, and <a href="/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare/3030-2133/" data-ref-id="3030-2133">Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</a>, which broke many records on Xbox Live when it was released, with its <a href="/modern-warfare-2/3030-24713/" data-ref-id="3030-24713">sequel</a> surpassing it. Many other sequels would be released including <a href="/fable-ii/3030-20514/" data-ref-id="3030-20514">Fable 2</a> and <a href="/banjo-kazooie-nuts-bolts/3030-20586/" data-ref-id="3030-20586">Banjo Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts</a> within the later years.</p><p style="">One key feature to Xbox Live's success is the Xbox Live Arcade games. On launch, the 360 Premium bundle came packaged with<a href="/hexic/3030-18287/" data-ref-id="3030-18287"> Hexic HD</a>, a puzzle game created by <a href="/tetris/3025-291/" data-ref-id="3025-291">Tetris</a> creator <a href="/alexey-pajitnov/3040-9332/" data-ref-id="3040-9332">Alexey Pajitnov</a>. Other launch titles include<a href="/geometry-wars-retro-evolved/3030-11099/" data-ref-id="3030-11099"> Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved</a> and<a href="/marble-blast-ultra/3030-8047/" data-ref-id="3030-8047"> Marble Blast Ultra</a>. In the beginning, Microsoft restricted Arcade game sizes to no more than 50 MB big due to the Core model and its memory card. Later, when the 256 MB memory card was released, the game size limit was expanded. Today you're able to get full games online and games can be installed to your hard drive.</p><h3>Compatibility with original Xbox Games</h3><p style="">By and large the Xbox 360 is not compatible with original Xbox games out of the box. Instead Microsoft provided software emulation for selected titles. The emulation is based on games with similar architecture to each other. This means that from a distance the list of compatible titles may look strange with such inclusions as <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/barbie-horse-adventure-wild-horse-rescue/3030-7844/" data-ref-id="3030-7844">Barbie's Horse Adventure</a> while many best selling or critically acclaimed titles are seemingly ignored.</p><p style="">The emulation is not perfect and in a lot of case games feature glitches that were not present in the original version. Glitches can go from minor (slowdown, framerate issues) to sever (some glitches cause games to full on crash) Thirteen games were pulled from the service presumable due to such issue. (Seven of which were later reinstated)</p><p style="">Microsoft stopped updating the Xbox emulator in 2007. According to Wikipedia the final total of backwards compatible titles is 476 title making up approximately half of all Xbox games..</p><p style=""> </p><h2>New Xbox Experience (NXE)</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1694/365903-360_dashboard.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-365903" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.61888111888112" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:61.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1694/365903-360_dashboard.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-365903"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1694/365903-360_dashboard.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1694/365903-360_dashboard.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The old Xbox 360 Dashboard</figcaption></figure><p style="">Since launch the main way of interacting with the Xbox 360 has been using the 'Dashboard', a menu system split into sections by 'Blades'; initially the 'Dashboard' consisted of four 'Blades:' Live, Games, Media and Settings; a blade was later added which separated the Xbox Live Marketplace from the Xbox Live 'Blade'.

The most common hardware failure is the General Hardware Failure, denoted by the bottom two and upper right quadrant of the Ring of Light flashing red; leading to the failure being dubbed the ' <a href="/red-ring-of-death/3015-290/" data-ref-id="3015-290">Red Ring of Death</a>'. This failure renders the console unable to boot or 'bricked' and the only official course of action for the consumer being to call Xbox support to ship the console back to Microsoft where it is either repaired or replaced. While there is no official course of action on fixing the Red Ring of Death there are some unofficial solutions to try. The most popular is called the "towel trick" in which you take everything off of your Xbox 360, your hard-drive, A/V cables, etc. The only thing you want plugged in is the power supply. Now you wrap it in three (3) large towels (the ones you would use to dry yourself off after a shower) and turn it on. Let it sit running for 20-30 minutes, turn it off, and let it cool off for another 15. Then turn it on and it should work. *Note this is not a permanent solution.*</p><p style="">No official reason has been given by Microsoft as to why this error is so common place, however most speculation points towards insufficient cooling around the GPU leading to a warping of the motherboard. Microsoft has taken steps to solve this problem by adding an additional heat sink to the GPU in later units and units returned from repair. These changes were included in a chipset refresh codenamed 'Falcon' which also includes a 65nm CPU to further reduce heat. An as yet unreleased chip set refresh, codenamed 'Jasper,' will introduce a 65nm GPU and is hoped to solve the 'Red Ring of Death' problem.</p><p style="">As well as these hardware revisions Microsoft has increased the Xbox 360 warranty to 3 years, however this is only to cover the 'Red Ring of Death' all other hardware problems are only covered for 1 year; this was reported to have cost Microsoft $1 billion.</p><p style=""><i>Note</i>: the new "XBOX 360 'S'" does not feature the red LEDs behind the power button. Microsoft removed this particular error message because of the bad connotations associated with this.</p><h3>DVD Drive Problems</h3><p style="">The DVD Drive is often the target of criticism, mostly for the excessive noise produced and an apparent tendency for scratching discs. These issues are less apparent in later models of the 360 as Microsoft have replaced the initial DVD drive with a quieter model from BenQ.</p><h3>Power Adapter Size</h3><p style="">The Xbox 360's power adapter is significantly larger than similar adapters on previous consoles. This criticism was mostly vocal at the beginning of the Xbox 360's retail life, as Microsoft has reduced the power adapter's size over the life of the console.</p><h3>Xbox Live Arcade File Size Restriction</h3><p style="">Initially Xbox Live Arcade games had to come in under the 50 MB file size restriction. While many people felt that that 50MB was too small to create games this limitation allowed 360 owners without the hard drive to enjoy all of the content of XBLA at that time. Over time Microsoft has relaxed restrictions to coincide with the release of larger memory units. Currently the size limit is 2GB and this is a limitation of the backend of service itself rather than an arbitrary limit imposed by Microsoft.</p>]]></description>

It was first released in Japan on July 15, 1983. Three launch titles were available: <a href="/donkey-kong/3030-311/" data-ref-id="3030-311">Donkey Kong</a>, <a href="/donkey-kong-jr/3030-19416/" data-ref-id="3030-19416">Donkey Kong Jr.</a>, and <a href="/popeye/3030-14419/" data-ref-id="3030-14419">Popeye</a>. At first, the console was prone to crashes (due to a bad chip set). After a re-release with a new motherboard, the Famicom became incredibly popular.</p><p style="">In an effort to enter the North American market, Nintendo negotiated with Atari to release the Famicom as the Nintendo Advanced Video Gaming System, but the deal didn't get off the ground. In June of 1985, Nintendo unveiled the North American version of the Famicom; the NES. On October 18, 1985, the NES was released, along with eighteen launch titles. Two boxed sets were released, the Deluxe Set (console, <a href="/rob/3005-1707/" data-ref-id="3005-1707">R.O.B</a>., <a href="/light-gun/3015-2354/" data-ref-id="3015-2354">Zapper</a>, two controllers, <a href="/duck-hunt/3030-2758/" data-ref-id="3030-2758">Duck Hunt</a>, and <a href="/gyromite/3030-20055/" data-ref-id="3030-20055">Gyromite</a>) and the Control Deck (console, two controllers and <a href="/super-mario-bros/3030-15544/" data-ref-id="3030-15544">Super Mario Bros.</a>).</p><p style="">Nintendo had a hard time getting the NES sold, because most consumers thought video games were over with. They realized this and started marketing the NES as a toy instead of a video game. They packed in a light gun and a robot with the console and people started to pay attention. In December of 1985 Nintendo went to toy stores around New York City to try and sell the NES and said if the consoles don't sell they will buy them back. This gave Nintendo a foothold but they still needed to get the NES into the hands of more people.</p><p style="">They contacted Worlds of Wonder, a toy company who made the two most popular toys in 1985, Lazer Tag and Teddy Ruxpin, and said if they can get Nintendo into the big department stores their toys are in they can have a percentage of Nintendo's sales. Worlds of Wonder agreed to this deal, so whenever a store called and wanted to order a toy, they would require that store to order 500 NES consoles. This is how Nintendo first got into the American market.</p><p style="">The NES was an enormous success in Japan and North America, dominating the competition in both regions. In comparison to its considerable success in Japan and North America, however, the NES had much less success in Europe and <a href="/south-america/3035-2906/" data-ref-id="3035-2906">South America</a>, with <a title="Sega" href="/sega/3010-62/" data-ref-id="3010-62">Sega</a>'s <a title="Sega Master System" href="/sega-master-system/3045-8/" data-ref-id="3045-8">Master System</a> being significantly more successful than the NES in these regions.

Nintendo had a veritable monopoly on the market at the time, so they encouraged developers to make games for their console. But, developers had to sign a contract stating they would only develop games for the NES. Also, a chip was instituted into the NES called the 10NES. If this same chip was not found in the cartridge, the game wouldn't load. Eventually, however, these business practices were ultimately outlawed.</p><p style="">Despite Nintendo's efforts, unlicensed games were still created for the system. Designers found ways to bypass the 10NES chip. One such way was to short circuit the chip, temporarily ceasing its function. However, <a href="/atari-games-corporation/3010-794/" data-ref-id="3010-794">Atari Games</a> created unlicensed software for the NES under the name <a href="/tengen/3010-752/" data-ref-id="3010-752">Tengen</a>. Tengen didn't want to be held liable for short-circuiting and possibly damaging the NES, so they devised a chip (nicknamed Rabbit) that disabled the 10NES chip.

Known as the top-loader, this version is nearly identical to the original model, but it has several key differences. The main difference, and the reason for its nickname, is the fact that cartridges are loaded into a slot on the top of the console, rather than through a tray at the front. It also sported a different color scheme and controllers, a redesigned logo, and modified circuit boards to improve the video output. NES-101 was known as HVC-101 in Japan, and was released on December 1, 1993.</p><h2>Accessories</h2><table><tbody><tr><th>Nintendo Zapper</th></tr><tr><td>The Zapper was a light gun that came bundled with the NES later on in its life span.

The Dendy differs slightly from the NES in terms of hardware, containing a slightly different chipset. There were several variations of the Dendy, such as Dendy Classic and Dendy Junior. Cartridges were typically bootleg versions of official games, or even compilations, and were similar in appearance to the Famicom cartridges.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<h2 style="margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;">Overview</h2><p style="">The Sony PlayStation (common abbreviations are PS, PS1, PSone, and PSX) is a video game console that was released by <a href="/sony-computer-entertainment-america/3010-313/" data-ref-id="3010-313">Sony Computer Entertainment</a>, in <a href="/japan/3035-37/" data-ref-id="3035-37">Japan</a> on December 3, 1994, and in <a href="/north-america/3035-1664/" data-ref-id="3035-1664">North America</a> on September 9, 1995. The PlayStation was the first of <a href="/sony-computer-entertainment-incorporated/3010-995/" data-ref-id="3010-995">Sony Computer Entertainment's</a> game consoles. The Playstation was the predecessor to the <a href="/playstation-2/3045-19/" data-ref-id="3045-19">PlayStation 2</a>, <a href="/psp/3045-18/" data-ref-id="3045-18">PlayStation Portable</a>, <a href="/playstation-3/3045-35/" data-ref-id="3045-35">PlayStation 3</a>, <a href="/playstation-vita/3045-129/" data-ref-id="3045-129">Playstation Vita, </a>and most recently the <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/" data-ref-id="3045-146">PlayStation 4</a>, which was released in 2013.</p><h2>Development</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13158/960638-gb.png" data-ref-id="1300-960638" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="360" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 360px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13158/960638-gb.png" data-ref-id="1300-960638"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/13158/960638-gb.png"></a></figure><p style="">The development of the PlayStation actually began before the 16-bit era. At that time, <a href="/nintendo/3010-90/" data-ref-id="3010-90">Nintendo</a> wanted to experiment with the CD-ROM media for use on the <a href="/nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-21/" data-ref-id="3045-21">Famicom</a> (following the success of <a href="/nec-home-electronics-ltd/3010-2708/" data-ref-id="3010-2708">NEC</a>'s <a href="/turbografx-16/3045-55/" data-ref-id="3045-55">PC Engine</a> <a href="/turbografx-cd/3045-53/" data-ref-id="3045-53">CD-ROM²</a> in Japan), but encountered a few problems. Nintendo finally decided to work with <a href="/sony-corporation/3010-3223/" data-ref-id="3010-3223">Sony</a>, one of the creators of the CD-ROM format (with Phillips) to produce a CD add-on to the <a href="/snes/3045-9/" data-ref-id="3045-9">Super Nintendo</a>, named the SNES-CD. A contract was signed in 1988, and Sony began work on the product. Initially, the partnership was supposed to be announced at CES 1991, but while reviewing the first contract, <a href="/hiroshi-yamauchi/3040-615/" data-ref-id="3040-615">Hiroshi Yamauchi</a> found out that Sony would entirely handle every title release on the console. <a href="/nintendo/3010-90/" data-ref-id="3010-90">Nintendo</a> then secretly cancelled the deal. At CES 1991, shortly after Sony announced their "<a href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1243&amp;dat=19910602&amp;id=MQIrAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=joYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7064,6792388" rel="nofollow">Play Station</a>" add-on for the SNES, Nintendo <a href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19910625&amp;id=G6AaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bSwEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2823,1014416" rel="nofollow">announced</a> its cancellation and that they were working to bring Nintendo franchises on Phillips’ own console, the <a href="/cd-i/3045-27/" data-ref-id="3045-27">CD-i</a>. This proved to be a bad decision on Nintendo's part as every game that used those properties were poorly received by both gamers and critics.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/16944/1238417-ken_kutaragi.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1238417" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.2313253012048" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:123.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/16944/1238417-ken_kutaragi.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1238417"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/16944/1238417-ken_kutaragi.jpg"></a><figcaption>Ken Kutaragi</figcaption></figure><p style=""><a href="/ken-kutaragi/3040-48015/" data-ref-id="3040-48015">Ken Kutaragi</a>, president of Sony later dubbed the “The Father of the PlayStation,” was angered by the turn of events. He even declared that they would bury Nintendo. After this, Sony considered abandoning the whole project, which would have lost millions of dollars. Instead, they decided to take everything they learned while developing the console to create their own stand-alone video game system. In 1992, Sony signed a deal that would allow their new console to still be able to play SNES games, with Nintendo maintaining the rights to the game. However, Sony decided to abandon this idea and began reworking their concept for a video game system. They now were aiming for the next-generation of consoles, making the contract they signed with Nintendo irrelevant. Nintendo tried to prevent the release of the PlayStation with a lawsuit in 1991, claiming they essentially owned the name, but this tactic did not work.</p><p style="">The PlayStation was originally intended to be a mainly <a href="/2d/3015-1427/" data-ref-id="3015-1427">2D</a>-focused system. However, after Sony designers saw the huge success of <a href="/sega/3010-62/" data-ref-id="3010-62">Sega</a>'s <a href="/virtua-fighter/3030-15584/" data-ref-id="3030-15584">Virtua Fighter</a> (developed by <a href="/yu-suzuki/3040-15149/" data-ref-id="3040-15149">Yu Suzuki</a> and his Sega <a href="/sega-am2/3010-81/" data-ref-id="3010-81">AM2</a> team) at Japanese <a href="/arcade/3045-84/" data-ref-id="3045-84">arcades</a> in 1993, they decided to make the PlayStation a mainly <a href="/polygonal-3d/3015-1430/" data-ref-id="3015-1430">3D</a>-focused system (see <a href="http://www.wired.com/2012/09/how-virtua-fighter-saved-playstations-bacon/" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">here</a> for more details).</p><p style="">The final version of the PlayStation took about 6 months to develop. Selling the console to publishers and developers was not an easy task for two reasons. One, Sony had to contend with the success of Nintendo and Sega at that time. Two, the PlayStation was a CD-based video game system, and so far none of them had been successful outside of Japan. Yet, when Sony showed them tech demos of the 3D capabilities of the system, gaming publishers and developers were sold on the console. At <a href="/e3-1995/3015-3482/" data-ref-id="3015-3482">E3 1995</a>, the first Electronic Entertainment Expo, Sony announced the price point of $299.</p><h2>Launch</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/1426394-system.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1426394" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.0841487279843" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:108.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/1426394-system.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1426394"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/1426394-system.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/1426394-system.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>PS Launch Packaging</figcaption></figure><p style="">The console was first released in Japan, on December 3rd 1994, over 9 months before it would appear officially in the west.

A platform exclusive title, that would take center stage in securing the 'cool' image of the Playstation brand.</p><p style="">The PlayStation had an interesting pre-order plan; people who reserved the console before its release would receive a compact disc which could be played in any standard Audio-CD player. When the consumer received their PlayStation, putting the compact disc in the console would reveal it was a demo disc; the first in a very long line. While the launch line-up for the PlayStation wasn’t the strongest ever, the following month would prove to be very important with the release of big titles, such as <a href="/warhawk/3030-17169/" data-ref-id="3030-17169">Warhawk</a>, <a href="/twisted-metal/3030-12318/" data-ref-id="3030-12318">Twisted Metal</a>, and of course, <a href="/tekken/3030-10081/" data-ref-id="3030-10081">Tekken</a>.</p><h2>History</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/16944/1228002-bernie.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1228002" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.3017543859649" data-width="285" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 285px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:130.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/16944/1228002-bernie.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1228002"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/16944/1228002-bernie.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/16944/1228002-bernie.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Bernie Stolar</figcaption></figure><p style="">Before the system was launched, <a href="/bernard-stolar/3040-33719/" data-ref-id="3040-33719">Bernard “Bernie” Stolar</a> was made the first executive vice-president of <a href="/sony-computer-entertainment-america/3010-313/" data-ref-id="3010-313">SCEA</a>. With him, he installed policies for games that were eligible release to the PlayStation in North America: 2D games and RPGs were not allowed. Stolar felt that 2-dimensonal games should be excluded because the console was made especially for 3D gaming, and because of the 16-bit was near its end and 2D gaming was heavily associated with it. Stolar felt that RPGs should not be released in the US because the US audience did not enjoy that type of game, and sales in North America proved this. Stolar would leave SCEA after the first holiday of the system's existence. He moved to <a href="/sega/3010-62/" data-ref-id="3010-62">Sega</a> and began work on its new-console, the <a href="/saturn/3045-42/" data-ref-id="3045-42">Saturn</a>, with those same policies.

When Nintendo released the <a href="/nintendo-64/3045-43/" data-ref-id="3045-43">Nintendo 64</a>, Square was skeptical of its cartridge system; cartridges cost more to produce and had less storage space than a CD-Rom. Considering the costs of their new project, Square had to make a hard decision and announced on January 12th, 1996 that they would only develop for Sony consoles from now on. This policy remained in place until the release of <a href="/final-fantasy-crystal-chronicles/3030-15672/" data-ref-id="3030-15672">Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles</a>, in 2003.

In fact, the PlayStation became the first video game console to ship 100 million units worldwide. The system was finally discontinued on March 23rd 2006, more than ten years after its launch. In the end, the PlayStation sold 102 million units, with 28 million being from the PSone redesign; thus, judging by sales and units sold, it clearly “won” the fifth generation of video game consoles.</p><p style="">Eventually the PSone received a LCD screen add-on, which made the system semi-portable.</p><h2>Controller</h2><h3>Original Controller</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8620/281217-playstation_controller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-281217" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.69666666666667" data-width="300" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 300px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:69.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8620/281217-playstation_controller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-281217"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8620/281217-playstation_controller.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8620/281217-playstation_controller.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Original Controller</figcaption></figure><p style="">The PlayStation controller was the most symmetrical of the game controllers at the time of its release and it still is in the current generation of game consoles.

The GameCube was released in Japan on September 14, 2001, in North America on November 18, 2001, in Europe on May 3, 2002, and in Australia on May 17, 2002.</p><p style="">The GameCube sold a total of 21.74 million units worldwide, coming in third place in the so-called "console war" slightly behind <a href="/microsoft-game-studios/3010-340/" data-ref-id="3010-340">Microsoft</a>'s <a href="/xbox/3045-32/" data-ref-id="3045-32">Xbox</a>, but far behind <a href="/sony-corporation/3010-3223/" data-ref-id="3010-3223">Sony</a>'s <a href="/playstation-2/3045-19/" data-ref-id="3045-19">PlayStation 2</a>. The console is officially abbreviated to the acronym "GCN" ("<b>G</b>ame<b>C</b>ube by <b>N</b>intendo").</p><p style="">A version of the GameCube with DVD playback capability was released by <a href="/panasonic-interactive-media/3010-1546/" data-ref-id="3010-1546">Panasonic</a>, but the "Panasonic Q Edition" GameCubes weren't available outside of Japan.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12813/856056-panasonic_q.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-856056" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12813/856056-panasonic_q.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-856056"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/12813/856056-panasonic_q.jpg"></a><figcaption>The Panasonic Q Gamecube was released only in Japan.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The GameCube also saw a fair share of games, although its most popular games were first-party; <a href="/super-mario-sunshine/3030-6649/" data-ref-id="3030-6649">Super Mario Sunshine</a>, <a href="/the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker/3030-18508/" data-ref-id="3030-18508">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a>, <a href="/metroid-prime/3030-15473/" data-ref-id="3030-15473">Metroid Prime</a>, <a href="/f-zero-gx/3030-20448/" data-ref-id="3030-20448">F-Zero GX</a>, and <a href="/animal-crossing/3030-12893/" data-ref-id="3030-12893">Animal Crossing</a>, to name a few. Games released only on the GameCube at the time of release have a triangle in the upper left corner that says "Only For," implicating that the game was only available on the GameCube. The final "major release" on the GameCube was also first-party, with <a href="/the-legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess/3030-19467/" data-ref-id="3030-19467">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a> being one of the most highly-anticipated titles in the console's run, though it is more well known for the version that was ported to the Wii.</p><p style="">As games were no longer on cartridges Nintendo released a series of memory cards where players would save their progress. Memory cards are available in 59 block (of which several were packaged with games including Animal Crossing), a 256 block, and a 1024 block versions.</p><h3>Marketing</h3><p style="">The first advertising campaign for the Nintendo GameCube was simply a rotating cube that would morph into the GameCube logo. A voice would then whisper, "GameCube." This was usually shown at the end of a commercial for a GameCube game.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1844595-download.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-1844595" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1844595-download.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-1844595"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1844595-download.jpeg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1844595-download.jpeg"></noscript></a><figcaption>A wallpaper for the "Who Are You?" campaign.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Another well known advertising campaign was the "Who Are You?" advertising campaign. This was used to market a wide variety of Nintendo games. The "Who Are You?" logo was graffiti lettering. Most of the commercials and print ads were games developed or published by Nintendo, but some third-party developers were able to use the campaign as well. The idea behind the campaign was that players were the character that they played, with print ads showing pieces of the main character taped onto a photograph of a person (e.g. the helmet of Samus Aran taped onto a ballerina to promote Metroid Prime).</p><p style="">There was a distinct difference in the way Nintendo of Japan marketed the GameCube and how it was marketed in western markets. Although in western markets, the GameCube was advertised as a console for experienced gamers; in Japan, it was marketed to appeal to younger and newer players, as a way of gaining back the child audience they lost to their competitors in the previous console cycle. However, it failed, and the GameCube was a commercial flop in Japan. However, due to being marketed to a different audience outside Japan, the GameCube became a very successful console in other countries.</p><h2>Hardware</h2><p style="">Due to pressures from developers, the GameCube was <a href="/nintendo/3010-90/" data-ref-id="3010-90">Nintendo</a>'s first console to introduce a disc medium instead of cartridges, the games were recorded on mini DVDs. The disc can hold 1.5 gigabytes of data - 190 times more than what an <a href="/nintendo-64/3045-43/" data-ref-id="3045-43">N64</a> game cartridge can hold. Technologically speaking, the GameCube was more powerful than the <a href="/playstation-2/3045-19/" data-ref-id="3045-19">PS2</a> at about half the size of the <a href="/xbox/3045-32/" data-ref-id="3045-32">Xbox</a>.</p><h3>Colour Schemes</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9566/393160-gamecube_1_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-393160" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="1.0327022375215" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:103.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9566/393160-gamecube_1_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-393160"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9566/393160-gamecube_1_1.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9566/393160-gamecube_1_1.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The GameCube's hardware used techniques to remain small and powerful.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Like Nintendo's previous console, the Nintendo 64, and many of the company's handheld consoles, the GameCube was released in a variety of colours. The two most common colours were Indigo and Jet Black (Indigo being the default color). Later, a Platinum color scheme was released and marketed as limited edition. "Orange Spice" GameCubes were also made available, but were primarily available in Japan. The GameCube's model numbers (DOL-001 and DOL-101) were a reference to Dolphin, the GameCube's codename. Official accessories and peripherals also had model numbers beginning with DOL.</p><h3>Peripherals</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/1072721-nintendo01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1072721" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/1072721-nintendo01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1072721"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/1072721-nintendo01.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/1072721-nintendo01.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The GameCube has four controller ports.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The GameCube allows direct connectivity with Nintendo’s handheld, the <a href="/game-boy-advance/3045-4/" data-ref-id="3045-4">Game Boy Advance</a>, via a link cable. Later on, Nintendo released the Game Boy Player which allowed backward compatibility with <a href="/game-boy/3045-3/" data-ref-id="3045-3">Game Boy</a>, <a href="/game-boy-color/3045-57/" data-ref-id="3045-57">Game Boy Color</a> and Game Boy Advance games. There were also some games that supported <a href="/e-reader/3015-3782/" data-ref-id="3015-3782">e-Reader</a> connectivity, allowing players to scan in extra game features. Supported games include Animal Crossing and <a href="/pokemon-channel/3030-19224/" data-ref-id="3030-19224">Pokémon Channel</a>.</p><h3>Online</h3><p style="">Although only a few games have online play for the GameCube (such as the <a href="/phantasy-star-online-episode-i-ii-plus/3030-11701/" data-ref-id="3030-11701">Phantasy Star Online</a> franchise), the GameCube offers LAN support that allows eight GameCubes to be connected together to play a multiplayer game. Using this, fans created unofficial online services for the GameCube, such as Warp Pipe, that used LAN technology for online play.</p><h3><a href="/gamecube-controller/3000-47/" data-ref-id="3000-47">Controller</a></h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3715/811125-gamecube_controller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-811125" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.61356466876972" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:61.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3715/811125-gamecube_controller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-811125"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3715/811125-gamecube_controller.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3715/811125-gamecube_controller.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>A standard GameCube controller</figcaption></figure><p style="">The inputs on a GameCube controller consist of a large, green A-button, a small, red B-button, two gray X- and Y- buttons, two analog sticks (with the larger being gray and simply called "the analogue stick" and the smaller being yellow and called "the C-stick", in reference to the C-buttons on the N64 controller), a D-pad, two shoulder buttons, and a purple Z-button on top of the controller next to the right shoulder button. Some Wii games <a href="/gamecube-controller-support-on-wii/3015-2523/" data-ref-id="3015-2523">support the use of the GameCube controller</a> (this is taken advantage of in Virtual Console and WiiWare games as well).</p><p style="">The wireless version of the controller was called the Wavebird. It allowed players to play from up to 20 feet away. It had the same button layout than the original controller except for an on and off button and a bulkier feel. The controller came with a wireless receiver. To play, the player had to tune his controller to one of the 16 radio channels that the little wheel at the bottom of the controller offered. Then, he had to put the same channel number on the receiver, plug the receiver into the GameCube's controller socket, turn on his controller and a light on the receiver would tell the player that it was receiving a signal.

The line was later expanded to include the more-powerful Atari XL models and then the XE models. Atari's second cartridge-based console, the <a href="/atari-5200/3045-67/" data-ref-id="3045-67">Atari 5200</a>, is also based on the same hardware, resulting in many games appearing to be identical across all platforms. The Atari 5200 was followed by the Atari XE Game System which is also based on the Atari 8-bit computers.</p><h2>Hardware</h2><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4910/297922-atari_800xl_plain_white.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-297922" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.58747697974217" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:58.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4910/297922-atari_800xl_plain_white.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-297922"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4910/297922-atari_800xl_plain_white.jpg"></a><figcaption>Atari 800XL.</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">All models use the MOS Technology 6502 CPU, which is the same type of CPU used in the <a href="/atari-2600/3045-40/" data-ref-id="3045-40">Atari 2600</a> and the <a href="/nes/3045-21/" data-ref-id="3045-21">NES</a>. The computers also includes custom chips like the ANTIC display instruction processor, the CTIA/GTIA GPU and the POKEY audio chip. The Atari 400 and 800 were supposed to have 4kB and 8kB RAM respectively, and the names 400 and 800 were originally decided upon because of this, but both models were released with 8kB of RAM since the price of memory had fallen when they were released. The 400 has a membrane keyboard while the 800 has a regular one. The 800 also has two ROM cartridge slots instead of the single slot in the 400. Despite this, the 400 outsold the 800 somewhat.</p><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9560/1303271-atari_130xe.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1303271" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.6552" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:65.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9560/1303271-atari_130xe.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1303271"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9560/1303271-atari_130xe.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9560/1303271-atari_130xe.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Atari 130XE.</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">In 1982 the 1200XL was released which came with 64kB RAM, a redesigned aluminum case and more custom keys. Some older software was incompatible with the new OS however. A year later the 600XL and 800XL were released which replaced the other models, including the 1200XL. The 600XL had 16kB of RAM and the 800XL had 64kB like the 1200XL did, and used the same general design. A new hardware feature on both these models was the expansion port called the Parallel Bus Interface.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">After Atari was acquired by Jack Tremiel in 1985, the 8-bit Atari computers once again got a new hardware revision known as the XE series along with the 16-bit <a href="/atari-st/3045-13/" data-ref-id="3045-13">Atari ST</a> computer. XE stands for XL-Enhanced. They have a similar case design to the Atari ST line of computers but are otherwise identical on the hardware level to the old 8-bit computers, except for the newer Enhanced Cartridge Interface instead of the Paralell Bus Interface and the fact that the 130XE had 128kB of RAM.</p><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9560/1303270-atari_xe_console.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1303270" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.83747178329571" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:83.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9560/1303270-atari_xe_console.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1303270"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9560/1303270-atari_xe_console.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9560/1303270-atari_xe_console.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>XE Game System.</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">In 1987, after seeing the success of the <a href="/nes/3045-21/" data-ref-id="3045-21">NES</a>, Atari wanted back in on the console market. They</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">used hardware from a 65XE to create what we know today as the Atari XE Game System. It included a detachable keyboard, a joystick, a <a href="/light-gun/3015-2354/" data-ref-id="3015-2354">lightgun</a> and the games Bug Hunt and <a href="/flight-simulator-ii/3030-14112/" data-ref-id="3030-14112">Flight Simulator II</a>. Instead of cassette tapes or diskettes, the XE Game System uses cartridges like most other home consoles at the time. Because the XE Game System was almost the same hardware-wise as the 65XE, a lot of software and hardware for the Atari 8-bit computers are compatible. The system didn't sell as well as hoped, partly because of bad marketing and the fact that new releases for the system were few and far between.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">In 1992, Atari officially dropped support for their entire 8-bit line of machines.</p><h3>Models</h3><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9560/1303277-atari_400_keyboard.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1303277" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9560/1303277-atari_400_keyboard.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1303277"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9560/1303277-atari_400_keyboard.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9560/1303277-atari_400_keyboard.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Atari 400's membrane keyboard.</figcaption></figure><ul><li>400 and 800 (1979) – original machines in beige cases, 400 has a membrane keyboard, 800 has "full-travel" keys, two cartridge ports, monitor output, expandable memory slots (up to 48 KB).

      <deck><![CDATA[The Neo Geo was a console released by SNK in 1990, featuring a 16/32-bit 68000 CPU with an additional 8-bit Z80 CPU and custom GPU chipset. An arcade-based console considerably powerful for a home system at the time, the Neo Geo was notoriously expensive (costing $650 at launch) and aggressively marketed as an Advanced Entertainment System (AES).]]></deck>

It decided to differentiate the Neo Geo from its competitors by bringing arcade-quality graphics into living rooms. Marketing was heavily geared towards making it a gaming connoisseur's console, and it was even couched as a 24-bit system.</p><p style="">The "24-bit" marketing label was due to using both the Motorola 68000, a hybrid 16/32-bit CPU, along with the Zilog Z80, an 8-bit CPU. However, <a href="/sega/3010-62/" data-ref-id="3010-62">Sega</a>'s <a href="/genesis/3045-6/" data-ref-id="3045-6">Mega Drive/Genesis</a> console also used the 68000 (at a lower clock speed) and Z80, yet was marketed as a 16-bit console, in comparison.</p><p style="">Much of the Neo Geo's advanced graphical capabilities, however, came from the use of custom GPU graphics processors, both within the system as well as additional chips on individual game cartridges, much like an arcade machine. The Neo Geo featured up to seven specialized processors, including the two CPU processors and several graphics chips. And while the RAM was not very large, it could access larger ROM data directly from cartridges at high speeds. These features made the Neo Geo the most powerful home gaming system at the time of its release in 1990, rivalled only by the <a href="/sharp-x68000/3045-95/" data-ref-id="3045-95">Sharp X68000</a> home <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">computer</a> (which also used custom GPU graphics processors). Another new feature of the Neo Geo was the use of removable memory cards to save data; it was the first console to have such a feature.</p><p style="">It is the longest supported home platform, having its first game game released in 1990 and the last game, <a href="/samurai-shodown-v-special/3030-6538/" data-ref-id="3030-6538">Samurai Shodown V Special</a>, released in 2004.</p><h2>Multi Video System</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/121177/1675337-ikyjo_dscn3310.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1675337" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/121177/1675337-ikyjo_dscn3310.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1675337"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/121177/1675337-ikyjo_dscn3310.jpg"></a><figcaption>Bare MVS board with typical MVS carts</figcaption></figure><p style="">The MVS (Multi Video System) was a fantastic innovation for the arcade industry. It allowed arcade operators to save on much-needed space by having a single cabinet have multiple games. The MVS came in two, four, and six slot systems; these would allow gamers to pick which game they wanted at the title screen. The control options were the same as the AES four-button system, the only difference being the controls were mounted to cabinet. A key difference between MVS and AES were the cartridges: a MVS cart will not work in an AES, and vice-versa. The goal behind this incompatibility was to deter arcade operators from buying the cheaper AES cartridges. The MVS carts from did not come with colorful artwork or plastic boxes like their home counterparts; they would often come in plain cardboard boxes with only a marquee slip or flyer.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/121177/1676408-japanese_arcade.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1676408" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.67" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:67.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/121177/1676408-japanese_arcade.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1676408"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/121177/1676408-japanese_arcade.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/121177/1676408-japanese_arcade.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Candy Cabs lined up at a Japanese arcade</figcaption></figure><p style="">Candy Cabs are Japanese sit down cabinets that SNK used for their MVS machines inside Japanese arcades. These machines are typically smaller and lighter than there American counterparts, some weighing as little as 175 lbs (80 kg).

The term has since become slang to describe AES cartridges themselves, However the proper name for a AES Neo Geo game is NGH. The way to tell an NGH cartridge from its arcade counterpart is the large colorful artwork featured on the home carts. Arcade cartridges had no branding or consumer packaging because they were hidden inside the machines.</p><p style="">Before the AES was made commercially available it was only sold to larger video rental stores who would in turn rent the system out. This was an unusual practice for a video game platform, and was speculated that this was SNK testing the waters for mass consumption.</p><h2>Neo Geo Memory Card</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/121177/1696917-2046880692_2a897278f8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1696917" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="1.3333333333333" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:133.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/121177/1696917-2046880692_2a897278f8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1696917"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/121177/1696917-2046880692_2a897278f8.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/121177/1696917-2046880692_2a897278f8.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Neo Geo Memory Card</figcaption></figure><p style="">The Neo Geo system was the first platform to use a removable memory card.

Unlike more popular CD systems at the time thie Neo Geo CD only contained a single speed CD drive, this meant that load times on some games, could be between three to five minutes. While for some systems this would be a burden the fact that the platform was almost exclusively made for fast action arcade experienced this became a much more severe problem for SNK. Fighting games for instance would often load between each round, when compared to it's cartridge counterparts this made the games seemed like lesser products.</p><p style="">In 1995 the Neo Geo CD underwent a redesign, and was renamed the Neo Geo CDZ. It had much of the same hardware, but with a dual-speed CD drive and a larger memory cache. This reduced load times for CD-based games.

There was little effort to emulate or adapt MVS hardware builds for home entertainment use, so cartridges costed as much as existing arcade cabinets ($100-$300). The console failed to gain market share because of these prohibitive costs, although it gained a cult following amongst its targeted demographic of gaming aficionados. The console lost what market share it had earned among enthusiasts by refusing to innovate or improve the system when its competitors did, especially when it did not make the jump to the 32-bit 5th generation of consoles in the late 90s.</p><p style="">Efforts to make its games more accessible by porting some of the console's exclusives to specialized arcade cabinets enjoyed limited success, but the console could still not compete with its competitors' price cuts and more extensive game libraries. The increased access to the Neo Geo's library did however cement SNK's reputation as a developer of solid fighting games, fueling its success for the rest of the 90's with hits like the <a href="/king-of-fighters/3025-407/" data-ref-id="3025-407">King of Fighters</a> franchise.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8153/924841-90_neo_geo_aes_general2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-924841" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.63651050080775" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:63.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8153/924841-90_neo_geo_aes_general2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-924841"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8153/924841-90_neo_geo_aes_general2.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8153/924841-90_neo_geo_aes_general2.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>AES Console with 2 controllers and library of games.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The console itself ceased manufacture in 1997, but games for the console would continue to be made and released in arcades, mainly in <a href="/japan/3035-37/" data-ref-id="3035-37">Japan</a>.

An arcade stick featuring the same layout as the Neo Geo's MVS counterpart was the pack-in controller used for the system. The controllers used 30 mm arcade buttons and a 35mm ball top joystick.The physical base of the the stick was quite large measuring 280mm x 190mm x 95mm (Width Height Depth), nearly the same size as the system.

The buttons on the stick used arcade micro switches but, unlike real arcade buttons, they did not sit inside sleeves. This made it possible for the buttons to rub up against the shell of the stick, this would result in loud squeaking noises or even get stuck underneath the shell. A common aesthetic problem with the AES stick was the joystick ball top getting hairline cracks in the finish, which in extreme cases would cause the ball top to split open. Finally, the button layout on the original Neo Geo was not very ergonomic, a problem which was addressed with the stick's redesign</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/121177/1692755-le_rarissime_neo_geo_mahjong_controller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1692755" data-size="medium" style="width: 479px" data-ratio="0.75156576200418" data-width="479" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/121177/1692755-le_rarissime_neo_geo_mahjong_controller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1692755"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/121177/1692755-le_rarissime_neo_geo_mahjong_controller.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/121177/1692755-le_rarissime_neo_geo_mahjong_controller.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Official Neo Geo Mahjong Controller Released in 1990</figcaption></figure><p style="">A Mahjong controller was released in 1990 for the Neo Geo AES and is now a rare collectible.

The system's high price point at launch coupled with the fact that games could be hundreds of dollars new meant that most people's libraries of games stayed small. This lead to obscure or popular games becoming more valuable and difficult to track down. For example, the popular AES game <a href="/metal-slug-super-vehicle-001/3030-6941/" data-ref-id="3030-6941">Metal Slug</a> regularly sells at auctions for eight hundred to two thousand US dollars.

Unfortunately, things did not pan out that way.</p><h2>Development and History</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56469/2299347-pan_3do.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2299347" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.73701298701299" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:73.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56469/2299347-pan_3do.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2299347"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/56469/2299347-pan_3do.jpg"></a><figcaption>Panasonic 3DO Model FZ-1.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The 3DO console was intended to be made by any manufacturer who signed a licensing agreement with the 3DO company. These companies included some of the world’s largest electronics companies at the time: Goldstar, Sanyo, Samsung, AT&amp;T, Creative Labs and even Panasonic, which at the time of the 3DO's release was the largest electronic manufacturer. A second part of 3DO’s business strategy was to be extremely liberal when it came to manufacturing the system; the idea was that there would be no designated system specs. This gave manufacturers the freedom to create anything they wanted for any person or audience. In concept it would give consumers more choices as the 3DO would be extremely upgradeable. The idea was to make the 3DO as simple to manufacture as a CD player, while still functioning as a home entertainment system, a PC, a music player, and, most importantly, a video game system. The 3DO would also allow third party developers to push new technology, like wireless and DVD remote-style controllers, as well as numerous multimedia features.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/1083968-sanyo3do.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1083968" data-size="large" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.425" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:42.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/1083968-sanyo3do.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1083968"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/8273/1083968-sanyo3do.jpg"></a><figcaption>A 3DO of Sanyo manufacturing.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Trip Hawkins wanted people to see the 3DO as a multimedia unit; however, with an MSRP of $700, audiences everywhere rejected it as an overpriced piece of tech. Consumers also rejected the 3DO due to its lack of quality launch titles. Some of the manufacturers caught on to how the 3DO was being perceived by audiences and attempted to remedy it by manufacturing cheaper versions of the unit. Their attempts were somewhat limited by the fact that the manufactures of the system got paid for systems sold, but not royalties for the game. Later models were priced downward of $500 but by then the damage had already been done, by this time the Sony Playstation and Sega Saturn were entering the market and could do a lot more for a lot less.</p><p style="">The 3DO console debuted in 1993, but with no in-house development and third-party support dwindling, the 3DO was effectively dead by 1997 and in the half-off bins of almost every video game store in America. By the end of the console's life and the bankruptcy of the 3DO company, the console had only sold a measly 2 million units.</p><p style="">The 3DO Company did try to follow up the console with a second video game console design dubbed M2, but this console never made it past the initial design and test system phase, effectively cancelling many titles in development for the system, including the prototype for <a href="/d2/3030-18898/" data-ref-id="3030-18898">D2</a>. The M2 design was eventually sold off to Panasonic/Matsushita.</p><h2>Design</h2><p style="">Despite ultimately being a failure the 3DO featured several notable innovations. While some console manufacturers were still utilizing cartridges, the 3DO embraced the CD format. With special additions, up to 8 players could play cooperatively on a single console. The system also featured an internal memory allowing players to save their game data in the console.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/1083971-mb_fz1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1083971" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.54397394136808" data-width="307" style="width: 307px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:54.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/1083971-mb_fz1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1083971"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8273/1083971-mb_fz1.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8273/1083971-mb_fz1.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Inside a Goldstar 3DO.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The console had expansion modules which gave owners the ability to turn their console into a media player. However, expansions that allowed owners to play VHS tapes as well as VCDs were either rare and hard to come by or outrageously expensive. Also, the ability to play VHS tapes was a questionable feature mostly due to VCDs becoming more affordable and visually superior.</p><p style="">This again highlights yet another flaw that plagued owners of 3DOs and the console: features that were promised at launch were not a reality. Expansion modules which would have allowed for more RAM or memory never quite came to fruition. In fact, the much requested memory expansion for the unit was only released in Japan and in limited supply in the United States.</p><h2>Games and Development Support</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/1083973-burning_soldier.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1083973" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/1083973-burning_soldier.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1083973"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8273/1083973-burning_soldier.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8273/1083973-burning_soldier.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>3DO version of Burning Soldier.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Despite being a commercial failure, the 3DO featured an impressive amount of third-party support for its first year. Just like their manufacturing policy, the 3DO Company was extremely liberal when it came to ensuring quality games on their console. A few of the systems highlights include <a href="/doom/3030-7326/" data-ref-id="3030-7326">Doom</a>, <a href="/samurai-shodown/3030-5692/" data-ref-id="3030-5692">Samurai Shodown</a>, <a href="/lemmings/3030-1446/" data-ref-id="3030-1446">Lemmings</a>, <a href="/the-need-for-speed/3030-4703/" data-ref-id="3030-4703">Need for Speed</a> and <a href="/road-rash/3030-8251/" data-ref-id="3030-8251">Road Rash</a>. On top of that, the 3DO benefited from having ports of arcade games such as the immensely popular <a href="/super-street-fighter-ii-turbo/3030-1251/" data-ref-id="3030-1251">Super Street Fighter II Turbo</a> in its catalog. Also, a certain street racing series called <a href="/need-for-speed/3025-483/" data-ref-id="3025-483">Need for Speed</a> got its start on the 3DO. However, quality games for the 3DO came in inconsistent bursts. Also, due to the console's adoption of the CD format, it saw a large number of questionable <a href="/full-motion-video/3015-604/" data-ref-id="3015-604">FMV</a> games that were becoming popular at the time.</p><h2>System specifications</h2><p style="">A lot of the 3DO is highly upgradeable and can differ between manufacturers:</p><ul><li>32-bit 12.5Mhz RISC CPU (ARM60) made by Advanced RISC Machines (Roughly equivalent to a 25Mhz 68030)</li><li>Two Accelerated Video Co-Processors with the following features:<br /><ul><li>25Mhz clock rate.</li><li>Capable of producing 9-16 million REAL pixels per second (36-64 Mpix/sec</li><li>interpolated), distorted, scaled, rotated and texture mapped.</li><li>Able to map a rectangular bitmap onto any arbitrary 4-point polygon.</li><li>Texturemap source bitmaps can be 1,2,4,6,8, or 16 bits per pixel and are</li><li>RLE compressed for a maximum combination of both high resolution and small storage space.</li><li>Supports transparency, translucency, and color-shading effects.</li><li>640x480 pixel resolution at 16.7 million colors</li></ul></li><li>Custom 16-bit Digital Signal Processor (DSP) with the following features: <ul><li>Specifically designed for mixing, manipulating, and synthesizing CD quality sound.</li><li>Can decompress sound 2:1 or 4:1 on the fly, saving memory and bandwidth.</li><li>25Mhz clock rate.</li><li>Pipelined CISC architecture.</li><li>16-bit register size.</li><li>17 separate 16-bit DMA channels to and from system memory.</li><li>On chip instruction SRAM and register memory.</li><li>20-bit internal processing.</li><li>Special filtering capable of creating effects such as 3D sound.</li></ul></li><li>Separate BUS for video refresh updates (VRAM is dual ported)</li><li>Super Fast BUS Speed (50 Megabytes per second)</li><li>Math Co-Processor custom designed by NTG for accelerating fixed-point matrix operations.

      <deck><![CDATA[The CD-i was the first CD-based game console. Produced by Philips, it was intended to be a computer for your living room.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<p style="">The <a href="/philips-interactive-media-inc/3010-48/" data-ref-id="3010-48"> Philips</a> CD-i, released on November 2, 1991, not only boasted games in its library, but also some encyclopedia and <a href="/edutainment/3015-2173/" data-ref-id="3015-2173"> "Edutainment"</a> products, as well as feature-length movies (which required an additional video card), providing digital home video releases before DVD entered the market. This device is probably best remembered for the late-night commercials that ran in the early 1990s showing off its awesome power as a hapless man searched for the "meaning of life". The system eventually gives him his answer, after forcing him to play tennis and other video games. The system used <a href="/compact-disc/3055-2133/" data-ref-id="3055-2133">compact discs</a> for its software releases, and also featured <a href="/full-motion-video/3015-604/" data-ref-id="3015-604"> full motion video</a> content. Philips' attempt to enter the gaming market would be trumped by <a href="/sony-computer-entertainment-america/3010-313/" data-ref-id="3010-313"> Sony</a>'s <a href="/playstation/3045-22/" data-ref-id="3045-22"> PlayStation</a>, which unlike the CD-i, featured 3D-graphics rendering technology and significantly more support from first- and third-party developers.</p><p style="">The system also suffered from a bit of an identity crisis. Upon release, Philips did not wish to compete with the likes of <a href="/sega/3010-62/" data-ref-id="3010-62"> Sega</a> and <a href="/nintendo/3010-90/" data-ref-id="3010-90"> Nintendo</a> in the home console market; instead, Philips positioned the console as a "multimedia system" that could play videos, run applications, and could act as an educational tool. This led to a swath of educational game releases, which has never been a bestselling niche in the entertainment software market. Philips tried to position the system as a console that could compete with the likes of the <a href="/sega-cd/3045-29/" data-ref-id="3045-29"> Sega CD</a> and <a href="/3do/3045-26/" data-ref-id="3045-26"> 3DO</a>, but by then most consumers did not view the console as a serious contender to incumbents, not to mention its high starting price and underwhelming library of games.</p><p style="">The CD-i also has the notable (and dubious) distinction of being the only non-<a href="/nintendo/3010-90/" data-ref-id="3010-90">Nintendo</a> console to have <a href="/mario/3025-1/" data-ref-id="3025-1"> Mario</a> and <a href="/the-legend-of-zelda/3025-9/" data-ref-id="3025-9"> Zelda</a> titles developed for it, due to a contractual obligation Nintendo had with Philips dating back to the <a href="/snes/3045-9/" data-ref-id="3045-9"> SNES</a> CD project. In total, four such titles existed on the system: <a href="/link-the-faces-of-evil/3030-5043/" data-ref-id="3030-5043">Link: The Faces of Evil,</a> <a href="/zelda-the-wand-of-gamelon/3030-17713/" data-ref-id="3030-17713"> Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon,</a> <a href="/zeldas-adventure/3030-14181/" data-ref-id="3030-14181"> Zelda's Adventures</a> and <a href="/hotel-mario/3030-5841/" data-ref-id="3030-5841"> Hotel Mario</a>. A fifth title, Super Mario Wacky Worlds, was planned but never released. None of the titles were developed by Nintendo themselves, but by third parties or by Philips themselves.</p><h2>Models</h2><p style="">Phillips sold many varied models on the CD-i system, designed for consumer, professional and development players.</p><h3>CD-i Player 200 Series</h3><h4>Models: 205, 210, 220</h4><p style="">The 200 Series models were design of general public consumption and made avail at major home electronics stores worldwide.</p><h3>CD-i Player 300 Series</h3><h4>Models: 310, 350, 360, 370</h4><p style="">The 300 Series models were portable versions of the players, designed and marketed for strictly those in the professional fields.</p><h3>CD-i Player 400 Series</h3><h4>Models: 450, 470, 490</h4><p style="">The 400 Series models were slimmed-down players that were aimed at educational markets.

      <deck><![CDATA[The Atari Jaguar was the first 64-Bit game console, and Atari's final console.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">After an absence from the video game console market since the demise of the 7800 system in 1991, <a href="/atari/3010-182/" data-ref-id="3010-182">Atari</a> made its return with the Jaguar. The system was released in 1993 in <a href="/san-francisco/3035-191/" data-ref-id="3035-191">San Francisco</a> and in 1994 for the rest of <a href="/the-united-states-of-america/3035-396/" data-ref-id="3035-396">America</a> and <a href="/europe/3035-289/" data-ref-id="3035-289">Europe</a>. Unfortunately, the Jaguar was a commercial failure that left the company financially crippled. It was the last console Atari produced.</p><p style="">In the early 1990s, Atari was negotiating with a British company called Flare Technology, who had designed the unreleased Konix Multisystem console. Atari was impressed by the work Flare had done on the Konix, and provided to the funding to found a new company, Flare 2. Flare 2 started development on two consoles, the 32-bit Panther and the 64-bit Jaguar. Eventually, after seeing the Jaguar's graphical abilities, Atari ceased work on Panther and focused their attention on the more powerful Jaguar. They aimed to surpass the abilities of the Sega Genesis and the Super Nintendo, and compete against the new generation of consoles in development by <a href="/the-3do-company/3010-224/" data-ref-id="3010-224">3DO</a>, <a href="/nintendo/3010-90/" data-ref-id="3010-90">Nintendo</a> and <a href="/sega/3010-62/" data-ref-id="3010-62">Sega</a>, while still remaining cost effective. Despite the Panther's cancellation, some games developed for it saw release. For example, the game <a href="/cybermorph/3030-9922/" data-ref-id="3030-9922">Cybermorph</a> that came bundled with the Atari Jaguar was a game designed for Panther.</p><h2>64-bit?</h2><p style="">Atari advertised the Jaguar aggressively in the press with its "Do the Math" campaign; boasting about its technical superiority over the 16-bit platforms, and claiming to be the first 64-bit home console on the market. While the Jaguar was certainly more powerful than the <a href="/snes/3045-9/" data-ref-id="3045-9">Super Nintendo</a> and <a href="/genesis/3045-6/" data-ref-id="3045-6">Genesis</a> in most respects, these claims caused some controversy.</p><p style="">Many technically knowledgeable industry insiders and gamers claimed that the Jaguar was not a true 64-bit platform, because the Jaguar’s Motorola 68000 CPU chip was only 32-bit, and the primary GPU delivered a 32-bit instruction set. The complaint is similar to the earlier argument that the <a href="/turbografx-16/3045-55/" data-ref-id="3045-55">TurboGrafx-16</a> was actually an 8-bit system, since it was based around an 8-bit CPU (but with 16-bit video chips), and equally gray.</p><p style="">A major contributor to this issue was the industry's desire to use "bits" as a concrete measure of subjective "impressiveness." With Sega and Nintendo promoting 16-bit systems as vastly superior to previous 8-bit systems, gamers naturally expected a similar, obvious jump in quality with the Jaguar. In theory, 64-bit games should have been 4x as impressive as 16-bit systems (as frequently cited when the Jaguar is compared to the <a href="/">Nintendo 64</a>). In reality, this is misunderstanding the meaning of "bits," and applying some wishful thinking toward rating a console's performance by a simple number.</p><p style="">Ultimately, due to Jaguar's chip set architecture and processing methods, there was just enough to backup Atari’s 64-bit claim. The design, if always followed as intended, would indeed utilise 64-bit graphical processing and buck claims of the Jaguar being simply "two 32-bit chips glued together." Unfortunately, the architecture proved difficult for third-party developers to utilize effectively, and made porting games less profitable - a situation echoed by developers' issues with the <a href="/playstation-3/3045-35/" data-ref-id="3045-35">Playstation 3</a>. Thus the games most often fell short of the system's theoretical potential.</p><p style="">Jaguar <a href="http://www.jaguarsector.com/index.php?showforum=2" rel="nofollow">programming enthusiasts</a> looking over dumped code from retail titles have suggested many companies treated the Motorola CPU as the main processing unit, instead of as a controller for the 64-bit Tom and Jerry "workhorse" chips as Atari intended. This would artificially limit the machine's capabilities, and has been cited as the primary reason for choppy performance in some games (<a href="/checkered-flag/3030-12786/" data-ref-id="3030-12786">Checkered Flag</a> is a specific example). It is unclear as to how frequently this occurred, and if it was due to poor documentation from Atari, or simply that developers were more familiar with the common 68000 chip.</p><h2>Legacy</h2><p style="">The Jaguar platform did boast some well-received games, including <a href="/alien-vs-predator/3030-8142/" data-ref-id="3030-8142">Alien VS Predator</a>, <a href="/doom/3030-7326/" data-ref-id="3030-7326">Doom</a> and <a href="/tempest-2000/3030-8496/" data-ref-id="3030-8496">Tempest 2000</a>, but the graphical leap from 16-bit systems was not extreme, contrary to the expectations Sega had created. Indeed, a large number of Jaguar releases were ports of games released on the Genesis and the Super Nintendo.</p><p style="">The Jaguar was a powerful system for its time, with many of the units being sold to the loyal and dedicated Atari fan base that had built up since the early 1980‘s. Many clever and innovative ideas for the system were in the pipeline, most of which never made it past the prototype phase because of poor sales and short life span of the console.</p><p style="">The Jaguar’s success was hindered by a number of contributing factors, such as a limited game library, third party software development issues, and fierce competition in the form of <a href="/sony-corporation/3010-3223/" data-ref-id="3010-3223">Sony</a>’s <a href="/playstation/3045-22/" data-ref-id="3045-22">PlayStation</a> and <a href="/sega/3010-62/" data-ref-id="3010-62">Sega</a>’s <a href="/saturn/3045-42/" data-ref-id="3045-42">Saturn</a>, which finally finished off the Jaguar by mid-1996.</p><p style="">In the late 1990’s <a href="/hasbro-interactive-inc/3010-531/" data-ref-id="3010-531">Hasbro interactive</a> bought out all Atari properties and declared the Jaguar an open platform for homebrew development. Today the Atari Jaguar has a loyal cult following, who use the console for all sorts of development, including utilizing the COM <a href="/lynx/3045-7/" data-ref-id="3045-7">Lynx</a> and "CatBox" device for the networking of up to 32 Jaguar consoles.</p><h2>Specifications</h2><h3>First Chip - Tom Chip (26.59 MHz)</h3><ul><li><ul><li>Graphics processing unit (GPU) – 32-bit RISC architecture, 4 KB internal cache.</li><li>Object Processor – 64-bit RISC architecture.</li></ul></li><li>Blitter – 64-bit RISC architecture; high speed logic operations, z-buffering and Gouraud shading, with 64-bit internal registers.</li><li>DRAM controller, 32-bit memory management.</li></ul><h3>Second Chip - Jerry Chip (26.59 MHz)</h3><ul><li>Digital Signal Processor – 32-bit RISC architecture, 8 KB internal cache.

While other consoles do this at the software level, Jaguar consoles are PAL or NTSC specific, and the cartridges themselves are commonly agnostic.

The port is simply left exposed on the top of the console. Because of this design flaw, contacts on both the console and the cartridges are extremely sensitive to dust, oil, corrosion, or other elements that prevent a solid contact. Poor contact between the cartridge and the console leads to the common "Red Screen of Death" on booting the console. Contrary to popular belief, this does not indicate a hardware failure. In nearly every case, the red screen can be cleared by aggressively cleaning the cartridge with mild solvents (alcohol or peroxide) - just blowing on the cart won't usually do.</p><h2>U.S. Launch Titles</h2><p style="">The following are launch titles for the Jaguar when it was released in November 1993.</p><ul><li><a href="/cybermorph/3030-9922/" data-ref-id="3030-9922">Cybermorph</a></li><li><a href="/raiden/3030-16693/" data-ref-id="3030-16693">Raiden</a></li><li><a href="/trevor-mcfur-in-the-crescent-galaxy/3030-19437/" data-ref-id="3030-19437">Trevor McFur in the Crescent Galaxy</a></li></ul>]]></description>

Commodore wanted to, as their CEO <a href="/jack-tramiel/3040-98032/" data-ref-id="3040-98032"> Jack Tramiel </a>put it, "make a computer for the masses". The VIC-20 had an unusual beginning as nothing more than a graphics chip. After Commodore could not sell this chip, they decided to construct an entire home computer around it and advertise it as an inexpensive computer that was accessible to every member of the household. The plan worked, and the VIC 20 sold tremendously well when it was first released to the public. It was so successful that the VIC-20 would go down in the history books as the very first computer to have sold more than 1 million units.</p><h2>Development</h2><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/10320-Commodore_PET4032.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-10320" data-size="small" style="width:284px;" data-ratio="1.1478873239437" data-width="0" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:114.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/10320-Commodore_PET4032.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-10320"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/26/10320-Commodore_PET4032.jpg"></a><figcaption>Commodore PET 4032</figcaption></figure><p style="">The VIC was the successor to Commodore's PET line of computers, but Commodore decided to treat the VIC differently as they were going for a completely different audience with this computer. In order to buy a computer from the PET product line, a consumer had to find a licensed seller. As a result, the PET computers were only available at hobby shops or dedicated computer stores. When the VIC arrived Commodore did away with their licensing business model and sold the computer to any store willing to stock them. The computers were appearing everywhere, even auto shops and hardware stores were selling the computers next to their products, and this solidified the VIC as a computer even for people who did not know anything about computers.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/1104712-3407577565_dd83045b5e.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1104712" data-size="small" style="width: 310px" data-ratio="1.6129032258065" data-width="310" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:161.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/1104712-3407577565_dd83045b5e.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1104712"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8273/1104712-3407577565_dd83045b5e.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8273/1104712-3407577565_dd83045b5e.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption> TV Screen Not Included</figcaption></figure><p style="">In April 1980, at a meeting of general managers outside <a href="/london/3035-212/" data-ref-id="3035-212">London</a>, Jack Tramiel declared that he wanted a low-cost color computer. When most of the GMs argued against it, he said: "The Japanese are coming, so we will become the Japanese." This was in keeping with Tramiel's philosophy which was to make "computers for the masses, not the classes". The concept was championed at the meeting by <a title="Michael Tomczyk" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Tomczyk" rel="nofollow">Michael Tomczyk</a>, newly hired marketing strategist and assistant to the president, Tony Tokai, General Manager of Commodore-Japan, and Kit Spencer, the UK's top marketing executive. Then, the project was given to Commodore Japan; an engineering team led by <a href="/y-terakura/3040-65272/" data-ref-id="3040-65272">Yash Terakura</a> created the VIC-1001 for the Japanese market. The VIC-20 first debuted in <a href="/japan/3035-37/" data-ref-id="3035-37">Japan</a> as VIC-1001 in 1980, before VIC-20 was introduced to the US in 1981.</p><p style="">The VIC-20 had a lot of appeal to the mass market due to its simple design and low price, but that started to show some problems of its own. CEO Jack Tramiel, being the frugal and hard liner that he was, told his engineers they could only use 1K chips in the new machine because Commodore had a huge inventory they were unable to use in other products. In the end the VIC had 5.5K of RAM, 2K of which was used by the Basic Operating System. To do any real development in such a small area required a machine language.</p><p style=""> </p><p style="">However, even in the early '80s that simply was not enough RAM for various tasks. This was such an issue that developers of software for the VIC-20 were often forced to write code for the machine by hand. Fortunately, Commodore soon released several ROM expansion packs, similar to what would later be released for the N64. Commodore powered their machine using the 1Mhz, 8 Bit CSG/MOS 6502 CPU. With good (for the time) sound and color graphics, Commodore had produced a technical marvel and the machine became a smash hit. Like the PET, the Commodore VIC-20 was released worldwide relatively quickly after its U.S. and Canadian introduction.</p><h2>Revolutionary Design</h2><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/1104709-3359079156_890988ab94.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1104709" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/1104709-3359079156_890988ab94.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1104709"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8273/1104709-3359079156_890988ab94.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8273/1104709-3359079156_890988ab94.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Full Package</figcaption></figure><p style="">Like many of their previous computers the VIC-20 had many innovations that shaped the computer industry greatly. The Commodore VIC-20 was the first color computer that retailed as a "computer for the masses" at less than US$300.</p><p style="">But a low selling price wasn't the only thing that Commodore used to entice non computer hobbyists to buy their computer. The VIC-20 utilised a user-friendly version of BASIC 2.0 allowing for easy programming. The VIC-20 could be attached to any mainstream television to allow for visuals, so it did not require a dedicated monitor. As such, the VIC-20 was an important breakthrough for computers overall as the VIC-20 provided many consumers with their first experience with basic programming. The VIC-20 also had a floppy disk expansion and could be connected to a printer like all computers at the time.</p><h2>Reception and Sales</h2><p style="">Some critics said the machine was seriously underpowered, and for the most part they were correct. Despite this lack of power the computer sold extremely well, helped in part by advertising campaigns featuring <a href="/william-shatner/3040-15212/" data-ref-id="3040-15212"> William Shatner</a>.</p><p style="">Other than the extremely affordable price, consumers were attracted to the VIC because of its user-friendly deisgn that didn't require unnecessary input to use. For its ease of use and affordable price the VIC-20 sold over 2.5 million units worldwide.</p><h2>The End of the System</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9566/397506-commodore64_350px.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-397506" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="1" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9566/397506-commodore64_350px.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-397506"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9566/397506-commodore64_350px.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9566/397506-commodore64_350px.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The End of an Era</figcaption></figure><p style="">The VIC-20's lifespan was cut short by the early 1980s. Late 1982 saw the beginning of the end with the announcement of the <a href="/commodore-64/3045-14/" data-ref-id="3045-14"> Commodore 64</a>. At first the idea of a new Commodre computer went largely ignored, and it was believed that if the rumors were true it was merely a new version of the VIC. In fact at one point people thought the C64 was actually a codename for a VIC-64.</p><p style="">When the rumors were finally confirmed, VIC 20 users and sellers panicked. For the average computer hobbyist hardware upgrading was already a common concept. For the mass market however, the idea that they would have to buy a new computer to replace a recently purchased piece of technology was new and unusual. This panic led many VIC-20 retailers to dramatically drop the price of the computer, which in turn devalued the computer and affirmed Commodore's belief that it was time to drop support for the computer. By 1984 it was obvious that there would not be a place in the Commodore lineup for the venerable VIC-20 and all production for the computer ceased in favor of the C64.</p><p style=""> </p><h2>System Specifications</h2><ul><li><b>CPU</b>: MOS 6502, 1MHz</li><li><b>RAM</b>: 5K (3.5K for the user)</li><li><b>Display</b>: (Screen not included) 22 X 23 text, 176 X 184, 16 colors max</li><li><b>Ports</b>: composite video, joystick, cartridge, user port, serial peripheral port</li><li><b>Peripherals</b>: cassette recorder, printer, modem, external floppy drive</li><li><b>OS</b>: ROM BASIC</li></ul><h2>Fun Facts</h2><p style="">The VIC had different names in different parts of the world:</p><ul><li>The VIC-20 was first sold in <a href="/japan/3035-37/" data-ref-id="3035-37">Japan</a> as VIC-1001 in 1980, before being sold as VIC-20 in <a href="/north-america/3035-1664/" data-ref-id="3035-1664">North America</a> and <a href="/europe/3035-289/" data-ref-id="3035-289">Europe</a> in 1981.</li><li>The German produced VICs were labeled VC-20, which was supposed to be a play on the hugely popular and inexpensive <a href="/volkswagen/3010-5213/" data-ref-id="3010-5213"> Volkswagen</a> car brand. The VolksComputer was a big hit in Europe.

The naming of the 32X refers to its dual 32-bit RISC processors, seen at the time as the “next generation” of gaming standards as both the Genesis and the <a href="/snes/3045-9/" data-ref-id="3045-9">Super Nintendo</a> were 16-bit consoles.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The 32X plugs into the top of the Genesis just as a game cartridge does, though a small adapter is required for the newer model of Genesis consoles as it is significantly smaller than the older models. After attachment of the 32X, all Genesis games are able to be played via the 32X input, with the exception of <a href="/virtua-racing/3030-11009/" data-ref-id="3030-11009">Virtua Racing</a> for the Genesis.</p><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3909/303288-segacd32x.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-303288" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.80188679245283" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3909/303288-segacd32x.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-303288"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3909/303288-segacd32x.jpg"></a><figcaption>The Sega CD 32X</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">From 1994 to 1996, 34 games were released for the 32X. Though many were original titles, a significant number of these releases were slightly upgraded versions of existing Genesis games, such as <a href="../../mortal-kombat-ii/61-3571/" rel="nofollow">Mortal Kombat II</a> and <a href="../../nba-jam-tournament-edition/61-14792/" rel="nofollow">NBA Jam Tournament Edition</a>. In addition to these, Sega also produced five games that required both a 32X and a Sega CD, dubbed “Sega CD 32X” games.</p><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3909/303256-sega_neptune.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-303256" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.55641025641026" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:55.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3909/303256-sega_neptune.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-303256"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3909/303256-sega_neptune.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3909/303256-sega_neptune.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The prototype Neptune</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Game development for the 32X was slow as developers proceeded to move on to the 32bit <a href="/saturn/3045-42/" data-ref-id="3045-42">Sega Saturn</a>. Sales were dismal due to the lack of games, cost of add-ons, and confusion for consumers, over what they needed to play their games (Genesis/Genesis with 32X/Genesis with SegaCD/ or all three). In addition, upon the 32X's launch the Sega Saturn, Sega's true next generation system, was right around the corner. Despite Sega's assurance to the contrary, many consumers feared that Sega would drop support for the console in favor of it's 32 bit big brother.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Before the 32X was discontinued, Sega also planned a combined Genesis and 32X console called "Neptune" that never left the prototype stage.</p><h2>Launch</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">When launched during November of 1994 in North America and Europe, the 32X was positioned with a one year window before “Saturday” and the launch of the Sega Saturn.

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">After seeing how successful the gaming market was, <a href="/microsoft-game-studios/3010-340/" data-ref-id="3010-340">Microsoft</a> decided it was time to produce a home console; The Xbox (which originally was going to be called the DirectX-box) was released in North America on November 15, 2001, Japan on February 22, and Europe and Australia on March 14, 2002.</p><p style="">It was the direct competitor of the <a href="/gamecube/3045-23/" data-ref-id="3045-23">Nintendo GameCube</a> and the <a href="/playstation-2/3045-19/" data-ref-id="3045-19">PlayStation 2</a>. It was the first home console on the market to include an internal hard drive by default. This was a breakthrough at the time as it made games run faster that used the HDD and also allowed players to save their progress without the use of a Memory Card. The Xbox shipped with a custom made Intel processor based on the Intel III architecture.

Users were able to rip music from their CD collection and listen from the Xbox's hard drive. This also made custom in-game soundtracks possible. The first game to take advantage of this was <a href="/rockstar-games/3010-1194/" data-ref-id="3010-1194">Rockstar</a>'s <a href="/grand-theft-auto-double-pack/3030-21859/" data-ref-id="3030-21859">Grand Theft Auto Double Pack.</a> The Xbox was the first console to charge an annual fee to play online and introduced fully integrated online gaming on home consoles with the introduction of <a href="/xbox-live/3015-1404/" data-ref-id="3015-1404">Xbox Live</a>.</p><h2>Sales</h2><p style="">When the Xbox launched on November 21, 2001, the console quickly sold out in North America. In Japan, however, the console sold only 250,000 units. After its release in November 2004 Halo 2 became the best selling Xbox title worldwide, selling over 8 million copies, thanks in large part to the quality of its online multiplayer through Xbox Live. It was arguably the most popular online mutliplayer shooter on home consoles during the sixth-generation of consoles.</p><p style="">According to Microsoft the Xbox has sold over 24 million worldwide as of 2006.</p><h2>Support</h2><p style="">Microsoft officially no longer offers <a href="/">console repairs</a> on the Xbox after March 2, 2009. Microsoft is rumored to offer an Xbox 360 upgrade offer to users of the original Xbox. Real support for the Xbox ended on November 22, 2005 with the launch of the console's successor, the <a href="/xbox-360/3045-20/" data-ref-id="3045-20">Xbox 360</a>. <a href="/xbox-live/3015-1404/" data-ref-id="3015-1404">Xbox Live</a> support for the Xbox was discontinued for all Xbox original games on April 15th 2010.</p><h2>Technical Specifications</h2><h3>Dimensions</h3><p style="">320 x 100 x 260 mm (12.5 x 4 x 10.5 in)</p><h3>Weight</h3><p style="">2.4 kg (5 lbs. 5 oz.)</p><h3>Media</h3><p style="">2-5x DVD</p><p style="">10 GB hard disk</p><p style="">8 MB memory card</p><h3>Interfaces</h3><p style="">Controller port (4)</p><p style="">Memory Card slot (2)</p><p style="">AV Multi Out connector (1)</p><p style="">USB connector (2)</p><p style="">i.Link(TM (IEEE1394 connector)</p><h3>Features</h3><ul><li>An internal hard drive, for storage of game information -- a first in the console gaming industry.

      <deck><![CDATA[The N-Gage (later re-released as N-Gage QD) was a failed gaming platform developed by phone manufacturer Nokia. Games in MMC-Card format were sold for the platform, and towards the end, games were available for download to your own MMC. ]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">The N-Gage was a cellphone and handheld gaming platform, released by <a data-ref-id="3010-739" href="/nokia/3010-739/" slug="nokia">Nokia</a> in 2003. It was supposed to be a competitor to Nintendo's <a data-ref-id="3045-4" href="/game-boy-advance/3045-4/" slug="game-boy-advance">Gameboy Advance</a>, but was unsuccessful because of its clumsy design. Today the N-Gage brand is used for Nokia's mobile gaming service, available for the company's N-Series phones which is itself now obsolete. It had some big design flaws, that made the gaming and calling aspects of the phone clumsy.</p><h3>Criticisms:</h3><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/25966/2362590-11932_122303_006_super.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2362590" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/25966/2362590-11932_122303_006_super.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2362590"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/25966/2362590-11932_122303_006_super.jpg"></a><figcaption>Sidetalkin'</figcaption></figure><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15035/705190-ngage.gif" data-ref-id="1300-705190" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="1" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15035/705190-ngage.gif" data-ref-id="1300-705190"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15035/705190-ngage.gif"></a><figcaption>The original N-Gage</figcaption></figure><ul><li>The battery had to be removed to switch games.</li></ul><ul><li>The speaker and microphone was on the side of the phone. To make calls you had to hold the phone up to your head like a taco. This led to the internet meme of people "sidetalking".</li><li>The screen orientation was unusual for a gaming system (vertical instead of horizontal).</li></ul><h2>N-Gage QD</h2><p style="">The N-Gage QD was released six months after the original N-Gage, and improved many of the flaws found in the previous device. QD stands for "Quaque Die", which is Latin for "Every Day"</p><h3>Differences:</h3><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15035/705191-n_gage_qd_front_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-705191" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.66666666666667" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:66.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15035/705191-n_gage_qd_front_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-705191"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15035/705191-n_gage_qd_front_1.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15035/705191-n_gage_qd_front_1.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>N-Gage QD</figcaption></figure><ul><li>New revamped look.</li><li>Games could be switched without removing the battery.</li><li>The earpiece was moved to the front of the device.</li><li>No support for MP3 playback.</li></ul><h2>White screen of death</h2><p style="">The N gage QD also had a memory problem known as the white screen of death, the white screen of death became a serious problem with many users as it was easy to get the problem. The problem was that if the internal memory on the phone (3 MB) had been fully used up, then the phone would start using memory from the phones Ram. This meant that the phone would no longer have enough memory to start up the phone or even open the main menu to delete the files taking up the memory. Once this problem occurs if you turn off the N gage then it will no longer work, when turned back on the N gage would show a white screen and stay that way until the phone was switched off, now known as the white screen of death. Another problem with this was that there was and still isn't anyway to fix the N gage after getting the white screen of death, the only known way of fixing is for it to be sent to an official Nokia store.</p><h2>N-Gage Arena</h2><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19490/765403-1online.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-765403" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.1818181818182" data-width="176" style="width: 176px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:118.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19490/765403-1online.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-765403"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/19490/765403-1online.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/19490/765403-1online.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Tiger Woods fully supported online</figcaption></figure><p style="">The N-Gage also fully supported online play with some games, N-Gage arena allowed players to play against other people wherever they were, even with no wi-fi connectivity at all. However N-Gage Arena had problems, such as having to register with your network provider, which was a problem as some networks did not allow N gage Arena despite working on the N-Gage console. Arena also suffered from lag problems and slow down and was sadly never used by many players, meaning that the people who did play on N-Gage Arena could rarely find another player to play with, however Nokia still even today supports N-Gage Arena in some countries (such as UK) and still works just as well as it originally did.</p><p style="">N-Gage Arena was also used in some games as a global high score service. Some games, such as <a data-ref-id="3030-24133" href="/atari-masterpieces-vol-1/3030-24133/" slug="atari-masterpieces-vol-1">Atari Masterpieces Vol. 1</a> used this service so players could compare their scores with people from all over the world.</p><h2>N-Gage today</h2><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15035/705192-ngage_profile.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-705192" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.3060109289617" data-width="183" style="width: 183px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:130.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15035/705192-ngage_profile.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-705192"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15035/705192-ngage_profile.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15035/705192-ngage_profile.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The New N-Gage service</figcaption></figure><p style="">In 2008 Nokia released a mobile gaming service, under the N-Gage brand. The company dropped the idea of combining cellphones with handheld gaming devices, and chose to make N-gage a part of their Ovi internet services instead. This service is only available on certain Nokia smartphones running the company's S60 software platform, including several Nseries, Eseries and XpressMusic phones. The revamped N-gage service resembles Microsoft's <a data-ref-id="3015-1404" href="/xbox-live/3015-1404/" slug="xbox-live">Xbox Live</a>, with additions like N-Gage points, and gamer profiles.</p><p style="">With the N-Gage platform games are downloaded to the phone, and doesn't support the game cartridges the old N-gage system used. That means there is no backwards compatibility whatsoever. Several first generation N-gage games were ported over to the new platform. It was announced in October 2009 that the service would be shut down by the end of 2010.</p><h2>Nokia n85</h2><p style="">Nokia's most recent phone with a capacity comparing to the Android.</p><p style="">n85 Specs:</p><p style="">Dimensions</p><ul><li>Form: Two-way slider</li><li>Volume: 76 cc</li><li>Weight: 128 g</li><li>Dimensions: 103 × 50 × 16.0 mm</li></ul><p style="">Two-way slider with spring assistance mechanism</p><h3>Memory</h3><ul><li>microSD memory card slot, hot swappable, max. 32 GB (After firmware update)</li><li>128 MB internal dynamic memory</li><li>78 MB internal NAND flash memory</li></ul><h3>Data Network</h3><ul><li>HSDPA, maximum speed 3.6 Mbps (DL)</li><li>WCDMA 900/1900/2100, maximum speed PS 384/384 kbps (UL/DL)</li><li>EDGE class B, multislot class 32, maximum speed 296/177.6 kbps (DL/UL)</li><li>GPRS class A, multislot class 32, maximum speed 107/64.2 kbps (DL/UL)</li><li>HSCSD, maximum speed 43.2 kbit/s</li><li>CSD</li><li>WLAN 802.11b, 802.11g<ul><li>WLAN Security: WPA2-Enterprise, WPA2-Personal, WPA-Enterprise, WPA-Personal, WEP</li><li>WLAN Quality of Service: WMM, U-APSD</li><li>WLAN wizard</li></ul></li><li>TCP/IP support</li><li>Capability to serve as data modem</li></ul><h3>Display and User Interface</h3><ul><li>Size: 2.6"</li><li>Resolution: 320 × 240 pixels (QVGA)</li><li>Up to 16.7 million colours</li><li>Active Matrix OLED technology</li></ul><h3>Power Management</h3><ul><li>BL-5K 1200 mAh Li-Ion battery</li><li>Talk time (maximum):<ul><li>GSM 6.9 h</li><li>WCDMA 4.5 h</li><li>VoIP 6 h</li></ul></li><li>Standby time (maximum):<ul><li>GSM 363 h</li><li>WCDMA 363 h</li><li>WLAN 172 h</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Browsing time with packet data (maximum): 5 h 42 min</li><li>Video playback time (maximum): 7 h</li><li>Video recording time (maximum): 2 h 54 min</li><li>Video call time (maximum): 2 h 42 min</li><li>Gaming time (maximum): 7 h</li></ul><h3>Operating Frequency</h3><ul><li>Quad-band EGSM 850/900/1800/1900</li><li>WCDMA 2100/1900/850 (in the Americas) and 2100/1900/900 (everywhere else)</li><li>Automatic switching between WCDMA/GSM bands</li><li>Flight mode</li></ul><h3>Connectivity</h3><ul><li>Bluetooth version 2.0 with Enhanced Data Rate.</li><li>Bluetooth profiles:<ul><li>Dial Up Networking Profile (Gateway)</li><li>Object Push Profile (Server and Client)</li><li>File Transfer Profile (Server)</li><li>Hands Free Profile (Audio Gateway)</li><li>Headset Profile (Audio Gateway)</li><li>Basic Imaging Profile (Image Push Responder and Initiator)</li><li>Remote SIM Access Profile (Server)</li><li>Device Identification Profile</li><li>Phone Book Access Profile (Server)</li><li>Stereo Audio Streaming:</li><li>Generic Audio/Video Distribution Profile</li><li>Audio/Video Remote Control Profile (A/V Remote Control Target)</li><li>Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (Audio Source)</li></ul></li><li>Add-on solutions enable integration into enterprise private branch exchange (PBX) infrastructure</li><li>DLNA (Digital Living Network Alliance) certification</li><li>UPnP support</li><li>MTP (Mobile Transfer Protocol) support</li><li>TV out (PAL) with Nokia Video Connectivity Cable (CA-75U, in box inclusion may vary based on sales package configuration)</li><li>Nokia XpressPrint</li><li>Support for local and remote SyncML synchronization</li></ul>]]></description>

      <deck><![CDATA[The PlayStation 3 (often abbreviated PS3) is the third home video game console created and released by Sony Computer Entertainment Inc.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">The PlayStation 3 (PS3) was officially unveiled at <a href="../../sony-computer-entertainment-america/65-313/" rel="nofollow">Sony Computer Entertainment America's</a> Electronic Entertainment Expo press conference on May 16, 2005. When it was initially announced, Sony stated that it would be part of a longer cycle for consoles, stating that it would be part of a ten year cycle.</p><p style="">Sony initially announced two hardware configurations for the PlayStation 3: The 60GB and the 20GB, though the 40GB, 80GB, 120GB, 160GB, 250GB and 320GB configurations have been released since then. The PS3 was announced for a simultaneous worldwide release with a launch date of November 11, 2006 for Japan and November 17, 2006 for the United States and Europe. But due to a shortage of the blue laser diodes used for the Blu-ray Disc drive, the European launch was subsequently delayed to March 23, 2007.</p><p style="">The PS3 uses the Cell Broadband Engine co-developed by Sony, IBM, and Toshiba. Graphics processing is handled by the NVIDIA RSX 'Reality Synthesizer', which can output resolutions up to 1080p HD. The PS3 has 256 MB of XDR main memory and 256 MB of GDDR3 video memory for the RSX, for a total of 512 MB system memory.</p><p style="">Since its launch, the PS3 has a worldwide install base of over 80 million units.</p><h2>Launch</h2><p style="">The system was released in North America on November 17th, 2006 (November 11th in Japan, March 23rd in Europe). The launch of the PlayStation 3 proved to be a rather difficult one for many reasons. One was the high price point for the console; $599 for the 60GB model in the US. Another was the launch line-up and the infamous E3 2006 press conference which failed to impress gamers, and instead started many internet memes, like <a href="../../giant-enemy-crab/92-747/" rel="nofollow">Giant enemy crab</a> and <a href="/genji-days-of-the-blade/3030-15569/" data-ref-id="3030-15569">Massive damage</a>. Finally, the marketing campaign "Play B3yond" was negatively received for its approach and weirdness, mostly concerning a TV spot featuring a plastic baby, laughing and finally crying watching a PS3. The North American launch line-up was the following:</p><ul><li><a href="../../call-of-duty-3/61-7524/" rel="nofollow">Call of Duty 3</a></li><li><a href="../../genji-days-of-the-blade/61-15569/" rel="nofollow">Genji: Days of the Blade</a></li><li><a href="../../madden-nfl-07/61-16585/" rel="nofollow">Madden NFL 07</a></li><li><a href="../../marvel-ultimate-alliance/61-7527/" rel="nofollow">Marvel: Ultimate Alliance</a></li><li><a href="../../mobile-suit-gundam-crossfire/61-22513/" rel="nofollow">Mobile Suit Gundam: Crossfire</a></li><li><a href="../../nba-2k7/61-9829/" rel="nofollow">NBA 2K7</a></li><li><a href="../../nba-07/61-3557/" rel="nofollow">NBA 07</a></li><li><a href="../../need-for-speed-carbon/61-8844/" rel="nofollow">Need for Speed: Carbon</a></li><li><a href="../../nhl-2k7/61-21700/" rel="nofollow">NHL 2K7</a></li><li><a href="../../resistance-fall-of-man/61-9741/" rel="nofollow">Resistance: Fall of Man</a></li><li><a href="../../ridge-racer-7/61-1101/" rel="nofollow">Ridge Racer 7</a></li><li><a href="../../tiger-woods-pga-tour-07/61-67/" rel="nofollow">Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07</a></li><li><a href="../../tony-hawks-project-8/61-12077/" rel="nofollow">Tony Hawk's Project 8</a></li><li><a href="../../untold-legends-dark-kingdom/61-13294/" rel="nofollow">Untold Legends: Dark Kingdom</a></li></ul><h2>Hardware Configurations</h2><h3>20 GB Model (discontinued)</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15553/820249-playstation_3.png" data-ref-id="1300-820249" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.69" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:69.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15553/820249-playstation_3.png" data-ref-id="1300-820249"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15553/820249-playstation_3.png"></a><figcaption>The Original PlayStation 3 ( non 20gb model)</figcaption></figure><p style="">The 20 GB was available at launch in Japan on November 11th 2006, in North America on November 17th 2006.The 20 GB PS3 has a slot loading 2x speed Blu-ray Disc drive that plays Blu-ray movies, DVDs, CDs, and SACDs. It has built-in Bluetooth 2.0, a Gigabit Ethernet port, 4 USB 2.0 ports, and HDMI 1.3a. The 20GB PS3 also has backwards compatibility with PlayStation 1 &amp; 2 titles through hardware emulation. The 20GB PS3 had an MSRP of $499.99 USD. It was discontinued on April 11th, 2007 due to poor sales compared to the 60 GB.</p><h3>60 GB Model (discontinued)</h3><p style="">The 60GB PS3 was launched in Japan on November 11th 2006, then in North America on November 17th 2006. It has all of the features of the 20GB model plus 802.11b/g Wi-Fi, a multiple flash card reader, and a chrome finish. The original MSRP was $599.99. It was discontinued on July 13th, 2007.</p><h3>60 GB Model PAL (discontinued)</h3><p style="">The PS3 launched with a 60 GB model in Europe on March 23rd 2007. An important difference between the European and American 60 GB model was the backwards compatibility. Unlike the American version, PlayStation 2 backwards compatibility was carried out via hardware and software emulation, foreshadowing the eventual 80GB model. The RRP of this model was €599.</p><h3>80 GB Model (PS2 backwards compatible, discontinued)</h3><p style=""><b>In</b> August 2007, Sony released an 80 GB model of the PS3 in the US, which included backwards compatibility. This was enabled by using software emulation to emulate PS2 games. Because, it was software based, it only allowed for ~60% of PS2 titles to be played with no issues.</p><h3>40 GB Model (discontinued)</h3><p style="">The 40 GB PS3 was launched in Europe/Australia in October 2007 and North America/Japan in November 2007. The 40 GB model had the multiple flash card reader and SACD supported removed, and is not backwards compatible with PlayStation 2 titles but is still compatible with original PlayStation titles. The 40 GB PS3 had a MSRP of $399.99. For a limited time only, Spider-Man 3 was packaged along with the 40 GB model.</p><h3>80 GB Model (discontinued)</h3><p style="">Another 80 GB PS3 was launched in August 2008 in North American and Japan in October 2008. It sports all of the features of the 40 GB model and has an MSRP of $399.99 . At Sony's Gamescom 2009 keynote, Kaz Harai announced that the standard PS3 pricepoint is to be reduced by $100 to $299.99 as of August 19, which at the time applied to both this and the 160 GB model.</p><h3>160 GB Model (discontinued)</h3><p style="">The 160 GB PS3 was announced at the Leipzig Games Convention in August 2008. The model will be coming to North America in November as part of a bundle which includes <a href="../../uncharted-drakes-fortune/61-13992/" rel="nofollow">Uncharted: Drake's Fortune</a>, a voucher for a free download of <a href="../../pain/61-18059/" rel="nofollow">PAIN</a> and a DualShock 3 for $499.99. This model will be released in Europe on October 31 for the cost of €499 RRP ($628) but will be packed with €70 ($88) worth of additional DLC.</p><h3>E3 Model (never released)</h3><p style="">Interestingly enough, the original model shown off at the Electronic Expo in 2005 boasted a couple of different features. The original planned configuration was to have at least 2 HDMI ports and up to 6 USB ports (2 ports on the back). This was later cut down to four for the launch and the HDMI ports cut down to one, with the reasoning being that there was actually no need for so many ports. It was shown in three different colors; white, silver, and piano black, but only black was available for launch. It was also sporting the now infamous boomerang controller, but that design was scrapped in favor of the more traditional DualShock design.</p><h3>Slim 120 GB Model (discontinued)</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4941/1109735-ps311.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1109735" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.792" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:79.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4941/1109735-ps311.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1109735"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4941/1109735-ps311.jpg"></a><figcaption>The PlayStation 3 Slim</figcaption></figure><p style="">The Slim 120 GB model of the PS3 was announced at Gamescom 2009 by Kaz Harai at Sony's keynote on August 18. The new model is 33% smaller and 36% lighter, and consumes 34% less power. The Slim shares mostly the same features as the most recent SKU's. The one notable exception, however, is that the ability to install a second operating system was removed. Also, there was a stand introduced to support it when vertically oriented, similar to the PS2 Slim, though it has been shown to be unnecessary. This model was released on September 1, 2009 at an MSRP of $299.99 in the U.S., £249.99 in the U.K. and €299.99 in the rest of Europe.</p><h3>Slim 250 GB Model (discontinued)</h3><p style="">This is identical to the 120 GB model except for hard drive capacity, and it retailed for $349.99 when released on November 3, 2009 in the U.S. There was also a white <a href="../../final-fantasy-xiii/61-20664/" rel="nofollow">Final Fantasy XIII</a> bundle in Japan released on December 17.</p><h3>Slim 160 GB Model</h3><p style="">This is identical to the 120 GB model except for hard drive capacity, and it retailed for $299.99 when released in August 2010 in the U.S.</p><h3>Slim 320 GB Model</h3><p style="">This is identical to the 120 GB model except for hard drive capacity, and it retailed for $349.99 when released on September 19, 2010 in the U.S. This system also comes as a PlayStation Move bundle, including the game <a href="/sports-champions/3030-30349/" data-ref-id="3030-30349">Sports Champions</a>.</p><h3>"Super Slim" 250GB Model</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56742/2327427-ps3_ss.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2327427" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.75245901639344" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56742/2327427-ps3_ss.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2327427"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/5/56742/2327427-ps3_ss.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/5/56742/2327427-ps3_ss.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>PS3 "Super Slim"</figcaption></figure><p style="">Announced at <a href="/tokyo-game-show-2012/3015-7504/" data-ref-id="3015-7504">TGS 2012</a> and released on September 25 in North America, the PS3 "Super Slim" is the 3rd and most likely final version of the PS3. it's less than half the size and weight of the original PS3 and 20 percent less volume and 25 percent less weight of the Slim PS3.

It charges its built-in lithium ion battery via USB cable and has a battery life of roughly thirty hours fully charged. It connects to the system via Bluetooth and lacks any sort of rumble function. Originally, Sony's reason for this was that they found the motion control functions of the controller to be more immersive than the rumble function and they were technically unable to combine them at the time. Although it is more likely due to the lawsuit from Immersion. The two games that were used to demonstrate the motion capabilities of the system were <a href="../../lair/61-9387/" rel="nofollow">Lair</a> and <a href="../../warhawk/61-20458/" rel="nofollow">Warhawk</a>.</p><h3>DualShock 3</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10024/846159-309638_dualshock_3_super.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-846159" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.54804270462633" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:54.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10024/846159-309638_dualshock_3_super.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-846159"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10024/846159-309638_dualshock_3_super.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10024/846159-309638_dualshock_3_super.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>DualShock 3</figcaption></figure><p style="">At its press conference at the 2007 Tokyo Game Show, Sony announced the <a href="../../dualshock-3/59-29/" rel="nofollow">DualShock 3</a> because despite Sony's original belief that the controller didn't need rumble, the fans asked. This was a PlayStation 3 controller with the same function and design as the Sixaxis, but with the vibration capability included. It has a lithium ion battery as well with a battery life of roughly 25 hours, and it charges via USB. Similarly to the Sixaxis, this controller connects to the PlayStation system via Bluetooth. Because of the added functionality of the rumble, the controller weighs more then it's older brother.</p><h3>Official PlayStation Bluetooth Headset</h3><h3>The official Sony PS3 headset</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7025/870952-sony_playstation_3_bluetooth_headset.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-870952" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.71489361702128" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:71.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7025/870952-sony_playstation_3_bluetooth_headset.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-870952"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7025/870952-sony_playstation_3_bluetooth_headset.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7025/870952-sony_playstation_3_bluetooth_headset.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">This headset is compatible with cellphones and the PS3.

The AC adapter retails in the United States for $24.99 and the United Kingdom for £19.99.</p><h3>PS3 sound bar</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56742/1794741-5076290973_37d42947f5_b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1794741" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.7919921875" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:79.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56742/1794741-5076290973_37d42947f5_b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1794741"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/5/56742/1794741-5076290973_37d42947f5_b.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/5/56742/1794741-5076290973_37d42947f5_b.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Released in October, 2010, with a MSRP of $179.99, the official PS3 sound bar is a 2.1 channel audio device that mimics surround sound systems.

A sub-controller was also revealed, dubbed the "Navigation Controller."

Branching off from the traditional game pad controller from Nintendo's previous consoles, the Wii features a wireless controller, referred to as the Wii Remote, which is used as a handheld pointing device and detects movement in three dimensions. Although the console was unveiled earlier in the year at the <i>Electronic Entertainment Expo</i>, the Wii Remote was not shown until the <i>Tokyo Game Show</i> in September of that year.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The Wii launched in <a href="../../north-america/95-1664/" rel="nofollow">North America</a> on November 19, 2006, December 2, 2006 in <a href="../../japan/95-37/" rel="nofollow">Japan</a> and on December 8, 2006 in Europe. Since its launch, the console has sold over 50 million consoles as of March 2009. The Wii has been infamous for its limited availability, and people have complained about how few consoles can be found in stores. According to Nintendo, they are making nearly one million Wii consoles per month, however. The Wii continues Nintendo's tradition of choosing lower specifications of hardware components to be able to gain a profit off the hardware alone. Where their competitors are willing to lose money upfront off the hardware sales and make up for the loss with software and subscription based revenues.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Originally, the console was known as the 'Nintendo Revolution', a code name to explain Nintendo's plans with the console. When it was unveiled, it was dark black, but upon its release it had changed to a white and blue color scheme. The name <i>Wii</i> has had many official explanations.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Nintendo stated that the plural form of Wii is, contrary to popular belief, not "Wiis." Instead, it is "Wii consoles" or "Wii systems." The two i's in Wii are meant to represent two players standing next to each other, or the Wii Remote and Nunchuk. One explanation for the name is as follows:</p><blockquote><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0"><i>"Wii sounds like 'we,' which emphasizes that the console is for everyone. Wii can easily be remembered by people around the world, no matter what language they speak. No confusion. No need to abbreviate. Just Wii."</i></p></blockquote><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The Wii has been criticized for disrupting the way game publishers have been doing business for years. The ease for game publishers to release games on the platform caused a lot of competition in the Wii market, where normally very popular types of games in other systems would fail to become popular on the Wii. However, the Wii became one of the best selling video game systems ever made, breaking records worldwide, including the best selling video game system in Europe, as well as many of it's games going on to become the best selling videogames of all time.</p><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/106575/2204650-wiislim.png" data-ref-id="1300-2204650" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.56218057921635" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/106575/2204650-wiislim.png" data-ref-id="1300-2204650"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/10/106575/2204650-wiislim.png"></a><figcaption>The "Family Edition" Wii Model</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">In December 2011 Nintendo discontinued the launch model of the Wii and released a "Slim" version of the Wii in Europe. No specific reason is given by Nintendo for this re-release. The "Slim" Wii has the same specifications as the launch model with the exception for <a href="/gamecube/3045-23/" data-ref-id="3045-23">GameCube</a> support, resulting in no support for GameCube games and the lack of GameCube controller ports and GameCube memory card slots. The console launched in the colors black and white and is bundled with a <a href="/wii-motionplus/3000-25/" data-ref-id="3000-25">Wii MotionPlus</a>, <a href="/wii-sports/3030-13328/" data-ref-id="3030-13328">Wii Sports</a> and <a href="/wii-party/3030-31210/" data-ref-id="3030-31210">Wii Party</a>.

primary controller for the console. The controller communicates with the console using Bluetooth technology and features rumble vibration and an internal speaker. The Wii Nunchuck unit also features an accelerometer with an added traditional analog stick with two trigger buttons. By using the Wii Remote, users can control the game using physical movements as well as traditional button presses</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The body of the Wii Remote measures 148 mm long, 36.2 mm wide, and 30.8 mm thick (5.83 in x 1.43 in x 1.21 in).

In games where you use the remote horizontally, they are often used as "A and B" buttons.</li><li>The plus and minus buttons, located in the middle of the remote, are usually used to bring up menus.</li><li>The home button is located in between the plus and minus buttons, and brings up a menu that allows you to go to the Wii Menu, reset your console, or edit Wii Remote menus.</li><li>A power button is located in the top left corner of the remote.</li><li>The "B" trigger is located on the back of the Wii Remote, and is generally used to return to previous menus, or to fire weapons in

It is designed to operate with "channels" on a television. Each square is a "channel" that has a different function. Channels have been added since the six available at launch, and periodical updates are available for the Wii Menu. The Wii Menu is navigated via the Wii Remote, and channels can be moved (with the exception of the Disc Channel) by holding down the A and B buttons and then dragging the channel.</p><h3>Wii Menu Updates</h3><ul><li><b>Wii Menu 4.0</b></li></ul><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">GDC 2009 Nintendo revealed the "complete storage solution for the Wii." This storage solution is included in the new Wii Menu 4.0, which features an SD card icon in the bottom left, next to the Wii circle. Clicking on the icon brings you to the SD card menu, where up to 20 screens are fillable. Games can be downloaded to and launched directly from an SD or SDHC card without going through the Wii System Memory menus. The 4.0 update also enabled SD cards above the 2 GB capacity.</p><h3>Main Wii Channels</h3><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/809819-dmenu.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-809819" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.91666666666667" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:91.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/809819-dmenu.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-809819"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/809819-dmenu.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/809819-dmenu.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Wii Menu</figcaption></figure><ul><li><b>Disc Channel</b> - The default channel that is used to play games. When a disc is loaded in (either Wii or GameCube), the two discs spin around, eventually stop, and then one falls down as if it is being loaded in a slot. Then, the game's splash screen appears, and the player has the option to either play the game or return to the Wii Menu screen.</li><li><b>Mii Channel</b> - Another default channel, the Mii Channel is used to design custom avatars known as Miis. Players can customize many aspects of their virtual avatar. The Mii interactivity is one of the frequently advertised parts of the Wii.</li><li><b>Photo Channel</b> - Players can upload pictures and videos through use of an SD card or from received messages on the Wii message board, and then use various effects to alter the image. Sound files .MP3, .AAC, and .M4A are also compatible with the channel, so the user can play a slideshow accompanied by music. The Photo Channel's icon in the Wii Menu can be customized with a picture.</li><li><b>Wii Shop Channel</b> - The <a href="../../wii-shop/60-87/" rel="nofollow">Wii Shop Channel</a> is a channel that allows users to purchase games. It is divided into three categories: <a href="../../virtual-console/92-2925/" rel="nofollow">Virtual Console</a>, <a href="../../wiiware/92-2695/" rel="nofollow">WiiWare</a>, and Wii Channels. Games can be purchased on the Virtual Console that have been released in previous generations, from a variety of consoles. WiiWare consists of small-budget games that have been released by amateur developers wanting to get a name, or sometimes larger companies releasing games not big enough for a retail release. Wii Points must be purchased to buy any games on this channel, which can be bought in increments of 1000 ($10.00 USD) on the channel itself, or in various retail stores (Nintendo Points).</li><li><b>Forecast Channel</b> - Users navigate a large 3D world to find weather forecasts for their area. By merely clicking on the channel, however, users can see a quick forecast if WiiConnect24 is on. Some games use the information from the Forecast Channel to change the in-game weather (such as <a href="../../madden-nfl-07/61-16585/" rel="nofollow">Madden NFL 07</a> and <a href="../../nights-journey-of-dreams/61-4161/" rel="nofollow">NiGHTS: Journey of Dreams</a>).</li><li><b>News Channel</b> - The News Channel allows users to view headlines from various current events. The news articles are from the Associated Press, and are available in a variety of languages. The news headlines are available in many different categories, and they are automatically updated as news comes in.</li><li><b>Internet Channel</b> - The Internet Channel is a browser for the Wii based on the Opera browser. Originally, it was free, but it is now available for a one time payment of 500 Wii Points ($5.00 USD), although users who downloaded it for free do not have to pay. The browser has USB keyboard compatibility and supports many of the same standards as the Opera browser available for computers.</li><li><b>Everybody Votes Channel</b> - The Everybody Votes Channel is a channel where users vote in a variety of opinion polls. All questions are created by Nintendo, based off of submitted user questions. You can track your stats, such as your "distance from popular opinion", and good you are at predicting the popular answer. A map showing how ones specific country votes is also available to users.</li><li><b>Check Mii Out Channel</b> - The Check Mii Out Channel allows users to upload and download others' Miis and share them to users around the world. There are also themed contests designed by Nintendo, where each user can submit a Mii and vote on their favorites from all the entries.</li><li><b>Nintendo Channel</b> - The Nintendo Channel is essentially a preview of upcoming and recently released Wii and Nintendo <a href="../../nintendo-ds/60-52/" rel="nofollow">DS</a> games. There are a variety of trailers to watch and browse, including videos of core gameplay and promotional videos. Nintendo DS game demos can be downloaded via this channel as well, turning your Wii into something similar to a DS-download station.</li></ul><figure style="width: 155px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3715/874945-logo_wiiware.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-874945" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.72258064516129" data-width="155" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:72.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3715/874945-logo_wiiware.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-874945"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3715/874945-logo_wiiware.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3715/874945-logo_wiiware.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Original WiiWare Channel Image</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">There also have been a few channels made available only in Japan: Television Friend Channel (Terebi no Tomo Channel), Digicam Print Channel, Fortune Telling Channel (Kyou to Ashita no Uranai Lucky Channel), and Wii no Ma (see below).

      <deck><![CDATA[The Dreamcast is the fifth and final console developed by Sega and the first of the sixth-generation of consoles to release.

It is famous for being the first console to include worldwide online capability, its game library, and its unexpectedly short life span.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">The Sega Dreamcast is a 128-bit console released in 1998 and the successor to the <a href="/saturn/3045-42/" data-ref-id="3045-42">Sega Saturn</a>. The Dreamcast was based on the powerful Sega Naomi <a href="/arcade/3045-84/" data-ref-id="3045-84">arcade</a> system (released 1998), the successor to the Sega Model 3 arcade system (released 1996). The Dreamcast uses a Hitachi CPU processor, the first with a 128-bit vector graphics engine, along with an <a href="/nec-home-electronics-ltd/3010-2708/" data-ref-id="3010-2708">NEC</a> GPU graphics processor. It had a new disc format in the shape of the GD-ROM; these discs held up to 1.2 gigabytes of data, considerably more than a <a href="/compact-disc/3055-2133/" data-ref-id="3055-2133">Compact Disc</a>. The Dreamcast was <a href="/sega/3010-62/" data-ref-id="3010-62">Sega</a>'s last entry to the console hardware market as their support for the console ended as early as 2001, less than two years after the <a href="/the-united-states-of-america/3035-396/" data-ref-id="3035-396">US </a>launch, and is largely attributed to the arrival of the hotly anticipated and wildly successful <a href="/playstation-2/3045-19/" data-ref-id="3045-19">PS2</a>. Despite its tragically short life, the Dreamcast is held in high regard by nostalgic fans for the raft of superb exclusive titles released in that time.</p><h2>History</h2><h3>1995 - 1998: Before the Dreamcast</h3><p style="">The <a href="/saturn/3045-42/" data-ref-id="3045-42">Saturn</a> originated in 1995 at the first <a href="/e3-1995/3015-3482/" data-ref-id="3015-3482">E3</a>. Since Sony's arrival in the game hardware market, their rivals began playing a major defensive against the juggernaut that was the PlayStation. The growing popularity of the <a href="/playstation/3045-22/" data-ref-id="3045-22">PlayStation</a> brought a lot of support from <a href="/japan/3035-37/" data-ref-id="3035-37">Japan</a>, and the <a href="/saturn/3045-42/" data-ref-id="3045-42">Saturn</a> began to slip behind in sales. Due to this, Sega began to fear that Sony would gain momentous support in the US and would leave them lagging seriously behind. In order to keep up, Sega made a marketing decision, which has infamously become widely considered to be a historic mistake in its battle for supremacy.</p><p style="">At E3, Sega announced that the Saturn was released the same day as the press conference in the US. Their strategy was to release the console early so they could get a strong base before Sony released their console in September. This plan backfired due to the anger of developers and retailers. Many developers were mad because they wanted their games to be released with the Saturn's launch, and many popular retailers (like Wal-Mart and KB Toys) were so angry for lack of information that most considered not selling any more Sega consoles in their stores. The Saturn sold 80,000 units before the PlayStation launched, but the PlayStation sold over 100,000 units during its first week, making Sega's strategy a failure. Even though the Saturn was managing to keep up in Japan, it completely bombed in the US. The only territory where the Saturn had any success was Japan, where it was Sega's most successful console in its home country.</p><p style="">Overseas, however, things did not get better for Sega over the next two years. At <a href="/e3-1997/3015-3419/" data-ref-id="3015-3419">E3 1997</a>, <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/bernard-stolar/3040-33719/" data-ref-id="3040-33719">Bernie Stolar</a> announced "The Saturn is not our future". This announcement, for all intensive purposes, killed the Saturn's overseas chances, and made people even more angry because of this. Thus, Sega began work on a new console.</p><h3>Development</h3><p style="">The company wanted to create a truly next-generation console, with features ahead of its time and far superior hardware to that of the popular PlayStation as well as the Nintendo 64. As a result, the Dreamcast, based on the powerful Sega Naomi arcade system, was the first console to truly offer <a href="/arcade/3045-84/" data-ref-id="3045-84">arcade</a>-quality <a href="/polygonal-3d/3015-1430/" data-ref-id="3015-1430">3D graphics</a>, considerably more powerful than any other home system when it launched in 1998.</p><p style="">Unfortunately, the desire to get the Dreamcast moving quickly and have a fast production process may have eventually led to its demise, since, as the technology behind it being considerable powerful for a 1998 system, it was far too expensive to produce, forcing Sega to sell it at a loss. In addition, this may have put it at a mid-way point between generations, competing against the much weaker <a href="/playstation/3045-22/" data-ref-id="3045-22">Playstation</a> and <a href="/nintendo-64/3045-43/" data-ref-id="3045-43">N64</a> in its early years, before eventually competing against the <a href="/playstation-2/3045-19/" data-ref-id="3045-19">PS2</a> which had comparable graphical capabilities (though both consoles were weaker than the <a href="/xbox/3045-32/" data-ref-id="3045-32">Xbox</a> and <a href="/gamecube/3045-23/" data-ref-id="3045-23">Gamecube</a> by 2001).</p><p style="">There were initially two competing models of the Dreamcast. Tatsuo Yamamoto of IBM Austin was to lead a team of eleven developing the "Black Belt" version of the console, which was to have a Hitachi SH4 processor and a 3dfx Voodoo 2 graphics chip. At various stages in development, the US model was nicknamed "Shark" and "Dural". Meanwhile, the Japanese hardware team led by Hideki Sato settled on the same processor, but a PowerVR2 graphics chip created by VideoLogic and manufactured by NEC. This "White Belt" version was nicknamed "Guppy" and "Katana" before the name Dreamcast was decided. The Japanese model was chosen in Summer 1997 because 3dfx had unwittingly leaked its entire contract with Sega in April, who had been keeping the project a secret. 3dfx filed a lawsuit against Sega for breach of contract, but this was settled out of court.</p><h3>Success</h3><p style="">On November 27, 1998, The <a href="/sega/3010-62/" data-ref-id="3010-62">Sega</a> Dreamcast launched in Japan. The console was in high demand throughout the region, causing it to sell out in all stores during its first few weeks of launch. It was selling so well that Sega couldn't keep up with the demand. According to reports, NEC was unable to create enough processors for the Dreamcast so Sega was unable to make as many consoles as they would liked.</p><p style="">Seeing how successful the Dreamcast had done in Japan, Sega began work on an American release. Sega of America was hard at work on getting buzz for the American Dreamcast launch. Sega even created their own holiday called "Dreamcast Day", set for September 9, 1999, burning 9-9-99 into everyone's memory as the day they'd get to experience the next generation of gaming for the first time. The subsequent European release date was on October 14, 1999.</p><p style="">The Dreamcast continued to sell well in North America until 2000. In fact, the Dreamcast even managed to <a href="http://www.netinst.org/Clements_Ohashi.pdf" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">outsell the PS2 in North America</a> in 2000 (possibly due to PS2 shortages), shortly before the console was discontinued. However, this was not enough to resolve the problems Sega were facing, as outlined below.</p><h3>Downfall</h3><p style="">At <a href="/e3-1999/3015-3421/" data-ref-id="3015-3421">E3 1999</a>, Sega was showing the Dreamcast and its games to the American market. However, Sega's biggest threat, Sony, unveiled the Playstation 2, showing the complete layout and design of the console. From what Sony showed, it was clear that the Playstation 2 was a more powerful system in comparison to the Dreamcast. Due to this, consumers decided to skip the Dreamcast and wait for the PS2 to come out. These turn of events began to shake the foundation of the Dreamcast.</p><p style="">Even though the PS2 had the most attention at that moment, the Dreamcast had a successful launch, selling 300,000 pre-orders, which was more than the original Playstation. The Dreamcast had a vast variety of launch games like <a href="/sonic-adventure/3030-7852/" data-ref-id="3030-7852">Sonic Adventure</a>, <a href="/soul-calibur/3030-12411/" data-ref-id="3030-12411">Soul Calibur</a>, and <a href="/nfl-2k2/3030-14001/" data-ref-id="3030-14001">NFL 2K</a>. For a while it seemed that Sega would continue to be a competitor in the gaming market.</p><p style="">Then in March of 2000, Sony released the PS2 worldwide to considerable hype. One major plus that the PS2 had was the game console doubled as a DVD player. Back then, DVDs weren't popular because standalone DVD players were too expensive for the average consumer. Since the PS2 was less expensive than a stand alone DVD player, the PS2 sold very well and helped boost the DVD platform. There were instances reported where people didn't even buy the console for games (the launch didn't have as many good games as the Dreamcast), and solely used the console for the DVD player functionality. To show support of this, the best selling item for the PS2 in Japan was the Matrix DVD. This made the PS2 look more like an entertainment device than an actual console. Since the Dreamcast couldn't play DVDs, people overlooked the system and Dreamcast consoles were beginning to sit on shelves.</p><p style="">One other problem the Dreamcast had was copious amounts of pirating. Because of the Dreamcast's poor copy protection, it was easy for people to copy games onto regular CD-ROM's and have the console recognize them as actual games. Because of this, game sales were decreasing.</p><p style="">Despite the considerable hype for the PS2, the Dreamcast in fact managed to <a href="http://www.netinst.org/Clements_Ohashi.pdf" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">outsell the PS2 in North America</a> (possibly due to PS2 shortages) in 2000. However, this was not enough to make up for the losses in both hardware (selling at a loss) and software sales (much of which was being pirated), sealing the fate of Sega.</p><p style="">Sega got some relief when Sony was only able to sell half their inventory of PS2 consoles. Since the PS2's inventory was so weak, Sega decided to take action and try to move mass quantities of units. Unfortunately, this plan backfired as well.</p><p style="">In March 2001, <a href="/peter-moore/3040-14816/" data-ref-id="3040-14816">Peter Moore</a> (the head of Sega of America at the time) announced that the Dreamcast hadn't been meeting expectations. The sales had been sadly lagging and their warehouses were filled with unsold Dreamcast consoles and games. Sega decided to sell off the remaining number of consoles at a vastly discounted price and cut their losses. As part of this restructuring Sega announced that the Dreamcast would be discontinued and that they would exit the hardware business. Furthermore they would also be porting several of their key Dreamcast exclusives to rival platforms.</p><p style="">The change was meant to happen slowly with Sega continuing to release software for the system into 2002. However with Sega games now on other platforms third parties weren't all that thrilled to be supporting it. By fall of 2001 the new game output was dismal with only a handful of exclusives, most of which tanked and were never heard from again.</p><h2>Hardware</h2><p style="">Back in 1998, the Dreamcast was an advanced console for its time, surpassing the capabilities of all other consoles available at the time of its release and being the first 128-bit console to be released. The console has 4 controller slots and a 56k modem built into the console for Seganet. A broadband adapter for a faster connection was also available for $50, allowing the Dreamcast to be connected to an ethernet network.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/121177/1680286-dc_acc_broadband.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1680286" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="1.0815789473684" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:108.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/121177/1680286-dc_acc_broadband.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1680286"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/121177/1680286-dc_acc_broadband.jpg"></a><figcaption>Broadband Adapter for the Sega Dreamcast</figcaption></figure><p style="">The Dreamcast supported multiple television connections. It shipped with standard A/V cables, and S-video, component RGB cables, and an RF connector were available separately. In addition, Sega released a VGA adapter that allowed the Dreamcast to be played on a computer monitor at a resolution of 640x480, four times the standard resolution. Certain games could not be played through the VGA adapter, however.</p><p style="">This console runs GD-Roms which could hold up to 1.2 GBs of space. It also uses VMU memory cards that could hold up to 128 KB of space. These VMUs connect to your Dreamcast controller and have an LCD screen that shows pictures relating to the game that you're playing. For some games, minigames relating to the games are saved onto the VMU which could be played without the use of the Dreamcast, making it a handheld console as well.</p><h2>Accessories</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/121177/1680273-samba.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1680273" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.8" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/121177/1680273-samba.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1680273"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/121177/1680273-samba.jpg"></a><figcaption>Samba de Amigo Maracas</figcaption></figure><p style="">The Dreamcast had a lot of accessories.

For the <a href="/sonic-the-hedgehog/3025-383/" data-ref-id="3025-383">Sonic</a> fans, there was <a href="/sonic-adventure/3030-7852/" data-ref-id="3030-7852">Sonic Adventure</a>, which was Sega's first successful attempt into bring Sonic's gameplay to 3D. For the fighting fanatics, there was <a href="/soul-calibur/3030-12411/" data-ref-id="3030-12411">Soul Calibur</a>, which was a 3D fighter (similar to <a href="/tekken/3030-10081/" data-ref-id="3030-10081">Tekken</a>) that uses swords as their main weapons. This game became a big success, scoring 10's from many game reviewers (IGN and Gamespot) and is considered to be the superior version in comparison to the arcade game. For sports fans, there was <a href="/nfl-2k/3030-4659/" data-ref-id="3030-4659">NFL 2K</a>, the football title. When EA announced that they would not develop for the Dreamcast due to the failure of the Saturn, this caused Sega to make their own sports titles. NFL 2K was the Dreamcast's answer to <a href="/madden-nfl/3025-491/" data-ref-id="3025-491">Madden</a> and also made other sports titles for the <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/nba-2k/3025-498/" data-ref-id="3025-498">NBA</a> and <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/nhl-2k/3025-473/" data-ref-id="3025-473">NHL</a> as well as <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/virtua-tennis/3030-10676/" data-ref-id="3030-10676">Virtua Tennis</a>, their own tennis game. Later installments would include online play.</p><p style="">Due to a lack of third party support, Sega focused on their first party titles. Sega would continue to release their 2K sports line and would add online play to the 2K1 installments. Sega ported many of their popular arcade games over to the Dreamcast like <a href="/crazy-taxi/3030-9112/" data-ref-id="3030-9112">Crazy Taxi</a> and <a href="/the-house-of-the-dead/3030-508/" data-ref-id="3030-508">House of the Dead</a>. Along with their arcade games came their original, innovative titles for the platform. One of them was <a href="/samba-de-amigo/3030-16519/" data-ref-id="3030-16519">Samba de Amigo</a>, a rhythm game where you use a controller shaped like Maracas to move your arms around to meet a certain position. <a href="/space-channel-5/3030-7466/" data-ref-id="3030-7466">Space Channel 5</a> was another rhythm game where you go around space killing aliens while dancing to pop music. <a href="/chuchu-rocket/3030-13715/" data-ref-id="3030-13715">Chu Chu Rocket</a> was a puzzle game where you lead a group of mice away from cats.</p><p style="">Although the Dreamcast didn't have a high amount of third party support, the people who did develop for the system released top-notched games. The biggest company to do this was <a href="/capcom/3010-367/" data-ref-id="3010-367">Capcom</a>. Capcom was well known for its fighters released for the Dreamcast. They would make definitive home ports of their popular arcade fighters ( <a href="/marvel-vs-capcom/3025-513/" data-ref-id="3025-513">Marvel vs. Capcom</a> <a href="/marvel-vs-capcom-clash-of-super-heroes/3030-8605/" data-ref-id="3030-8605">1</a> and <a href="/marvel-vs-capcom-2-new-age-of-heroes/3030-2612/" data-ref-id="3030-2612">2</a>) along with releasing brand new fighters exclusive for the console ( <a href="/power-stone/3030-20100/" data-ref-id="3030-20100">Power Stone</a>).</p><p style="">The biggest game released for the Dreamcast was <a href="/shenmue/3030-7812/" data-ref-id="3030-7812">Shenmue</a>. It was in development since the Sega Saturn and was made by <a href="/yu-suzuki/3040-15149/" data-ref-id="3040-15149">Yu Suzuki</a>. It was considered to be the most expensive game (costing $70 million) and the most graphically superior game at the time. The game added some new elements like free-roaming gameplay and time-based gameplay. It was hyped to be the killer app for the Dreamcast that would ruin the PS2. When the game was first released in 2001, it came with mixed reviews. Some game reviewers loved the game, giving it 9's and 10's. They consider it a gaming achievement with its deep story and innovative gameplay. Others completely hated the game, giving it low scores. They complained about the slow gameplay and cheesy voice acting. Due to the mixed reviews, the game sold poorly. A <a href="/shenmue-ii/3030-1187/" data-ref-id="3030-1187">sequel</a> was released in Japan for the Dreamcast in 2001, but it never came to the US. In 2002, Sega made a deal with Microsoft to release the sequel for the Xbox in 2002.</p><h2>Online</h2><p style="">The Dreamcast was the first console to have fully functioning online play. The system came with a 56K modem and for families who didn't have an ISP Sega created the Seganet service (although players with an ISP already could use their own).</p><p style="">Although online play wasn't available untill fall of 2000, players could surf and browse the web through the console from day one. Some games even offered a rudimentry form of downloadable content. In Sonic Adventure, for instance players could download holiday themes for levels.</p><h2>Legacy</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/121177/1680287-dreamcast_logo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1680287" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/121177/1680287-dreamcast_logo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1680287"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/121177/1680287-dreamcast_logo.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/121177/1680287-dreamcast_logo.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Dreamcast</figcaption></figure><p style="">Even though the Dreamcast was discontinued prematurely, the legacy of the console lives on. Due to the Dreamcast failing, Sega had to drop from the console race and begin to make games for other consoles. Most of those games, early on, were ports of Dreamcast games. The two Sonic Adventure games were ported over to the Nintendo Gamecube, which was shocking at the time due to Sega and Nintendo's strong rivalry during the 90s. The Gamecube even got Phantasy Star Online, being one of the only Gamecube games to support online play.</p><p style="">Sony, the people whom many claimed to cause Sega to leave the hardware business, got <a href="/virtua-fighter-4/3030-4313/" data-ref-id="3030-4313">Virtua Fighter 4</a> for the PS2. Peter Moore, Sega of America's president at the time, left Sega to join Microsoft and help with their new console, the Xbox. Due to him being a part of Sega, he got Sega to make games on the Xbox. They got some exclusive games like <a href="/jsrf-jet-set-radio-future/3030-12117/" data-ref-id="3030-12117">Jet Set Radio Future</a>, <a href="/panzer-dragoon-orta/3030-4535/" data-ref-id="3030-4535">Panzer Dragoon Orta</a>, and <a href="/shenmue-ii/3030-1187/" data-ref-id="3030-1187">Shenmue II</a>.</p><p style="">Many popular Dreamcast games would be later ported to HD platforms such as the <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/" data-ref-id="3045-20">Xbox 360</a>, <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/" data-ref-id="3045-35">Playstation 3</a>, and the <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC</a>. In 2011, Sega released the Sega Dreamcast Collection for the Xbox 360 and PC, which brought over Sonic Adventure, Crazy Taxi, <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/sega-bass-fishing/3030-10998/" data-ref-id="3030-10998">Sega Bass Fishing</a>, and <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/space-channel-5-part-2/3030-113/" data-ref-id="3030-113">Space Channel 5: Part 2</a> with upgraded visuals and rendered at a high-definition resolution. Sega would later release other HD remakes of Dreamcast games such as <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/sonic-adventure-2/3030-19060/" data-ref-id="3030-19060">Sonic Adventure 2</a> and <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/jet-grind-radio/3030-20096/" data-ref-id="3030-20096">Jet Set Radio</a>.

The Amiga had similar specs as the Amiga 1200 and had the possibility to add mouse, keyboard, etc. It also had a covered expansion slot intended to accomodate a VideoCD playback module. This was eventually utilized by third parties to create other expansion modules that allowed the CD32 to act as a fully capable Amiga computer, first by adding missing ports and later providing for the ability to add a hard drive, memory and upgrade the CPU. The console lasted only for approximately seven months due to component supply issues and therefore it didn't have the sales impact to keep the console alive.</p><p style="">However, the console was kept alive in other forms: In the late 1990s to early 2000s, slot machine manufacturer StarGames utilized a stripped down CD32 motherboard in many of their slot machines and in the mid to late 1990s, some vehicle registries in Canada utilized CD32 systems for interactive multimedia testing for drivers license applications.</p><p style="">The CD32 also had a unique piece of hardware called the Akiko chip that was added specifically to enable the console to more easily support "Doom clones". It provided acceleration for converting the PC's chunky pixel format (which was better suited to the routines that generated the graphics in Doom-like games) to the Amiga's planar pixel format.</p><h2>Technical Specifications</h2><table data-max-width="true"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Processor</strong></td><td>Motorola 68EC020 @ 14.32 MHz (NTSC) or 14.18 MHz (PAL)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>RAM</strong></td><td>2 MB Amiga Chip RAM</td></tr><tr><td><strong>ROM</strong></td><td>1 MB Kickstart w/ CD32 firmware<br />1 KB EEPROM for game saves</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Graphics</strong></td><td><p style="">Advanced Graphics Architecture (AGA)</p><p style="">Akiko chip</p></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sound</strong></td><td>4 x 8-bit PCM channels</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Screen Resolution</strong></td><td>320x200 to 1280x400i (NSTC)<br />320x256 to 1280x512i (PAL)</td></tr><tr><td><strong> Operating System</strong></td><td>AmigaOS 3.1</td></tr></tbody></table>]]></description>

Atari's prior success with <a href="/pong/3025-1724/" data-ref-id="3025-1724">Pong</a>, both in arcades and in the home, lead to the development of the VCS. It was largely successful due home versions of arcade games such as <a href="/asteroids/3030-1034/" data-ref-id="3030-1034">Asteroids</a>, <a href="/space-invaders/3030-5099/" data-ref-id="3030-5099">Space Invaders</a>, and <a href="/centipede/3030-1157/" data-ref-id="3030-1157">Centipede</a> as well as first- and third-party games developed specifically for the console, such as <a href="/pitfall/3030-10014/" data-ref-id="3030-10014">Pitfall </a>and <a href="/adventure/3030-8851/" data-ref-id="3030-8851">Adventure</a>. The Atari 2600 made the home video game market mainstream, selling 30 million units worldwide before being discontinued in January 1, 1992.</p><h2>System</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The VCS is a second generation 8-bit game console. Video and sound output are handled through an RF modulator; the TV-Game switch. At least 6 different VCS/ Atari 2600 consoles were released, with different aesthetics and placement of the various switches.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Video is handled by the 1.19MHz 6607 CPU, with 128 bytes of RAM (thought cartridges could supplement this with 128-256 bytes). The NTSC and PAL versions have somewhat different specifications due to varying video standards - with the NTSC version supporting 128 colors, while the PAL version supports 108.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Input is handled through the included <a href="/atari-vcs-joystick/3055-785/" data-ref-id="3055-785">single button joystick</a>, or two for multi-player games, and a few games which use them in tandem. Additionally, Atari offered several other input devices.<a href="/atari-paddle-controllers/3000-88/" data-ref-id="3000-88"> Paddle controllers</a>, consisting of an analogue wheel and a side-mounted button were appropriate for games requiring precise motion on one axis, such as <a href="/kaboom/3030-9094/" data-ref-id="3030-9094">Kaboom!</a> and <a href="/breakout/3030-13049/" data-ref-id="3030-13049">Breakout</a>. <a href="/atari-keypad/3000-91/" data-ref-id="3000-91">Keypad controllers</a> feature 12 buttons, and can slide-lock into one another. Overlays exist for a few titles (most notably, <a href="/star-raiders/3030-730/" data-ref-id="3030-730">Star Raiders</a>) which sit atop the keypad controllers. Other, game specific controllers were also offered, such as the <a href="/atari-driving-controller/3000-89/" data-ref-id="3000-89">driving controller</a>; a paddle variant with 360 degree motion, and a <a href="/light-gun/3015-2354/" data-ref-id="3015-2354">light gun</a>.

Atari was getting hit the hardest by this crash- after all, this nightmare was caused partially by Atari itself. The main problem with the 2600 at this time was that its game lineup became overcrowded with bad games. This was mostly because Atari had placed no limitations on who could develop games and how many games could be put out in years or even financial quarters, which is now a mainstay in the video game business first implemented by companies like <a href="/sega/3010-62/" data-ref-id="3010-62">SEGA</a> and <a href="/nintendo/3010-90/" data-ref-id="3010-90">Nintendo</a>. This was around the time that <a href="/activision/3010-78/" data-ref-id="3010-78">Activision</a> broke off from Atari for more developmental freedom, becoming the first third-party publisher. During 1983, the market was saturated with hundreds of games, with most of them being of poor quality. Since anyone could make games for the Atari 2600, there were all kinds of companies making games who had no place doing so: i.e. cereal and dog food companies, which people would buy and get a refund for later or just ignore. With limited shelf space, retail outlets would eventually stop ordering new software while underselling older products just to make some shelf space. Games were heading into bargain bins, and the games market was going with them.</p><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-size="small" data-ref-id="1300-316516" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/316516-et2600box.jpg" data-ratio="1.3766666666667" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:137.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/316516-et2600box.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-316516"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/26/316516-et2600box.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/26/316516-et2600box.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>E.T for the Atari 2600 was a massive financial failure</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Two games are often the scapegoats of The Great Games Crash of 1983: the Atari 2600 version of <a href="/pac-man/3030-7624/" data-ref-id="3030-7624">Pac-Man</a> and <a href="/et-the-extra-terrestrial/3030-21595/" data-ref-id="3030-21595">E.T.</a>. Atari decided to get the exclusive rights to port <a href="/pac-man/3030-7624/" data-ref-id="3030-7624">Pac-Man</a> (the most popular arcade game during the time) to the Atari 2600. This idea looked excellent on paper, but in practice was a dismal failure. The final release of <a href="/pac-man/3030-7624/" data-ref-id="3030-7624">Pac-Man</a> for the Atari 2600 VCS barely resembled what the <a href="/arcade/3045-84/" data-ref-id="3045-84">arcade</a> version was. It was ugly, barely played, and had a sound that would likely haunt your mind to this day if you'd hear it. This version was actually a prototype-a proof of concept with no polish and little developmental time, yet was released anyways. In a rash assumption, Atari printed up more copies than there were Ataris owned, assuming the game would sell systems. The result could not have been more disastrous. Very few copies were sold and Atari was stuck in an awkward financial situation. <a href="/et-the-extra-terrestrial/3030-21595/" data-ref-id="3030-21595">E.T.</a> was its own disaster. The same sort of hubris occurred and Atari, so sure of itself, pressed too many copies once more. However, the game was of such poor quality that many sold copies of <a href="/et-the-extra-terrestrial/3030-21595/" data-ref-id="3030-21595">E.T.</a> were returned and refunded. This was such a disaster that it was more cost effective for Atari to simply bury all the copies in a landfill in New Mexico (this was once thought to be only a rumor, but has proven to be true). Atari never truly recovered from this shock.</p>]]></description>

The console was the successor to the <a href="/sega-genesis/3055-4659/" data-ref-id="3055-4659">Mega Drive</a> (known as the Genesis in <a href="/north-america/3035-1664/" data-ref-id="3035-1664">North America</a>).

At the time, the Saturn was a powerhouse with two CPU's and six more processors. The Saturn was a very complex machine as some of its parts were not designed to work together. The Saturn was originally designed to have a single main processor, with <a href="/2d/3015-1427/" data-ref-id="3015-1427">2D</a> and <a href="/25d/3015-660/" data-ref-id="3015-660">pseudo-3D</a> graphics similar to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_System_32" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">Sega System 32</a> <a href="/arcade/3045-84/" data-ref-id="3045-84">arcade </a>board and <a href="/polygonal-3d/3015-1430/" data-ref-id="3015-1430">3D graphics</a> similar to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Model_1" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">Sega Model 1</a> arcade system. However, after learning the 3D capabilities of the new <a href="/playstation/3045-22/" data-ref-id="3045-22">Playstation </a>(in turn <a href="http://www.wired.com/2012/09/how-virtua-fighter-saved-playstations-bacon/" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">influenced</a> by <a href="/sega/3010-62/" data-ref-id="3010-62">Sega</a>'s own <a href="/sega-am2/3010-81/" data-ref-id="3010-81">AM2</a>-developed <a href="/virtua-fighter/3030-15584/" data-ref-id="3030-15584">Virtua Fighter</a> in the <a href="/arcade/3045-84/" data-ref-id="3045-84">arcades</a>), the Sega Team added a new processor to increase 3D graphical performance.</p><p style="">When it came to <a href="/2d/3015-1427/" data-ref-id="3015-1427">2D</a> and <a href="/25d/3015-660/" data-ref-id="3015-660">pseudo-3D</a> graphical capabilities, the Saturn had the most powerful sprite and background manipulation capabilities of its generation. When it came to <a href="/polygonal-3d/3015-1430/" data-ref-id="3015-1430">3D polygons</a>, it had more power than the PlayStation but was more difficult to use.</p><p style="">Part of the reason for the system's failure was the complex graphics hardware, which was often difficult to work with. Many ports that came to the Saturn were downgraded and completely rewritten. It was also optimised for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">assembly language</a> rather than the more popular <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">C </a>language, which resulted in the use of C slowing down performance by several times compared to assembly. The Saturn was also mainly designed around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_mesh" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">quad polygons</a>, for greater compatibility with 2D graphics, rather than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_mesh" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">triangle polygons</a>, the more popular choice for 3D graphics. As a result of these design decisions, third-party support outside of Japan was very thin for the Sega Saturn.</p><h2>Success in Japan</h2><p style="">The Sega Saturn was rushed to the Japanese market in November of 1994. As a result of the difficulty to make games for the Sega Saturn, as well as the rushed release, very few games were available at the Saturn's launch. In <a href="/japan/3035-37/" data-ref-id="3035-37">Japan</a>, the Saturn sold around 170,000 units on launch day. Despite being outsold by the <a href="/playstation/3045-22/" data-ref-id="3045-22">PlayStation</a>, the Saturn's software had more sales than the Playstation's software did at the time. By the <a href="http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090118034238/vgsales/images/6/60/GameCase_-_Home_Video-game_industry_%281983-1996%29.pdf" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">end of 1996</a>, the Saturn's hardware sales in Japan were only 600,000 units behind the PlayStation, before the PlayStation pulled ahead in following years (especially after <a href="/final-fantasy-vii/3030-13053/" data-ref-id="3030-13053">Final Fantasy VII</a>).</p><p style="">Despite the PlayStation's lead, the Saturn went on to become Sega's most successful console in Japan, where it was the runner-up and outsold the <a href="/nintendo-64/3045-43/" data-ref-id="3045-43">Nintendo 64</a>. The Saturn's success in Japan was largely due to its large, diverse library of games, most of which were released exclusively in Japan and never made it to Western markets. These included action games such as various <a href="/virtua/3025-2870/" data-ref-id="3025-2870">Virtua</a> and <a href="/street-fighter/3025-331/" data-ref-id="3025-331">Street Fighter</a> titles, <a href="/visual-novel/3015-2029/" data-ref-id="3015-2029">visual novels</a> such as <a href="/yu-no-kono-yo-no-hate-de-koi-o-utau-shoujo/3030-1705/" data-ref-id="3030-1705">YU-NO</a> and <a href="/machi/3030-17132/" data-ref-id="3030-17132">Machi</a>, and RPG's such as <a href="/sakura-taisen/3025-385/" data-ref-id="3025-385">Sakura Wars</a>, <a href="/lunar/3025-489/" data-ref-id="3025-489">Lunar</a>, <a href="/grandia/3030-17659/" data-ref-id="3030-17659">Grandia</a>, etc.</p><p style="">The console's success in Japan was also partly due to Sega's marketing campaign, which largely revolved a new mascot character called <a href="/segata-sanshirou/3005-12921/" data-ref-id="3005-12921">Segata Sanshiro</a> (a parody of the classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_Kurosawa" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">Akira Kurosawa</a> film &amp; character, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanshiro_Sugata" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">Sugata Sanshiro</a>), who was never promoted outside of Japan.</p><h2>Lack of Overseas Success</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8153/1101492-zwei.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1101492" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.72" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:72.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8153/1101492-zwei.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1101492"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8153/1101492-zwei.jpg"></a><figcaption>Panzer Dragoon Zwei.</figcaption></figure><p style="">In <a href="/north-america/3035-1664/" data-ref-id="3035-1664">North America</a>, the set release date of the Saturn was originally September 2, 1995, one week before the release of the Playstation. This day was called "Saturnday," since September 2 fell on a Saturday that year. However, at E3 in 1995, Sega of America President <a href="/tom-kalinske/3040-101246/" data-ref-id="3040-101246">Tom Kalinske</a> was forced to announce an early release. The new release date was May 11, 1995, a good four months before the Playstation was to be released. This hurt the Saturn far more than it helped it. The Saturn ended up costing $100 USD more than the Playstation, and since most of the Saturn's third-party games were still scheduled to be released at the original launch date, the Saturn had very few launch titles. Many say this was a large factor in the Sega Saturn's eventual failure. The Saturn sold only 80,000 units by the time of the Playstation launch; in contrast, the Playstation sold 100,000 units upon its own launch. As a result of clashes with Sega of Japan about the management of Sega of America, the Saturn launch, and other issues, Tom Kalinske resigned in 1996. <a href="/bernard-stolar/3040-33719/" data-ref-id="3040-33719">Bernie Stolar</a>, Kalinske's replacement, would become a controversial figure after stating at E3 in 1997 that the Saturn was not Sega's future.</p><p style="">Meanwhile in <a href="/europe/3035-289/" data-ref-id="3035-289">Europe</a>, Sega systems had ruled the market since the 1980's. The <a href="/sega-master-system/3045-8/" data-ref-id="3045-8">Master System</a> and <a href="/genesis/3045-6/" data-ref-id="3045-6">Mega Drive</a> (known as Genesis in North America) were the top-selling consoles in Europe. However, when the Saturn was released in Europe in July 1995, the hype for the Playstation's upcoming release led to low Saturn sales there as well. This was the first time Sega had lost its lead in the European market, which it had previously dominated since the 8-bit era.</p><h2>Later years</h2><p style="">There were many different versions of the console. Sega allowed some companies who helped to make the Saturn to release their own versions of the console. Companies like Hitachi, JVC, and Samsung released their own Saturns with special features. In Japan, there were nine different models made by four different developers. In North America, there were only three models, all of which were made by Sega. In Europe and Australia, there were two models, both made by Sega.</p><p style="">By the end of the Saturn's overseas lifespan in 1998, about 470 games had been released. The final games released in 1997 and 1998, most notably Panzer Dragoon Saga, had low production numbers because of the system's impending demise. As a result, these games typically have high prices today, with Panzer Dragoon Saga regularly selling for $200 on eBay. By the end of the Saturn's Japanese lifespan in 2000, the console had nearly 600 games released, a majority of which were exclusive to Japan.</p><p style="">The system featured an option for memory expansion. There was a slot behind the CD tray where a storage card could be placed to save high scores, save files, and other data.</p><h2>Netlink and Online Play</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8153/1101493-segasaturn3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1101493" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.98765432098765" data-width="243" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 243px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:98.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8153/1101493-segasaturn3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1101493"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8153/1101493-segasaturn3.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8153/1101493-segasaturn3.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Saturn Net Link Device.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The Netlink modem was a cartridge that fit into the back cartridge slot of the Saturn (where the memory card fit into the system) and ran at a speed of 28.8 kbit/s connection in America and 14.4 kbit/s in Japan. It used a dial-up service, since broadband was unavailable at the time. There were web browsers available for navigating the Internet on the Saturn, but they were not used often. In Europe the Netlink modem was only released in Finland, where it was available with a localized web browser.</p><p style="">There were five games that supported the modem:</p><ul><li><a href="/virtual-on-cyber-troopers/3030-14749/" data-ref-id="3030-14749">Virtual On</a></li><li><a href="/daytona-usa-championship-circuit-edition/3030-4246/" data-ref-id="3030-4246">Daytona USA CCE: Netlink Edition</a></li><li><a href="/sega-rally-championship/3030-2162/" data-ref-id="3030-2162">Sega Rally: Netlink Edition</a></li><li><a href="/saturn-bomberman/3030-17854/" data-ref-id="3030-17854">Saturn Bomberman</a></li><li><a href="/duke-nukem-3d/3030-3407/" data-ref-id="3030-3407">Duke Nukem 3D</a></li></ul><p style="">These games are playable online even today because of the direct-dial support built into the modem. It uses the phone line in any home with the regular phone cable and, in a sense, "calls" the other Saturn console, regardless of its location within the same country. Since it uses the phone line, anyone who tries calling that number will be told that it is busy or in use. These games can only be played head-to-head. For its time, this was a large technological advance, especially considering the earlier XBAND service for both the <a href="/sega-genesis/3055-4659/" data-ref-id="3055-4659">Mega Drive / Genesis</a> and <a href="/snes/3055-2795/" data-ref-id="3055-2795">Super Famicom / SNES</a>.</p><h2>U.S Launch Titles</h2><p style="">The Saturn had an extremely limited launch lineup in America, because developers were uninformed of the surprise launch, and their games weren't ready yet. The following are U.S launch titles for the Sega Saturn released on May 11, 1995:</p><ul><li><a href="/virtua-fighter/3030-15584/" data-ref-id="3030-15584">Virtua Fighter</a></li><li><a href="/panzer-dragoon/3030-4489/" data-ref-id="3030-4489">Panzer Dragoon</a></li><li><a href="/daytona-usa/3030-225/" data-ref-id="3030-225">Daytona USA</a></li></ul><h2>Hardware Specifications</h2><p style="">Due to Sega's <a href="/arcade/3045-84/" data-ref-id="3045-84">arcade</a> heritage, Sega Saturn has multiple processors for specific operations.

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">By the end of the 90s a new generation of home consoles had arrived and current giant <a href="/nintendo/3010-90/" data-ref-id="3010-90">Nintendo</a> wasn't going to get left behind. After outstanding success with the <a href="/snes/3045-9/" data-ref-id="3045-9">SNES</a>, Nintendo decided it was time to move on to the next generation. They accomplished this by releasing the Nintendo 64 (or N64). The console debuted in <a href="/japan/3035-37/" data-ref-id="3035-37">Japan</a> on June 23, 1996, <a href="/north-america/3035-1664/" data-ref-id="3035-1664">North America</a> in September 29, 1996, and in <a href="/europe/3035-289/" data-ref-id="3035-289">Europe</a> and <a href="/australia/3035-292/" data-ref-id="3035-292">Australia</a> on March 1, 1997.</p><p style="">The console was a big leap from Nintendo's previous consoles as it had a 64-bit processor (hence the name). The <a href="/nes/3045-21/" data-ref-id="3045-21">NES</a> and <a href="/snes/3045-9/" data-ref-id="3045-9">SNES</a> had 8-bit and 16-bit processors respectively. The console shipped with Nintendo's flag ship titles: <i>Pilotwings 64</i> and <i>Super Mario 64</i>, for the first time in history gamers were able to see how <a href="/mario/3005-177/" data-ref-id="3005-177">Mario</a> looked in 3-D. Like previous consoles ( <a href="/nes/3045-21/" data-ref-id="3045-21">NES</a>, <a href="/snes/3045-9/" data-ref-id="3045-9">SNES</a>) the N64 used a cartridge system as opposed to that of its main competitors; the <a href="/sony-corporation/3010-3223/" data-ref-id="3010-3223">Sony</a> <a href="/playstation/3045-22/" data-ref-id="3045-22">PlayStation</a> and <a href="/sega/3010-62/" data-ref-id="3010-62">Sega</a> <a href="/saturn/3045-42/" data-ref-id="3045-42">Saturn</a>, which used CDs. This decision to use a cartridge system severely hampered the system's ability to compete with the <a href="/playstation/3045-22/" data-ref-id="3045-22">PlayStation</a>, resulting in a severe loss of market share, and the loss of partner <a href="/square-enix-ltd/3010-6492/" data-ref-id="3010-6492">Square-Enix</a> to Sony, which was a large blow to the Nintendo catalog.</p><p style="">The Nintendo 64 marked the first time a computer graphics manufacturer Silicon Graphics Inc. (SGI) developed game hardware technology.</p><p style="">Although it didn't sell as well as Nintendo's earlier machines, it marked a history in video games as it was the console that showed gamers how 2D play styles could be adapted into a 3D world with the analog stick, rumble, and built-in 4 player support.</p><p style="">The Nintendo 64 was succeeded by Nintendo's <a href="/gamecube/3045-23/" data-ref-id="3045-23">GameCube</a> in November 2001, but the console itself remained in production until its discontinuation in Japan on April 30th 2002, Austrailia on May 11th 2003, Europe on May 16th 2003 and in North America on November 30th 2003.</p><h3>Controller</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/968375-n64_controller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-968375" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.92533333333333" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:92.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/968375-n64_controller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-968375"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/968375-n64_controller.jpg"></a><figcaption>The Nintendo 64 Controller</figcaption></figure><p style="">The Nintendo 64 featured a unique controller that could be held multiple ways. The three-pronged controller had a center-mounted analog stick, something its competitors Sony and Sega had not implemented yet (though Sega introduced the Sega <a href="/saturn/3045-42/" data-ref-id="3045-42">Saturn's</a> 3-D Controller with an analog stick by the time the N64 hit the market). There was also a traditional directional pad on the left side, and and a set of six face buttons ("A", "B", and the four"C-Buttons") on the right.</p><p style="">The game's center handle also featured a trigger on the back, "The Z Button". This button was used instead of the "L" button in games which used the analog stick.</p><p style="">The underside of the controller featured an expansion slot where various accessories could be inserted to enhance gameplay. This trait was replicated on the controllers for Microsoft's <a href="/xbox/3045-32/" data-ref-id="3045-32">Xbox</a> and Sega's <a href="/dreamcast/3045-37/" data-ref-id="3045-37">Dreamcast.</a></p><h2>Launch Titles</h2><p style="">The N64 is famous for having the least amount of games for the launch of any Nintendo console, with three games in Japan and Europe at launch and only two games at launch in the USA. Each launch included the critically acclaimed <a href="/pilotwings-64/3030-108/" data-ref-id="3030-108">Pilotwings 64</a> and <a href="/super-mario-64/3030-2931/" data-ref-id="3030-2931">Super Mario 64</a> so most gamers were still happy to buy the console.</p><h3>Japan</h3><ul><li><a href="/pilotwings-64/3030-108/" data-ref-id="3030-108">Pilotwings 64</a></li><li>Saikyo Habu Shogi</li><li><a href="/super-mario-64/3030-2931/" data-ref-id="3030-2931">Super Mario 64</a></li></ul><h3>North America</h3><ul><li><a href="/pilotwings-64/3030-108/" data-ref-id="3030-108">Pilotwings 64</a></li><li><a href="/super-mario-64/3030-2931/" data-ref-id="3030-2931">Super Mario 64</a></li></ul><h3>Europe</h3><ul><li><a href="/pilotwings-64/3030-108/" data-ref-id="3030-108">Pilotwings 64</a></li><li><a href="/star-wars-shadows-of-the-empire/3030-12139/" data-ref-id="3030-12139">Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire</a></li><li><a href="/super-mario-64/3030-2931/" data-ref-id="3030-2931">Super Mario 64</a></li></ul><h2>Accessories</h2><h3>Paks</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/968378-n64_controller_pak_en.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-968378" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.8" data-width="155" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 155px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/968378-n64_controller_pak_en.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-968378"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/968378-n64_controller_pak_en.jpg"></a><figcaption>Nintendo 64 Controller Pak</figcaption></figure><p style="">During the lifespan of the N64, Nintendo released various "Paks" used to enhance the console in some way or give it extra functionality.</p><ul><li>The "Expansion Pak" expanded the system’s memory from 4 megabytes to 8. The Expansion Pak was required to play <a href="/perfect-dark/3030-21256/" data-ref-id="3030-21256">Perfect Dark</a>, <a href="/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/3030-13594/" data-ref-id="3030-13594">Zelda: Majora's Mask</a> and <a href="/donkey-kong-64/3030-15000/" data-ref-id="3030-15000">Donkey Kong 64</a>. It was optional in some games, like <a href="/turok-2-seeds-of-evil/3030-7052/" data-ref-id="3030-7052">Turok 2</a>, usually to enable higher resolutions.</li></ul><ul><li>The "Transfer Pak" allowed you to transfer data between the <a href="/game-boy/3045-3/" data-ref-id="3045-3">Game Boy</a> and the N64. The Pak plugged into the controller, and the Game Boy game cartridge was inserted into the top of the Pak. The games Pokemon Stadium and Pokemon Stadium 2 relied heavily on this pak, allowing you to transfer <a href="/pokemon/3025-452/" data-ref-id="3025-452">Pokemon</a> between games for use in battle.</li></ul><ul><li>The "Jumper Pak" served no real purpose other to eliminate the RAMBUS bus in absence of the expansion pak.</li></ul><ul><li>The "Controller Pak" was a memory card that plugged into the rear of the N64 controller. It was used for game save and option data. N64 games could include a battery save in the cartridge that eliminated the need for a controller pack, but this increased cartridge production costs. As a result, many third-party games did not support cartridge saves and required that players use a Controller Pak to save data.</li></ul><ul><li>The 'Rumble Pak' was a removable device which went into the back of the N64 controller and which provided force feedback while playing games. Games that supported the ‘Rumble Pak’ vibrated in select situations, such as when shooting weapons or taking damage. It was bundled with <a href="/star-fox-64/3030-19203/" data-ref-id="3030-19203">Star Fox 64</a> when it was first released in 1997. Some games that supported the ‘Rumble Pak’ include: <a href="/banjo-kazooie/3030-10920/" data-ref-id="3030-10920">Banjo-Kazooie</a>, <a href="/goldeneye-007/3030-3166/" data-ref-id="3030-3166"><i>GoldenEye</i></a> and <a href="/paper-mario/3030-19929/" data-ref-id="3030-19929"><i>Paper Mario</i></a>. Since the Rumble Pak, force feedback has become an industry standard, and the functionality is now built into current controllers.</li></ul><h3>64DD</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/968379-nintendo_64dd_docked.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-968379" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/968379-nintendo_64dd_docked.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-968379"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/968379-nintendo_64dd_docked.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/968379-nintendo_64dd_docked.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Nintendo 64DD</figcaption></figure><p style="">The <a href="/nintendo-64dd/3045-101/" data-ref-id="3045-101">Nintendo 64 Disk Drive</a> was an add-on to the N64 console designed to keep third party developers from making games for a CD based system. It allowed the reading of magnetic disks that were larger in capacity to cartridges and allowed for saving data in them.</p><p style="">Although it was heavily hyped even before the system was released, Over time however hype for the add-on signigicly tapered with consumers wondering why to play some hotly hyped games they would have to shell out money for it. Several games intially planned for the 64DD such as Mario RPG 2 (later renamed to <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/paper-mario/3030-19929/" data-ref-id="3030-19929">Paper Mario</a>) and Zelda Gaiden (Later renamed to<a href="//www.giantbomb.com/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/3030-13594/" data-ref-id="3030-13594"> Majora's Mask</a>) were instead released on N64 cartridges as opposed to 64DD disks primarily due to the add on being significantly delay.</p><p style="">The 64DD was eventually released in Japan in December of 1999, a North American release was planned for 200 however the idea was ultimately canned. Even in Japan it was only sold through Nintendo's subscription based service <a href="/randnet/3015-7464/" data-ref-id="3015-7464">RANDnet</a>, and not through ordinary stores.

Thanks to the analog stick on the controller, it brought a new way to play 3D videogames. Many of the games on the console (like <i>Super Mario 64</i>, <a href="/goldeneye-007/3030-3166/" data-ref-id="3030-3166"><i>Golden Eye</i></a>, and <a href="/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/3030-12572/" data-ref-id="3030-12572"><i>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</i></a>) innovated their genre and brought it over to the 3D world.</p><p style="">Thanks to <i>Super Mario 64</i>'s 3D gameplay, it started a new trend for free-roaming gameplay and has influenced many series to go in that direction ( <a href="/grand-theft-auto/3025-6/" data-ref-id="3025-6"><i>Grand Theft Auto</i></a>, for example). <i>Golden Eye</i> arguably presented the first compelling argument for <a href="/games/?sort=release_date&amp;filter_type=genre&amp;filter_value=32/">First Person Shooters</a> on consoles, and was widely lauded for its multiplayer. <a href="/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/3030-12572/" data-ref-id="3030-12572"><i>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</i></a> is considered by many as one of the best games of that generation (getting perfect 10 scores from many reviewers like IGN and Gamespot). Its 3D free-roaming gameplay revolutionized the adventure genre.</p><p style="">The system also introduced several new ideas to the gaming industry. The Nintendo 64 was the first console to introduce a rumble feature to their controller. The Rumble Pak was packaged with <i>Star Fox 64</i> in 1997. It was a huge leap into getting the player involved in the experience and the feature has been implemented in every controller since then (most notably the <a href="/dualshock-controller/3000-1/" data-ref-id="3000-1">DualShock</a> lineup for the <a href="/playstation/3045-22/" data-ref-id="3045-22">Playstation</a>).</p><p style="">It also helped a trend to transfer data from handhelds. Although the <a href="/super-game-boy-enhancement/3015-4804/" data-ref-id="3015-4804">Super Game Boy</a> was the first accessory to play <a href="/game-boy/3045-3/" data-ref-id="3045-3">Game Boy</a> games on the TV, the Transfer Pak was the first to use data from the games and use them in games. Many games like <a href="/pokemon-stadium/3030-7270/" data-ref-id="3030-7270">Pokemon Stadium</a> (in which the Transfer Pak was packaged in with) and <a href="/pokemon-stadium-2/3030-6132/" data-ref-id="3030-6132">Pokemon Stadium 2</a> used the Pokemon games for the <a href="/game-boy/3045-3/" data-ref-id="3045-3">Game Boy</a> to transfer your Pokemon over from the game and use them to fight on their console counterparts (you were also able to play the Pokemon games on your TV). This idea was used for many other systems to come like the <a href="/gamecube/3045-23/" data-ref-id="3045-23">Gamecube</a>, <a href="/wii/3045-36/" data-ref-id="3045-36">Wii</a>, <a href="/playstation-2/3045-19/" data-ref-id="3045-19">Playstation 2</a>, and <a href="/playstation-3/3045-35/" data-ref-id="3045-35">Playstation 3</a>.</p><h2>Best Selling Games</h2><p style="">The following are the top 10 best selling games for the Nintendo 64.

      <description><![CDATA[<p style="">ColecoVision is a video game console made by Coleco Industries. It was released in August of 1982. It was a home system with arcade type games. It also featured the strange ability to play Atari 2600 games, its competitor. About 120 titles were released for the ColecoVision during its lifespan.</p><p style="">The ColecoVision came with the game Nintendo's Donkey Kong as a pack-in game and is revered as a near-perfect arcade port. This increased the popularity of the ColecoVision and by the end of 1982 the ColecoVision had sold 500,000 units. Atari's marketing for a short time claimed the 5200 was more powerful, but ColecoVision did much better than the Atari 5200 in sales, and since the 5200 was based on the Atari 400/800 which was 3 years older, this claim didn't apear to hold much truth. Although the ColecoVision, at the time showed great sales and growth, the Atari 2600 still ruled the roost. The growth of the ColecoVision and the huge install base of the Atari 2600 helped start the first true Multi-platform movement in colsoles. Activision, Parker Brothers, and several other companies for a short time released some titles on near the same launch day for both consoles. The ColecoVision eventually sold more the one million units by 1983.</p><p style="">Outside of the United States, the ColecoVision is known as the CBS ColecoVision as it was distributed by CBS Electronics.</p><p style="">The ColecoVision was discontinued in 1984 due to the crash of the video game market in 1983.</p><p style="">The ColecoVision had three different expansion periphereals:</p><p style=""><b>-Expansion Module #1</b>: This allowed the ColecoVision to play Atari 2600 games which largely expanded the ColecoVision game library.</p><p style=""><b>-Expansion Module #2:</b> This was a driving controller that came with the pack-in game Turbo. It was only compatible with two other games from the ColecoVision library: Destructor and Dukes of Hazzard.</p><p style=""><b>-Expansion Module #3:</b> The ColecoVision's third expansion turned it into a computer called the Coleco Adam. It came with a full keyboard and digital dat pack cassette drives.</p><p style="">The primary games of the ColecoVision library were arcade games that Atari had not yet liscensed. The most popular of the ColecoVision games were Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Junior, Carnival, Lady Bug, Mouse Trap, and Zaxxon.<br /><br /></p><h2>Technical Specifications</h2><table data-max-width="true"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Processor</strong></td><td>NEC Zilog Z80A @ 3.58 MHz</td></tr><tr><td><strong>RAM</strong></td><td>1 KB (two 1K x 4-bit chips)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>ROM</strong></td><td>8 KB TMS4764 Mask ROM</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Graphics</strong></td><td><p style="">Texas Instruents TMS99928A Video Display Controller</p><ul><li>256x192 pixel resolution</li><li>32 sprints on-screen</li><li>16 colors</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sound</strong></td><td><p style="">Texas Intstuments SN76489A PSG chip</p><ul><li>3 tone generators</li><li>1 noise generator</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Storage</strong></td><td>ROM Cartridge (8, 16, 24 or 32 KB capacity)</td></tr></tbody></table>]]></description>

      <deck><![CDATA[A home computer created by Texas Instruments and released in 1981. It was the first home console to feature a 16-bit processor and included a prototype plug-and-play serial bus similar to what would become known as USB.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2>The TI99/4A shipped on June 12, 1981 with a price tag of $525 and was a successor to the less popular TI99/4 which was released two years earlier at double the price. The TI99/4A made several improvements over its predecessor including added graphics capabilities and lowercase letters, though it was still just the standard ACSII output but smaller. <br /> <br />The TI99/4A is best known for being the first home console to include a 16-bit processor, a full 10 years before the <a data-ref-id="3045-9" href="/snes/3045-9/">   SNES</a>. The system was however limited by the system RAM which created a bottleneck down to 256 bytes.  It also offered full Plug and Play capabilities that included not only system peripherals but printers and other home computing devices. Using a prototype high speed serial bus it could be seen as a prototype to today's USB plug-n-play hot-swappable systems. <br /><h2>Technical Specifications </h2><ul class="plain-list"><li>CPU: TI  TMS9900, 3.0  MHz,  16-bit</li><li>Memory: 16KB VDP RAM (expandable to 192 KB with the use of YAMAHA V9938)<br /></li><li>Video: TI  TMS9918A VDP <br /><ul class="plain-list"><li>32 single-color  sprites </li><li>16 fixed colors </li><li>Text mode: 40×24 characters <br /></li><li>Graphics mode: 32×24 characters <br /></li><li>Bitmap mode: 256×192 pixels</li><li>Multicolor mode: 64×48 pixels <br /></li></ul></li><li>Sound: TI TMS9919, later  SN94624<ul class="plain-list"><li>3 voices, 1 noise (white or periodic)</li><li>Voices generate square waves from 110 Hz to approximately 115 kHz</li><li>Console ROM includes interrupt-driven music list playback</li></ul></li></ul>]]></description>

      <deck><![CDATA[The Intellivision by Mattel Electronics was a system known for its unique controllers and cutting-edge graphics in the early 1980s, but it was ultimately overshadowed by the technically less powerful, Atari 2600.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2 style="margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;">Overview</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The Intellivision was created by <a href="/mattel-electronics/3010-460/" data-ref-id="3010-460">Mattel Electronics </a>and released nationwide in 1980, with <a href="/las-vegas-poker-blackjack/3030-1411/" data-ref-id="3030-1411"><i>Las Vegas </i>Poker &amp; Blackjack </a>as the pack-in game. In late 1982, the pack-in was changed to<a href="/astrosmash/3030-8125/" data-ref-id="3030-8125"> Astrosmash</a>. Most of the marketing campaign focused on comparing the Intellivision to the <a href="/atari-2600/3045-40/" data-ref-id="3045-40">Atari 2600</a>, demonstrating the Intellivision's graphical and technological superiority.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The console had its cartridge slot on the right side of the system, and the top was utilized for controller storage. The controllers were permanently attached with spiral cords, and featured a numeric keypad, a circular paddle that detected 16 directions, and four rubber buttons on the sides of the controller. Most games came with small plastic overlays that could be inserted into the controller over the keypad, to help players learn and remember game controls. One disadvantage to the controller was its inability to use the disc and keypad inputs at the same time, making "run &amp; gun" tactics difficult for games that used the disc for movement and the keypad for firing. The most popular solution to this problem involved using one controller's disc to move and the other controller's keypad to shoot. The controller's side buttons posed another problem, as they were very stiff and unresponsive, making games that utilized them difficult, and extended gameplay painful on thumbs.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Although the Intellivision was more powerful, it was never as popular as the Atari 2600, which had more popular games because developers were more interested in exploring the possibilities of the 2600's capabilities. Due to excessive competition in the console market that brought about the "video game crash" of 1983, game sales for the Intellivision tanked, and in 1984 Mattel Electronics was shut down by its parent company Mattel. The rights to the Intellivision name brand and its games were eventually bought by <a href="/intv/3010-2047/" data-ref-id="3010-2047">INTV Corporation</a>, who made new consoles and introduced new games slowly over time. Production on Intellivision consoles ceased permanently in 1991.</p><h2>Intellivoice</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The Intellivoice was a peripheral developed by Mattel Electronics in conjunction with General Instruments. It used G.I.'s SP0256 Narrator speech synthesis chip. Released in 1982, the peripheral sold very poorly and as such only 5 games were ever supported. The original retail price of the unit was $100.</p><h2>Technical Specs</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">General Instrument CP1610 16-bit microprocessor CPU running at 894.886 kHz (i.e., slightly less than 1 MHz)</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">1456 bytes of RAM:</p><ul><li>240 × 8-bit Scratchpad Memory</li><li>352 × 16-bit (704 bytes) System Memory</li><li>512 × 8-bit Graphics RAM</li></ul><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">7168 bytes of ROM:</p><ul><li>4096 × 10-bit (5120 bytes) Executive ROM</li><li>2048 × 8-bit Graphics ROM</li></ul><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">160 pixels wide by 196 pixels high (5×2 TV pixels make one Intellivision pixel)</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">16 color palette, all of which can be on the screen at once</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">8 sprites.

It was the first Nintendo platform to utilize a touch screen display, and the first since the <a href="/game-watch/3025-1183/" data-ref-id="3025-1183">Game and Watch</a> to utilize two screens.</p><p style="">The Nintendo DS features two 3-inch screens positioned vertically in the center of the unit. Every iteration of the console has featured a clamshell design with one screen on either side of the hinge. The bottom screen is a resistive touchscreen, and the system ships with a stylus for use on this screen. The touch screen can register only one point of input at a time.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/813144-nintendo_wi_fi_connection_logo.gif" data-ref-id="1300-813144" data-size="small" style="width: 200px" data-ratio="1.005" data-width="200" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/813144-nintendo_wi_fi_connection_logo.gif" data-ref-id="1300-813144"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/813144-nintendo_wi_fi_connection_logo.gif"></a><figcaption>Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection logo</figcaption></figure><p style="">Every version of the DS features a built-in microphone, and games may require players to yell, blow, or talk into the microphone as a type of input. In addition, Wi-Fi capabilities are built into the system through an IEEE 802.11b device. Most online-capable games for the DS are integrated into Nintendo's own <a href="/nintendo-wi-fi-connection/3015-2131/" data-ref-id="3015-2131">Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection</a>. This service, introduced in 2005 with <a href="/mario-kart-ds/3030-6539/" data-ref-id="3030-6539">Mario Kart DS</a>, is completely free, and focused on providing the user with a simple interface for online gameplay. As of today, there are over 90 games released that are online compatible, and that number is expected to grow to a total of 130 games in the near future.</p><p style="">There have been approximately 144.6 DS units sold worldwide as of December 31 2010 (all versions combined).

The DSi is 12% thinner than the DS Lite, due to the removal of the GBA slot at the bottom of the system. The screens on the system are slightly larger than those on previous versions at 3.25 inches. The DSi comes with an external 0.3 MP (megapixel) camera and a front-facing camera built into the hinge of the system. The DSi also comes with an SD and SDHC card slot on the side and has 256 MB flash memory built in.</p><p style="">Nintendo also launched the DSi Store, which carries <a href="/dsiware/3045-106/" data-ref-id="3045-106">DSiWare</a> games and software. The store uses the renamed Nintendo Points, 1000 of which came free with the DSi until March 2010, and content is priced at 0, 200, 500, or 800 points. Nintendo Points cards can only be used for one platform at a time, and Points from a single card cannot be shared between the two platforms.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7439/719895-nintendo_points.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-719895" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.75187969924812" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7439/719895-nintendo_points.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-719895"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7439/719895-nintendo_points.jpeg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7439/719895-nintendo_points.jpeg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Nintendo Points Card</figcaption></figure><p style="">The DSi launched in Japan on November 1st, 2008 for ¥18,900 ($178). It was released in Europe on April 3rd, and in the Americas on April 5th for $169.99.</p><h3>New Interface</h3><p style="">Nintendo has also updated the DS interface menu to accommodate new software. Users were Initially able to access the following programs from the main menu: DSi Camera, DSi Sound, DSi Shop, PictoChat, and download play, although this has been improved upon. The menu also includes icons for starting a game from a DS cartridge and accessing system settings.</p><p style="">The Nintendo DSi comes with a free <a href="/nintendo-dsi-browser/3030-24931/" data-ref-id="3030-24931">Web Browser</a> made by Opera which uses built-in RAM, a more efficient alternative to the DS add-on web browser, which came with RAM that went into the GBA port.</p><p style="">The DSi's menu is based on the Wii Channel interface. Users will be able to add new programs that will be listed on the screen.</p><h3>DSi Cards &amp; DSi Enhanced Cards</h3><p style="">At GDC 2009, DSi project leader Matsato Kuwahara revealed that the company will be releasing two different kinds of DS cartridges. "<a href="/nintendo-dsi-exclusive-cartridge-games/3015-3774/" data-ref-id="3015-3774">DSi Cards</a>" will only work with the DSi itself, while "DSi Enhanced Cards" will work with all DS systems, with extra features when used with the DSi. This strategy will allow developers to take advantage of DSi-specific features.

It helped the PC Engine outsell the <a href="/nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-21/" data-ref-id="3045-21">NES</a> for a while (up until the release of the <a href="/super-nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-9/" data-ref-id="3045-9">SNES</a>) and become the second best-selling console of the 16-bit era, behind the <a href="/super-nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-9/" data-ref-id="3045-9">Super Famicom</a> (which later planned its own <a href="/playstation/3045-22/" data-ref-id="3045-22">PlayStation</a> CD add-on) and ahead of the <a href="/genesis/3045-6/" data-ref-id="3045-6">Sega Mega Drive</a> (which later had its own CD-ROM add-on, the <a href="/sega-cd/3045-29/" data-ref-id="3045-29">Sega CD</a>).</p><h2>Overview</h2><p style="">This device was the first system to introduce the CD-ROM format (which was officially released by <a href="/sony-corporation/3010-3223/" data-ref-id="3010-3223">Sony</a> and Philips just months before its release), predating the <a href="/fm-towns/3045-108/" data-ref-id="3045-108">FM Towns</a> computer by a couple of months and the <a href="/sega-cd/3045-29/" data-ref-id="3045-29">Sega CD</a> console add-on by several years. The platform would see a full redesign in 1991 (October 1992 in North America) as the PC Engine Duo, or TurboDuo. The Duo console merged the card-playing base console an CD-ROM add-on into one piece of hardware.</p><p style="">Initially, playing CD-ROM games on a TG16 required the use of a System Card, which carried the BIOS data required to properly access the TGCD hardware. When the Duo was released, an updated version of this firmware was included in the console itself, booting whenever the system was powered-up without a card inserted into the card slot. The firmware released with the Duo was upgraded to allow the platform to play "Super CD" releases. Owners of the existing, non-Duo version of the platform were forced to purchase a new system card (the "Super System Card") to play these new discs. In Japan, one further upgrade, known as the Arcade Card, was released. Only a handful of games (known as "Arcade CDs") were released that require the Arcade Card upgrade. The Arcade Card was not released outside of Japan.</p><p style="">Discs released for the TGCD hardware are region-free and can be booted on any version of the PC Engine hardware, assuming that the appropriate system card is present. Both the Duo models and the TGCD add-on have built-in memory, allowing players to save progress and scores in supported titles. By pressing Select at the system's boot screen, a data management screen can be accessed.</p><p style="">An <a href="/online/3015-559/" data-ref-id="3015-559">online</a> modem was also planned for the console in Japan, in order to compete with the online services of the <a href="/nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-21/" data-ref-id="3045-21">Nintendo Famicom</a> and <a href="/genesis/3045-6/" data-ref-id="3045-6">Sega Mega Drive</a> (and later the <a href="/super-nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-9/" data-ref-id="3045-9">Super Famicom</a>), but it was eventually cancelled.</p><h2><b>Games</b></h2><p style="">As the first system to use the CD-ROM format, it introduced several new features to home video games, including a very large amount of storage space (540 MB of data, in contrast to the 1 or 2 MB cartridges of that era), <a href="/cinematic-games/3015-4700/" data-ref-id="3015-4700">cinematic</a> <a href="/cutscene/3015-22/" data-ref-id="3015-22">cutscenes</a> and <a href="/voice-acting/3015-1413/" data-ref-id="3015-1413">voice acting</a> (both previously limited to laserdisc <a href="/arcade/3005-4757/" data-ref-id="3005-4757">arcade</a> games, i.e. <a href="/cinematic-games/3015-4700/" data-ref-id="3015-4700">interactive movies</a>), and CD-quality <a href="/redbook-audio/3015-6487/" data-ref-id="3015-6487">Red Book audio</a> (a huge improvement over the <a href="/chiptune/3015-3745/" data-ref-id="3015-3745">chiptune</a> audio of previous home systems). Some of the first home video games to demonstrate these features include <a href="/no-ri-ko/3030-39939/" data-ref-id="3030-39939">No-Ri-Ko</a> (1988), <a href="/tengai-makyou-ziria-haruka-naru-jipang/3030-23450/" data-ref-id="3030-23450">Far East of Eden: Ziria</a> (1989), and <a href="/ys-book-i-ii/3030-13964/" data-ref-id="3030-13964">Ys I &amp; II</a> (1989).</p><p style=""><a href="/full-motion-video/3015-604/" data-ref-id="3015-604">Full-motion</a> animation was not used as frequently in early games for the TGCD, this being before the "multimedia gaming" era that the <a href="/sega-cd/3045-29/" data-ref-id="3045-29">Sega CD</a> and the <a href="/3do/3045-26/" data-ref-id="3045-26">3DO</a> fell into. The cinematics in the games were usually more <a href="/games-based-on-anime/3015-765/" data-ref-id="3015-765">anime</a>-like in nature (and rendered <a href="/in-engine-cinematic/3015-964/" data-ref-id="3015-964">in-engine</a>), which served to partially hide the limitations of the unit's single-speed CD drive, with some of the most beautiful cutscenes being present in games like <a href="/ys-book-i-ii/3030-13964/" data-ref-id="3030-13964">Ys Book I &amp; II</a>, <a href="/ys-iii-wanderers-from-ys/3030-4208/" data-ref-id="3030-4208">Ys III</a> and <a href="/ys-iv-the-dawn-of-ys/3030-18453/" data-ref-id="3030-18453">IV</a>, <a href="/tengai-makyou/3025-1326/" data-ref-id="3025-1326">Far East of Eden</a>, <a href="/cosmic-fantasy-2/3030-1566/" data-ref-id="3030-1566">Cosmic Fantasy 2</a>, and a remake of <a href="/valis-the-fantasm-soldier/3030-6510/" data-ref-id="3030-6510">Valis: The Fantasm Soldier</a>. The system was more widely supported in its native country of Japan, which received a much larger library of games for the device than North America did.</p><p style="">Today, the system is primarily known in North America as a home for quality shoot-'em-ups, like <a href="/lords-of-thunder/3030-16979/" data-ref-id="3030-16979">Lords of Thunder</a>, <a href="/gate-of-thunder/3030-20937/" data-ref-id="3030-20937">Gate of Thunder</a>, <a href="/r-type/3025-419/" data-ref-id="3025-419">R-Type Complete CD</a>, and more, as well as for RPG's with cinematic cutscenes and CD-quality audio soundtracks (such as the early <a href="/ys/3025-112/" data-ref-id="3025-112">Ys</a> games, for example).</p><p style=""> </p>]]></description>

It was created by <a data-ref-id="3010-272" href="/bandai-co-ltd/3010-272/" slug="bandai-co-ltd">      Bandai</a>, and the successor to the original <a data-ref-id="3045-65" href="/wonderswan/3045-65/" slug="wonderswan">    WonderSwan</a>. In Japan, it was met with modest success and sales (especially considering <a data-ref-id="3010-90" href="/nintendo/3010-90/" slug="nintendo">      Nintendo</a>'s near-monopoly of the handheld market). The market share of the WonderSwan Color was approximately 8%, according to Bandai. Much of this success is credited to the low price of the handheld; ¥6800, or $59. The WonderSwan Color also had great third party support, with companies such as <a data-ref-id="3010-6323" href="/square-co-ltd/3010-6323/" slug="square-co-ltd">      Squaresoft</a> (who ported many of the original Final Fantasy games to the WonderSwan Color). When the WonderSwan Color's successor, the <a data-ref-id="3045-97" href="/swancrystal/3045-97/" slug="swancrystal">   SwanCrystal</a>, was released, Nintendo had regained support of Squaresoft, however. One of the unique features of the WonderSwan (all versions) was the fact that it could be played either horizontally or vertically. <br/><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/958521-wswanc.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-958521" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.74333333333333" data-width="300" style="width: 300px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:74.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/958521-wswanc.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-958521"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/958521-wswanc.jpg"></a><figcaption>The WonderSwan Color bundled with Final Fantasy.</figcaption></figure>The original WonderSwan featured only black and white. Naturally, the WonderSwan Color had a color LCD screen (as well as several more upgrades). The WonderSwan Color is slightly larger (7 mm larger) and heavier (2 g heavier), contained more RAM (64k of RAM). The WonderSwan Color is backwards compatible with many of the original WonderSwan's game (as well as the WonderSwan being compatible with many of the WonderSwan Color's games).<br/><br/>Similar to the <a data-ref-id="3045-52" href="/nintendo-ds/3045-52/" slug="nintendo-ds">  Nintendo DS</a>, before the WonderSwan Color can be used, the player must enter data about oneself, including birth date (year, month, and day), name, sex, and blood type. The name appears under Bandai's logo whenever the handheld console is turned on. The WonderSwan Color launched in several colors (five, in fact): Pearl Blue, Crystal Pink, Crystal Black, and Crystal Orange. In addition, several limited editions of the console were released. Also, the console had a Final Fantasy bundle, packaged with either the original <a data-ref-id="3030-8403" href="/final-fantasy/3030-8403/" slug="final-fantasy">      Final Fantasy</a> or <a data-ref-id="3030-2094" href="/final-fantasy-ii/3030-2094/" slug="final-fantasy-ii">      Final Fantasy II</a>, and a Final Fantasy skinned WonderSwan Color.<br/><br/><h2>Technical Specifications</h2><ul class="plain-list"><li>CPU: SPGY-1002, 3.072 MHz 16-bit NEC V30MZ duplicate</li><li>Memory: 64 kB shared VRAM/WRAM</li><li>Screen: FSTN reflective LCD, 2.8 in (71 mm), 224x144 pixels, 241 colors</li><li>Sound: One mono speaker, optional headphones (mute, soft, loud settings)</li><li>Link: Link adapter required for two players</li><li>Power: 20 hours of gameplay on one AA battery</li><li>Size: 128 mm x 743 mm x 24.3 mm</li><li>Weight: 95 g (3.35 oz)</li></ul>]]></description>

It is known in <a href="/japan/3035-37/" data-ref-id="3035-37">Japan</a> as the PC Engine and was released in Japan on October 30, 1987. It was released in <a href="/north-america/3035-1664/" data-ref-id="3035-1664">North America</a> on August 29, 1989, and was released in a very limited manner in <a href="/europe/3035-289/" data-ref-id="3035-289">Europe</a> in 1990. The console is known as the PC Engine Plus in the <a href="/united-kingdom/3035-492/" data-ref-id="3035-492">UK</a> (where many gamers preferred importing the Japanese PC Engine instead) and as simply the TurboGrafx elsewhere in Europe.</p><p style="">Games were distributed on HuCards, which are roughly the size of a credit card and about twice as thick; similar to the Sega Card used by the <a href="/sega-master-system/3045-8/" data-ref-id="3045-8">Master System</a>. The original TurboGrafx-16 console included one <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/turbopad/3000-52/" data-ref-id="3000-52">TurboPad</a> controller, and the <a href="/pack-in-game/3015-1247/" data-ref-id="3015-1247">pack-in</a> title: <a href="/keith-courage-in-alpha-zones/3030-3479/" data-ref-id="3030-3479">Keith Courage in Alpha Zones</a>. The TurboGrafx-16 was the first (and only) major console release by any company to include a multifire (turbo)-capable controller. The <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/turbostick/3000-51/" data-ref-id="3000-51">TurboStick</a>, an arcade-style controller; and the <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/turbotap/3000-50/" data-ref-id="3000-50">TurboTap</a>, a 5-player multitap, were also offered.</p><p style="">A large expansion port at the rear of the console is hidden under a removable plastic cover. The optional <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/turbobooster/3000-53/" data-ref-id="3000-53">TurboBooster</a> accessory attaches to the expansion port, and boosts the system's video RAM, while provisioning the system for composite video output, and stereo sound. This was a fairly novel feature at release.</p><h2>16-bit marketing</h2><p style="">The TurboGrafx-16 was the first console to be marketed as a 16-bit console, though it is debatable whether it qualifies as a 16-bit console. While the central CPU of the TG-16 is 8-bit, the dual GPU processor setup and graphics card is 16-bit, and can display 482 colors at once out of a 512 color palette. It was the <a href="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/399405/features/history-lesson-turbografx-pc-engine/" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">first console</a> that came reasonably close to <a href="/arcade/3045-84/" data-ref-id="3045-84">arcade</a>-quality graphics, approaching that of a mid-range arcade machine at the time. Its 8-bit CPU was also faster than the 16-bit CPU of the <a href="/super-nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-9/" data-ref-id="3045-9">SNES</a>, though not the <a href="/genesis/3045-6/" data-ref-id="3045-6">Mega Drive</a>.</p><p style="">While often not considered a "true" 16-bit console due to its use of an 8-bit CPU, the PC Engine technically surpassed both of its true 16-bit rivals, the <a href="/genesis/3045-6/" data-ref-id="3045-6">Mega Drive</a> (released 1988) and <a href="/super-nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-9/" data-ref-id="3045-9">SNES</a> (released 1990), by the end of the 16-bit era, due to expansions such as the <a href="/turbografx-cd/3045-53/" data-ref-id="3045-53">Super CD-ROM</a> and Arcade Card in Japan providing greater storage capacity and RAM memory.</p><h2>Popularity in Japan</h2><p style="">The PC Engine was very popular in Japan, where NEC had already been dominating the personal computer market with the <a href="/nec-pc-8801/3045-109/" data-ref-id="3045-109">PC-88</a> and <a href="/nec-pc-9801/3045-112/" data-ref-id="3045-112">PC-98</a> platforms. By 1988, it had outsold <a href="/nintendo/3010-90/" data-ref-id="3010-90">Nintendo's</a> <a href="/nes/3045-21/" data-ref-id="3045-21">Famicom</a>, becoming Japan's console leader until the <a href="/super-nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-9/" data-ref-id="3045-9">Super Famicom</a>'s release in 1990. Meanwhile, the PC Engine continued to outsell the Sega Mega Drive in Japan throughout the 16-bit era.</p><p style="">The console's success in Japan was partly due to NEC's strong presence in the personal computer market, with the PC-88 and PC-98 systems dominating the country's computer market for nearly two decades.</p><p style="">The PC Engine was also smaller than its later TurboGrafx counterpart released in North America. The PC Engine was about the same size of a <a href="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/399405/features/history-lesson-turbografx-pc-engine/" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">packet of crisps</a>, making it the smallest console ever released up until then.</p><h3>PC Engine CD-ROM</h3><p style="">The console's success was mainly due to the <a href="/turbografx-cd/3045-53/" data-ref-id="3045-53">PC Engine CD-ROM</a> peripheral, which allowed greater storage space, more RAM, and higher audio quality, than rival consoles. It had a very large library of CD-ROM games released exclusively in Japan.</p><h2>Introduction in North America</h2><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/25/176113-turbografx.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-176113" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.98333333333333" data-width="0" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:98.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/25/176113-turbografx.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-176113"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/25/176113-turbografx.jpg"></a><figcaption>TurboGrafx CD</figcaption></figure><p style="">The TG-16 was released in North America with a CD-ROM peripheral that cost about $400 USD. It was called the <a href="/turbografx-cd/3045-53/" data-ref-id="3045-53">TurboGrafx-CD</a>. This was the first home gaming peripheral in the US to use CD's. The debut titles of the TG-CD were popular, but the TG-CD library grew slowly compared to the TG-16 HuCards.</p><p style="">Despite slow CD growth, the PC Engine CD-ROM peripheral had a very large library of CD-ROM games that were released almost exclusively in Japan, including gems such as <a href="/akumajo-dracula-x-chi-no-rondo/3030-12673/" data-ref-id="3030-12673">Dracula X: Rondo of Blood</a>. However, because most of these titles were never localized for the US, the US library size for the TG-CD was eclipsed by the later released <a href="/sega-cd/3045-29/" data-ref-id="3045-29">Sega CD</a>, despite the Sega CD's library being significantly smaller than the PC Engine CD-ROM's library in Japan.</p><h2>In Europe</h2><p style="">After the US release of the TurboGrafx-16, NEC got cold feet upon seeing the sales numbers and decided to cancel their planned European releases. All of the stock planned for release in Europe - US systems poorly modified to run on PAL televisions - was instead sold to various distributors to handle themselves.</p><h3>The United Kingdom</h3><p style="">The UK's allotment of consoles was bought up and handled by <a href="/telegames-inc/3010-6/" data-ref-id="3010-6">Telegames</a>, who elected to sell the console via mail-order as the Turbografx. Telegames reportedly found supporting the system difficult, as PAL consoles would no longer be manufactured, resulting in limited supplies.</p><h3>In France</h3><p style="">In France, the system was imported and sold without license by Sodipeng (Société de Distribution de la PC Engine), a subsidiary of Guillemot International, a hardware distribution firm founded by the same people as <a href="/ubisoft-entertainment/3010-82/" data-ref-id="3010-82">Ubisoft</a>.</p><h2>Other expansions</h2><p style="">Most early games relied on the console's 2 KB internal memory to <a href="/save-point/3015-51/" data-ref-id="3015-51">save</a> data; this was the first time game saves could be stored internally within a console. The <a href="/turbografx-cd/3045-53/" data-ref-id="3045-53">TurboDuo </a>later increased the internal memory for save data to 192 KB. An additional device to store save data was also released, the Memory Base 128. This was the first device to allow game saves to be stored externally from the console or games themselves.</p><p style="">A modem expansion was also intended for the Japanese market, to compete with the online services of the Famicom and Mega Drive (and later the Super Famicom). The project was eventually cancelled, however.</p><h3>PC Engine Multitap / TurboTap</h3><p style="">The TurboGrafx-16 was also the first console to feature a multitap adaptor, which allowed up to five players to play at the same time, in titles such as the <a href="/4-player-co-op/3015-2563/" data-ref-id="3015-2563">5-player co-op</a> action RPG tile <a href="/dungeon-explorer/3030-7849/" data-ref-id="3030-7849">Dungeon Explorer</a>. The PC Engine Multitap, released in 1987, was the <a href="http://www.racketboy.com/retro/turbografx-16/tubrografix-16-tg16-101-beginners-guide" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">first multitap</a> peripheral for a console, <a href="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/399405/features/history-lesson-turbografx-pc-engine/" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">setting a template</a> for later multitap peripherals such as the <a href="/super-multitap/3000-48/" data-ref-id="3000-48">Super Multitap</a> and <a href="/multitap-for-playstation-2/3000-18/" data-ref-id="3000-18">PlayStation Multitap</a>.</p><h3>PC Engine GT / TurboExpress / PC Engine LT</h3><p style="">The TurboExpress / PC Engine GT handheld system was released in 1990 for $249.99. It plays all HuCards on a backlit color LCD screen, with a typical 3-hour battery life on a set of 6 AA batteries. The size of the screen was an issue on text-heavy games, as games were designed to have legible text on larger TV sets. The $249-$299 retail price proved to be too high for all except the most well-heeled gamers, and accessories like the TurboVision (a TV tuner) weren't enough to help the TurboExpress ever gain wide acceptance. Though unpopular, TurboExpress was ahead of its time for a handheld, as the most powerful console of its era, playing the same games as the full console. The <a href="/genesis/3045-6/" data-ref-id="3045-6">Sega Nomad</a> accomplished a similar goal (playing Mega Drive / Genesis carts on a portable) five years later.</p><p style="">In 1991, the <a href="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/399405/features/history-lesson-turbografx-pc-engine/" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">PC Engine LT</a> was released in Japan, with a new case design that resembles the later <a href="/game-boy-advance/3045-4/" data-ref-id="3045-4">Game Boy Advance SP</a> and <a href="/nintendo-ds/3045-52/" data-ref-id="3045-52">Nintendo DS</a>.</p><h3>Arcade Card / Arcade CD-ROM</h3><p style="">NEC released the Arcade Card expansion in 1994. It greatly increased the system's RAM, giving it up to 2304 KB of memory. The Arcade Card expansion, however, was never released in the U.S.</p><p style="">Despite having an 8-bit CPU, the Arcade Card's increased memory allows its graphical quality to greatly exceed its 16-bit rivals, the Super Famicom and Sega Mega Drive, though not quite as advanced as the more expensive <a href="/neo-geo/3045-25/" data-ref-id="3045-25">Neo Geo</a>. The increased memory also allows full-motion video at a much higher quality than the Sega CD.</p><h2>Console's downfall in North America</h2><p style="">The TG-16 was marketed as a 16-bit console, but struggled against its competition since it was an 8-bit/16-bit hybrid. It also struggled in North America because many big developers supported the PC Engine, but also made games primarily for Nintendo. Nintendo's licensing policies of the day made developers sign exclusivity agreements with them to ensure games on the NES would not be ported to other consoles. Nintendo said at the time this was to ensure there would not be another crash of the video game market like 1984. This made it all but impossible for the TG-16 to import well-known franchises for its limited American audience.</p><p style="">In October of 1992, NEC partnered with Hudson Soft to release the TurboDuo. Essentially, a TG-16 combined with the Turbo CD system. It also had system BIOS upgrades and an additional 192k of RAM built in. It was initially sold for $299. At the same time a Super System card was released for $60. It contained the new BIOS and additional RAM for owners of the original TG-16 and CD-ROM to play the updated games. The Duo (as it was shortened to) and the Super System Card also failed to gain much ground and was another disappointment in the US market. According to <a href="http://gamepro.com" rel="nofollow"><i>Gamepro.com</i></a>, the TurboGrafx-16 is the #9 worst-selling game console of all time, at least in North America.</p><h2>Hardware Specifications</h2><h3>CPU (Central Processing Unit)</h3><ul><li>CPU processor: 8-bit Hudson HuC6280A (based on MOS 6502) at 7.6 MHz <ul><li>Performance: 3.3 MIPS (Million Instructions Per Second)</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Graphics</h3><ul><li>GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) processors: Dual 16-bit Hudson GPU setup <ul><li>Video Display Controller (VDC) chip: HuC6270A (2x with <a href="/supergrafx/3045-119/" data-ref-id="3045-119">SuperGrafx</a>)</li><li>Video Color Encoder (VCE) chip: HuC6260</li></ul></li><li>Color palette: 9-bit (512 colors)</li><li>Maximum colors on screen: 482</li><li>Maximum sprites on screen: 64 (128 with SuperGrafx)</li><li>Screen resolution: 256x224 - 512x242 (most commonly 256x239)</li><li>Possible AV outputs: RF, Composite</li></ul><h3>Sound</h3><ul><li>Sound CPU: HuC6280A also used to program/control sound</li><li>6 channel wavetable at 3.58 MHz, PSG (programmable sound generator)</li><li>5-10 bit stereo PCM</li><li>LFO (low frequency oscillation), noise generation, DAC (digital-analog converter)</li><li>TurboGrafx-CD expansion <ul><li>Sound chip: Oki MSM5205 ADPCM chip</li><li>Sound DRAM memory: 128 KB (64 KB for samples, 64 KB for code and data)</li><li>Audio formats: ADPCM, CD-DA, <a href="/redbook-audio/3015-6487/" data-ref-id="3015-6487">Red Book</a></li></ul></li></ul><h3>Memory</h3><ul><li>RAM memory <ul><li>Main RAM memory: 8 KB</li><li>Video RAM (VRAM) memory: 64 KB (128 KB with SuperGrafx)</li><li>Additional RAM expansions: 64 KB (<a href="/turbografx-cd/3045-53/" data-ref-id="3045-53">TurboGrafx-CD</a>), 256 KB (TurboDuo), 2304 KB (Arcade Card)</li></ul></li><li>Game storage: <ul><li>HuCard: Up to 2.5 MB</li><li>CD-ROM: 540 MB (requires TurboGrafx-CD)</li></ul></li><li>Save data: <ul><li>Internal memory: 2 KB (base), 192 KB (TurboDuo)</li><li>Additional memory: Memory Base 128 device</li></ul></li></ul><h2>External links</h2><ul><li><a href="http://www.1up.com/features/20-years-turbografx-16-retrospective" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">20 Years of Turbo Power</a>, 1UP</li><li><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2012/11/feature_the_making_of_the_pc_engine" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">Feature: The Making of the PC Engine</a>, Nintendo Life</li><li><a href="http://www.racketboy.com/retro/turbografx-16/tubrografix-16-tg16-101-beginners-guide" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">TurboGrafx-16 101: The Beginner's Guide</a>, Racket Boy</li></ul>]]></description>

It was released on November 19, 1998 in North America, on October 21, 1998 in Japan, on November 23, 1998 in Europe, and in 1999 in Australia. Unlike its predecessor, it featured a color screen. It was smaller than the original Game Boy, but slightly larger than the Game Boy Pocket. The Game Boy Color only used 2 AA batteries as compared to the originals 4, and the Game Boy Pocket's 2 AAA's. Combined sales of the Game Boy and Game Boy Color were charted at 118.69 million worldwide. Total Sales for Japan reached 32.47 million units, 44.06 million in the the Americas, and 2.16 million in other regions.</p><p style="">The Game Boy Color was originally a response by Nintendo from the pressure of developers for new and more sophisticated hardware. Developers felt that the Game Boy, and even the recently released Game Boy Pocket, were far too simple and stifled creative ability. To combat this, Nintendo released the Game Boy Color. The Game Boy Color was the first handheld video game console to be <a href="/backwards-compatibility/3015-1053/" data-ref-id="3015-1053">backwards compatible</a>, meaning that original Game Boy games could be played on it. This has since become a standard in the Game Boy line. The Color boasted a processor twice as powerful as its predecessor, as well as four times the available system memory. This allowed for developers to create much larger and longer games than possible with the original systems specifications.</p><h3>Cartridge Types</h3><p style="">Many games released during the Game Boy Color's run were developed to be still be compatible with the older Game Boy classic and Game Boy Pocket. Cartridges that were backwards-compatible with the older hardware kept the traditional Game Boy cartridge shape, but were colored black instead of the traditional gray. Games exclusive to the Color, however, were released in a clear cartridge with a bulging extraction grip, as opposed to the traditional indented one.</p><h2>Launch Titles</h2><h3>Japan</h3><ul><li><a href="/dragon-warrior-monsters/3030-13470/" data-ref-id="3030-13470">Dragon Warrior Monsters</a></li><li><a href="/hexcite-the-shapes-of-victory/3030-871/" data-ref-id="3030-871">Hexcite</a></li><li>Pocket Bowling</li><li><a href="/tetris-dx/3030-796/" data-ref-id="3030-796">Tetris DX</a></li><li><a href="/wario-land-ii/3030-13721/" data-ref-id="3030-13721">Wario Land II</a></li></ul><h3>North America</h3><ul><li><a href="/centipede/3030-1157/" data-ref-id="3030-1157">Centipede</a></li><li><a href="/game-watch-gallery-2/3030-9957/" data-ref-id="3030-9957">Game &amp; Watch Gallery 2</a></li><li><a href="/pocket-bomberman/3030-23456/" data-ref-id="3030-23456">Pocket Bomberman</a></li><li><a href="/tetris-dx/3030-796/" data-ref-id="3030-796">Tetris DX</a></li></ul><h3>Europe</h3><ul><li><a href="/tetris-dx/3030-796/" data-ref-id="3030-796">Tetris DX</a></li><li><a href="/game-watch-gallery-2/3030-9957/" data-ref-id="3030-9957">Game and Watch Gallery 2</a></li><li><a href="/centipede/3030-1157/" data-ref-id="3030-1157">Centipede</a></li><li><a href="/pocket-bomberman/3030-23456/" data-ref-id="3030-23456">Pocket Bomberman</a></li></ul><h2>Hardware Specifications</h2><ul><li>Processor - Similar to the Z80, manufactured by Sharp with some bit manipulation</li><li>Clock Speed - 8 MHz</li><li>Memory - 32 kilobytes of system RAM, 16 kilobytes of video RAM</li><li>Screen Resolution - 160x144 pixels</li><li>Colors - 56 simultaneously onscreen from a palette of 32,768 colors</li></ul><h3>Colors</h3><p style="">Several different colors of the system was produced, many being limited or special editions.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/813166-10351_gbc.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-813166" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.6764705882353" data-width="238" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 238px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:167.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/813166-10351_gbc.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-813166"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/813166-10351_gbc.jpg"></a><figcaption>Pokémon edition</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Berry</li><li>Grape</li><li>Kiwi</li><li>Dandelion</li><li>Teal</li><li>Atomic Purple</li><li><a href="/pokemon-goldsilver/3030-8210/" data-ref-id="3030-8210">Pokémon Gold/Silver</a> edition</li><li><a href="/pokemon/3025-452/" data-ref-id="3025-452">Pokémon</a> edition</li><li>Pokémon Center edition</li><li><a href="/hello-kitty/3025-1151/" data-ref-id="3025-1151">Hello Kitty</a> edition (Japan only)</li><li>Clear (Japan only)</li><li>Clear black</li><li>Clear green (Japan only)</li><li>Midnight blue</li><li>Ice blue</li><li>Clear orange (Japan only)</li><li>Clear blue</li><li>Tommy Hilfiger Edition</li></ul><h2>Games</h2><p style="">The Game Boy Color featured an extremely robust library.

Following the absolute failure of the Commodore Plus/4 line, and the <a href="/amiga/3045-1/" data-ref-id="3045-1">Commodore Amiga</a> struggling in the midst of growing market competition as well as an anemic marketing campaign by Commodore the need for a new and more successful line of Commodore computers on par with the <a href="/commodore-64/3045-14/" data-ref-id="3045-14">Commodore 64</a> (C64) was apparent. However things were quickly becoming more and more difficult for Commodore management to design and market a new computer. Firstly CBM was dealing with a management crises following the loss of the visionary, albeit controversial, <a href="/jack-tramiel/3040-98032/" data-ref-id="3040-98032">Jack Tramiel</a> and his ascension to the top position at Atari (CBM’s prime competitor following <a href="/apple-inc/3010-5815/" data-ref-id="3010-5815">Apple</a> and <a href="/ibm/3010-190/" data-ref-id="3010-190">IBM</a>). With that the new management lacked the vision and business experience that allowed Tramiel to make CBM the dominate force in the PC market. Couple this with increased market competition CBM was quickly loosing its market dominance in the personal computer market. Companies such as Apple, IBM, and Atari were quickly making a dent in CBM's foothold. As such financially CBM was not on the solid ground that it was accustomed to.</p><p style="">It was under these troubled circumstances that Commodore Business Machines decided to invest the money to design and market the Commodore 128 (C128). In doing so they had hoped to regain their foothold in the personal computer market and finally restore their dominance from back when the C64 had first debuted.</p><h2>Design</h2><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/1679245-bilherd.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1679245" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.5452436194896" data-width="431" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 431px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:154.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/1679245-bilherd.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1679245"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/8273/1679245-bilherd.jpg"></a><figcaption>Bill Herd, the Mastermind Behind the C128.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The design of the C128 was the brainchild of computer engineer Bil Herd. A young and up and coming engineer Bil Herd had quickly ascended to the Lead Engineering position in Commodore for his vocal and vehement criticism of the Plus/4 management team. From the start Herd learned from the Plus/4 line’s greatest mistake and made full compatibility with C64 software a feature in the C128 from the start. As such it could play any cartridges intended for the C64 and could understand any code programmed in older versions of Commodore Basic.</p><p style="">One of the most important aspects of the C128’s design was the fact that it utilized multiple central processing units to allow for multiple applications. The C128 had two CPUs: a 2 MHz MOS 8502 processor and a 4 MHz Zilog Z80A processor. While the C128 had multiple processors this does not mean that it was a true multiprocessor as the C128 was unable to utilize both processors simultaneously. There was a reason for this. Lead engineer Herd used the MOS processor to run the C64 and C128 mode whereas the Zilog processor ran the CP/M mode. CP/M was a popular operating system specifically designed for business functions and applications. In the minds of Commodore’s management team by having business functions integrated into the C128 allowed for them to market the C128 as a versatile all purpose PC. In order to boot up this mode a user was required to insert a CP/M boot up disk. However a consequence of this design meant that the C128 was an expensive and complex computer to manufacture.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/1679248-c128_80col_basic_screen_shot.gif" data-ref-id="1300-1679248" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.38191881918819" data-width="542" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 542px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:38.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/1679248-c128_80col_basic_screen_shot.gif" data-ref-id="1300-1679248"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/8273/1679248-c128_80col_basic_screen_shot.gif" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/8273/1679248-c128_80col_basic_screen_shot.gif"></noscript></a><figcaption>The C128 Basic Start Up Screen</figcaption></figure><p style="">As for the specifications for the C128 it was an improvement across all boards in comparison to the C64. It had an MOS 8563 integrated circuit which had 16 colors and used an improved SIDs chip which was capable of 4 waves. It also had an impressive amount of RAM for a computer at the time. However getting to this point proved to be a difficult and costly experience for everyone involved in Commodore. The multiple processor design led to many issues that Bil Herd’s engineering team struggled to deal with. Many prototypes (even in the later design stage) had the catastrophic tendency to catch on fire or explode. Not only was that but the yield on their video cards was extremely low for their prototypes (as low .01%). Due to facing many processor bugs the production was delayed and expensive and the engineering team barely made CES 1985 reveal.</p><h2>Marketing</h2><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/1679240-c128_ad_vs_apple_iic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1679240" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.3433835845896" data-width="597" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 597px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:134.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/1679240-c128_ad_vs_apple_iic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1679240"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/8273/1679240-c128_ad_vs_apple_iic.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/8273/1679240-c128_ad_vs_apple_iic.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>A Marketing Poster Directed at the Apple II</figcaption></figure><p style="">The technical complexity of the C128 not only led to engineering issues but also marketing issues. The idea of a computer being a multi-functioning unit was still a new concept for the PC market as many consumers still owned or used specialized business computers for work and simple computers for home. Despite the versatility of the C128 CBM believed that marketing the C128 to the business computing market would be the most fruitful. However this deprived the C128 the mass appeal that allowed for the C64 to become the best selling computer in the mid eighties. By denying the C128 from becoming a gaming platform Commodore management also prevented it from being marketed as the “family” system that had really also allowed for the C64 to gain the mass appeal that made it the system seller and encouraged video game development for the computer. Also worth noting was that while it was present, the marketing campaign for the C128 was anemic and an all around weak effort by all accounts on the part of CBM management. Due to management not having the energetic driving force that Jack Tramiel provided during his time at the company the marketing was unable to really grab the attention of consumers like the C64 did.</p><p style="">Despite the fact that the C128 was an expensive computer to manufacture Commodore was fearful that if they were to price the C128 too high it would encroach on the Amiga’s high end personal computer market. As such the C128 was priced at $299.95 and the improved and updated 128D was priced at $499.95. This was despite the fact that it cost as much to manufacture as the Amiga 500 which was priced at $595.95. This meant that Commodore was marketing an under-priced graphical power-horse to businesses and families that didn’t need the multitasking or applications that the C128 had. It should be noted that the business computer market and family computer market were already inundated with cheap albeit more specialized varieties. As a result by being a mismarketed jack of all trades the C128 failed to appeal to any one market.</p><h2>Software Support</h2><p style="">As for video game developer support for the C128, it was a lack luster affair. Part of the reason for this was that the C128 was design specifically with the business market in mind and with the gaming scene as an afterthought. In total less than 50 games were released for the C128. In comparison to the C64 having over 10,000 commercial software titles published for it (over 2,000 which were video games), a significant failure for the C128. Similarly whereas the C64 and to a greater extent the Amiga where able to carve an active demo scene in the computer hobby world no such support would develop for the C128.</p><h2>Market Reception</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/1679242-c128_retail.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1679242" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.92901234567901" data-width="324" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 324px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:92.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/1679242-c128_retail.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1679242"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/8273/1679242-c128_retail.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/8273/1679242-c128_retail.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The C128 Retail Package</figcaption></figure><p style="">In total by the end of its production the C128 sold around four million units. While by no means a failure in comparison to the C64’s approximately 17,000,000 sold the C128’s market performance came as a disappointment to the management team at Commodore. As previously noted due to the C128’s low price Commodore Business Machines received a lower than usual profit per unit when C128s were initially being sold. Also worth noting is that the C128 was seen as the last computer that utilized CP/M. In less than a year after it was released CP/M use was being replaced by major businesses in favor of Microsoft DOS. As such Commodore’s hope that they would carve out a base in the business computer market completely failed.</p><h2>Legacy</h2><p style="">The disappointing performance of the C128 as well as the Amiga line struggling to maintain dominance marked the beginning of the end for Commodore Business Machines. While the company was once the manufacturer of the most popular line of personal computers in the United States and worldwide their management struggles and inability to deal with the changing personal computer market would market the death note for CBM. This machine would be Commodores' last 8-Bit computer; after this they would produce only 16/32 bit Amiga's and IBM PC clones. Five years following the discontinuation of the C128 line CBM would file for bankruptcy and sell the Amiga line to German PC manufacturer Escom.<br /><br /></p><h2>Technical Specifications</h2><table data-max-width="true"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Processors</strong></td><td><ul><li>MOS 8502 @ 2 MHz</li><li>Zilog Z80 @ 4 MHz</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><strong>RAM</strong></td><td><ul><li>128 kB system RAM</li><li>2 kB 4-bit dedicated color RAM</li><li>16 or 64 kB dedicated video RAM</li><li>up to 512 kB REU expansion RAM</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><strong>ROM</strong></td><td>72 kB</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Graphics</strong></td><td><ul><li>MOS 8564/8566 VIC-II E for 40-column composite video</li><li>MOS 8563 VDC for 80-column digital RGBI component video</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Display</strong></td><td>Text Mode: 80x25 or 80x50, 16 RGBI colors<br />Graphics Mode: 320x200, 640x200, or 640x400 (interlaced)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sound</strong></td><td>MOS 6581 SID synthesizer chip</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ports</strong></td><td>Serial, video (composite), RF video (TV)</td></tr></tbody></table>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style=""><a href="/snk-playmore/3010-616/" data-ref-id="3010-616"> SNK</a> released the Neo Geo CD in 1994, unlike many other CD consoles at the times such as <a href="/sega-cd/3045-29/" data-ref-id="3045-29">Sega CD</a> and <a href="/jaguar/3045-28/" data-ref-id="3045-28">Jaguar</a> CD, the Neo Geo CD was not an add on for the <a href="/neo-geo/3045-25/" data-ref-id="3045-25">Neo Geo</a> but rather a stand alone unit, nor did the system use extensive <a href="/full-motion-video/3015-604/" data-ref-id="3015-604">FMV</a> sequences or showcase new graphical effects that the base system couldn't do. Rather the Neo Geo CD was an attempt by SNK to correct it's biggest hurtle to entry for adopters of the original <a href="/neo-geo/3045-25/" data-ref-id="3045-25">Neo Geo</a>, the price of games. Carts for the original Neo Geo system were exactly the same as their arcade counterpart, this meant that they were a higher quality than most console games, but it also meant that they cost a lot more, new releases for the system regularly retailed for $100-$300 upon release. With the new CD format SNK could release home conversions of their arcade releases for a more reasonable price point at about $50-$60. Unfortunately, the Neo Geo CD had it's own problems, most notably load times that regularly lasted several minutes. Most of the systems library consisted of Neo-Geo ports with only a small library of games like <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/ironclad/3030-30585/" data-ref-id="3030-30585">Ironclad</a>, <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/crossed-swords-ii/3030-40322/" data-ref-id="3030-40322">Crossed swords II</a> and <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/shinsetsu-samurai-spirits-bushidou-retsuden/3030-33695/" data-ref-id="3030-33695">Samurai Shodown RPG</a> being exclusive Neo-Geo CD releases.</p><h2><b>Technical specifications</b></h2><ul><li>Processor: Motorola 68000 running at 12 MHz</li><li>Co-Processor: Zilog Z80 running at 4 MHz</li><li>Colors On Screen: 4,096</li><li>Colors Available: 65,536</li><li>Resolution: 304 x 224</li><li>Max Sprites: 380</li><li>Max Sprite Size: 16 x 512</li><li>Number of Planes: 3</li></ul><p style=""> </p><p style="">RAM specifications:</p><ul><li>68000 Program Memory: 2 MB</li><li>Fix Layer Memory: 128 KB</li><li>Graphics Memory: 4 MB</li><li>Sound Sample Memory: 1 MB</li><li>Z80 Program Memory: 64 kB</li><li>VRAM: 512Kb (For graphics attributes)</li><li>SRAM: 2 KB (For high scores / general save data)</li></ul><p style=""> </p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Backstory</h2><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/25/176130-o2_hard.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-176130" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0" data-width="0"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/25/176130-o2_hard.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-176130"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/25/176130-o2_hard.jpg"></a><figcaption>Odyssey 2</figcaption></figure>In 1976 <a data-ref-id="3010-2362" href="/fairchild-semiconductor/3010-2362/" slug="fairchild-semiconductor">               Fairchild Electronics</a>  rocked the video game industry with its invention of the ROM cartridge which was utilized in their video game console The Channel-F. The technological innovation lead to an increase amount of diversity in the video game industry in the form of videos games and the consoles that played them. However with innovation came adoption and after the release of the Channel F Atari came up with the Atari VCS (later renamed the <a data-ref-id="3045-40" href="/atari-2600/3045-40/" slug="atari-2600">     Atari 2600</a>).   <br/> <br/>However caught in the middle of all of this was the Magnavox reeling from the success of their non-programmable console the Odyssey. However by the time the Channel F and Atari 2600 had been released Magnaovx had already begun designing a new non-programmable console that would succeed the Odyssey. Forced to make an important decision Magnavox scrapped the design in favor of a cartride capable console in a darring attempt to break out of the over saturated dedicated console market. With expectations that technology would lead the console to sucess Magnavox released the Odyssey 2 with high expectations in 1978<br/><br/><h2>Technical Design</h2>The console that was released in 1978 differed greatly from the console Magnavox originally had invisioned. Firstly it was a programable console capable of utilizing ROm cartridges. Also the Odyssey 2's CPU could utilize background music scoring, better graphics, as well as better gameplay when compared to its predecessor. <br/><br/>The Magnavox designers also want to differentiate their from their competition in the form of how players actually palyed their game. Firstly unlike any other system at that time, the Odyssey 2 also included a full alpha-numeric touch pad keyboard. This lead to a small active group of developers for the console to design educational games for the console which would go onto to be a marketed selling point for the console.<br/><br/>For hand held controllers, the Odyssey 2 utilized the classic joystick design of the 1970s and 80s:  A moderately sized, self centering eight way joystick.  It was held in the left hand, and manipulated with the right hand.  In the upper corner of the joystick was a single 'Action' button.  A credit to the designers at Magnavox, three or four years later, with Atari, <a data-ref-id="3045-51" href="/intellivision/3045-51/" slug="intellivision">        Intellivision</a>, and a number of third party companies producing hardware, many people still felt that the Odyssey 2 joystick was one of the best designed.<br/><br/><h2>Sales</h2>While by no means a failure the Odyssey 2 had failed to really catch on the way other consoles had at the time. By the early 80's The landscape for video game consoles had greatly changed. Atari had gain a significant foothold on the market.

While the sales of these consoles grew greatly as months and years passed by usership of the Odyssey 2 had remained stagnant. Nevertheless various developers refused to drop support for the console. Developers such as<a data-ref-id="3010-48" href="/philips-interactive-media-inc/3010-48/" slug="philips-interactive-media-inc">        Philips</a> kept on supporting the Odyssey 2 well until the death of the console.  With a slow but steady stream of of games being released for the console as well as a child and educational friendly image the console sold around one million units in the United States.<br/> <br/> <figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14011/1361216-videopac_poster.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1361216" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="medium" data-ratio="1.4925373134328" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:149.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14011/1361216-videopac_poster.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1361216"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14011/1361216-videopac_poster.jpg"></a><figcaption>Video Pac Game Leaflet</figcaption></figure>     As for overseas sales the Odyssey 2  started the unusual trend (i.e.<a data-ref-id="3045-8" href="/sega-master-system/3045-8/" slug="sega-master-system">    Sega Master System</a>)  of consoles that did poorly in the States that going onto be suprise successes in other overseas markets.Part of the reason for this was that the European release for the console was marketed and planned out by Magnavox's parent company and electronics giant Philips Electronics.  In Europe (and in other parts of the world as well) the Odyssey 2 was sold as the Philips G7000 Videopac console. In France, it was known as the Philips C52.  In Brazil it was known as the Odyssey, as the original Odyssey was never released in Brazil. Total overseas sales reached over one million units.<br/><br/><h2>Technical Specifications</h2><ul class="plain-list"><li>CPU: 8-bit Intel processor running at 1.79 MHz</li> <li>Memory: 64 bytes CPU-Internal RAM, 128 bytes Audio/Video RAM</li> <li>Video/Audio: Custom Intel video and audio processor</li> <li>Video: 160 x 200 resolution, 15 color palette (sprites may only use a max of 8)</li> <li>Audio: Single channel, capable of noise output</li> </ul>]]></description>

      <deck><![CDATA[The TRS-80 was a very popular early microcomputer with standout features such as a full keyboard, included monitor, impressive floating point BASIC programming language, and a $600 pricepoint.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">The TRS-80 is a desktop microcomputer put out by <a href="/tandy-corporation/3010-1602/" data-ref-id="3010-1602"> Tandy Corporation</a> which was very popular in the 1970s and 1980s. TRS stands for Tandy Radio Shack, and the system is affectionately known as the "Trash 80" by fans. The microcomputer had important features such as a full keyboard, included monitor, well written floating point BASIC programming language, and a $600 price point. The computer was released in 1977, a couple years before Atari made games a driving factor for computer sales. As such, the TRS-80 was not generally a gaming platform and many games available for it use ASCII graphics or are simple text adventures. Sound was difficult to program, as was just about anything, so games with sound, such as Ball Turret Gunner, displayed it proudly on the box. The TRS-80s gaming problems were mostly fixed with the <a href="/trs-80-coco/3045-68/" data-ref-id="3045-68"> TRS-80 Color Computer</a> (CoCo) line which launched 3 years later. As the line progressed through the late 80s, Tandy faded into obscurity as <a href="/commodore/3010-2000/" data-ref-id="3010-2000"> Commodore</a> and <a href="/atari/3010-182/" data-ref-id="3010-182"> Atari</a> edged out ahead in gaming capability.</p><h2>Technical Specifications</h2><ul><li><em>CPU</em> - Zilog Z80 1.77 MHz processor</li><li><em>Memory</em> - 4 Kb / 16Kb</li><li><em>Video</em> - 128 x 48 resolution, monochrome TV monitor as display</li><li><em>Audio</em> - None</li><li><em>Media</em> - Cassette tapes via built in drive, floppy disk via expansion</li><li><em>Built-in Language </em>- BASIC Level I / BASIC Level II</li><li><em>Keyboard</em> - QWERTY layout with 53 full-stroke keys</li><li><em>OS</em> - TRSDOS</li><li><em>IO Ports</em> - Monitor, cassette interface, expansion port</li></ul><h2>Hardware</h2><p style="">The TRS-80 was released as a fully loaded microcomputer with a cassette drive, monitor, and keyboard. The basic model included a mere 4KB of RAM, while later models shipped with 16KB.</p><h3>Keyboard</h3><p style="">Data from the keyboard was read in a rather strange way on the TRS-80. The keys were mapped to pre-defined locations in memory and the computer would poll these locations to get the current state of the keyboard. The keyboards of the original TRS-80 models were generally regarded as poor as suffered from "keyboard bounce" which would result in duplicate letters accidentally being typed. To correct this problem, keyboard de-bounce software was distributed which made sure the keyboard wasn't polled too rapidly. This software was later build into the machine.</p><h3>Video</h3><p style="">Early TRS-80 models used a black and white RCA TV as a monitor, while later models switched to a more pleasant black and green. The TRS-80 could not display true, bitmap graphics, but instead used a subset of ASCII characters called semigraphics. The display featured 64 character columns with 16 character rows, and graphical software used ASCII characters and semigraphics. Semigraphics were characters formed as a grid of 2x3 blocks filled in 64 different ways. The 2x3 grid characters mapped out over the whole 64x16 display gave a virtual resolution of 128x48, all done with ASCII characters and semigraphics.</p><h3>Cassette Drive</h3><p style="">Programs were usually stored on cassettes, read by the built-in cassette drive. The tape deck included was just a standard monaural deck and the user had to manually set the volume while loading a program. If the volume was not correct while loading, the user would have to rewind, adjust the volume, and attempt to load again. Models with BASIC Level I read/wrote data at 25 bytes/sec, while models with BASIC Level II read/wrote data at 50 bytes/sec. No hardware controller existed for loading or storing data; the sounds were created electronically by switching the CPU voltage rapidly from negative to positive and back causing a click. Clicks were registered as 1s in the bit stream, while a silence was 0.</p><h3>Expansion Interface</h3><p style="">The TRS-80 expansion interface was an expensive but very useful option add-on that added a variety of features. They added 16k or 32k RAM, a second tape unit connector, a floppy disk controller, a printer port, a serial port, and a real time clock. The expansion interface was troublesome and was a leading cause of system crashes and lock-ups for a variety of reasons.</p><h2>Models</h2><h3>Model I</h3><p style="">In 1977, Tandy released the $599 Radio Shack TRS-80 around the same time as the Apple II and Commodore PET. It used a black and white RCA TV for a monitor, without a tuner. The Model Is were notorious for causing RF interference, so much so that some games were set up to output sound to an AM radio. The FCC eventually found the Model Is didn't comply with regulations and they were replaced with the Model III. Early Model Is had problems reading tapes from the cassette deck. The ROM was later modified to correct this, but users could get the problem fixed at a service center by having a small PCB installed.</p><h3>Model II</h3><p style="">The TRS-80 Model II was a business model released in 1979, and was completely different from the Model I. It featured a Zilog Z80A processor running at 4mhz, a Shugart 8" floppy drive, and an 80x24 monitor. The keybaord was detachable and it came with a standard printer port and 2 serial ports. Up to 4 floppy drives could be connected to one computer, each floppy holding 500k of data compared to the 87k of a Model I disk. The Model II used the TRSDOS-II operating system which made it largely incompatible with Model I software, and is thus considered a rather obscure TRS-80 model.</p><h3>Model III</h3><p style="">The Model III is the successor to the Model I and was released in 1981. It featured two 5.25" floppy drives that could convert Model I disks since difference in ROM made a few programs incompatible. The Model III also featured a better keyboard, build-in lowercase letters, and a faster processor: a Zilog Z80A running at 2.03mhz.</p><h3>Model 4</h3><p style="">The Model 4, released in 1983, includes two 5.25" drives, a 4mhz Zilog Z80 processor, and had an 80x24 resolution. It is fully backwards compatible with the Model III and emulates it perfectly. The Model 4 came with either 64KB or 128KB of RAM, and ran on TRSDOS 6.0, LDOS, or even CP/M. An upgrade kit for Model IIIs was released.</p><h3>Clones</h3><p style="">The TRS-80 was a moderately cloned computer seeing clones manufactured in South Africa, Hong Kong, North America, Brazil and Europe. A couple Model I clones, the Lobo Max-80 and LNW-80, even cloned the expansion interface. Some clones included all of the features of the Model III, while others improved the graphics of the Model I (Reducing TRS-80 compatibility). Tandy documented their computers and peripherals in very detailed diagrams in the system's manual, which may have been a factor in the amount of clones on the market. Unlike the ZX Spectrum, Tandy clones are no longer being manufactured anywhere in the world.</p><h2>Games</h2><p style="">The TRS-80 had a wide variety of games ranging across all genres. There were arcade ports, ports from other home computer games, and plenty of original titles as well. TRS-80 games are unique in their creative use of the semigraphics and low resolutions. Due to the various TRS-80 models, games were largely incompatible between systems, and as such there was no standard TRS-80 game that could be played on every TRS-80. Tandy garnered early support from big developers like Adventure International, SSI, and Avalon Hill.</p><h3>Notable Games:</h3><ul><li>Apple Panic</li><li>Arkanoid</li><li>Ball Turret Gunner</li><li>Demon Seed</li><li>Frogger</li><li>Missile Attack</li><li>Rear Guard</li><li>Rogue</li><li>Starcross</li><li>The Witness</li><li>Zaxxon</li><li>Zork</li></ul>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Formally unveiled in May 2003 and released direct via online order in October of the same year, the Tapwave Zodiac was a Palm OS-based "high performance mobile entertainment system" (read: a gaming-oriented <a href="/pda/3055-2775/" data-ref-id="3055-2775">PDA</a>) aimed at the 18-35 market.

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Summary</h2><p style="">The console that changed home video games as we know them, the Fairchild Video Entertainment System (VES), latter known as the Fairchild Channel F, revolutionized the video game industry. Its many revolutionary design properties marked numerous firsts in the video game industry.</p><h2>Background</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/10174-fairchild channel f.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-10174" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0" data-width="0"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/10174-fairchild channel f.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-10174"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/26/10174-fairchild+channel+f.jpg"></a><figcaption>Fairchild Channel F, promotional shot</figcaption></figure><p style="">By 1976, the <a href="/pong/3030-22195/" data-ref-id="3030-22195">Pong</a> and <a href="/shooting-gallery/3030-9438/" data-ref-id="3030-9438">Shooting Gallery</a> games dominating the video game market were becoming over-saturated with clones and cheap knock-off consoles. At this point, Fairchild entered the market with a new machine that attempted to differentiate itself by doing numerous new and exciting things.</p><p style="">The Fairchild VES was designed by <a href="/gerald-jerry-lawson/3040-100049/" data-ref-id="3040-100049">Gerald Jerry Lawson</a> and developed by <a href="/fairchild-camera-and-instrument-corp/3010-810/" data-ref-id="3010-810">Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corporation</a> through its well known subsidiary <a href="/fairchild-semiconductor/3010-2362/" data-ref-id="3010-2362">Fairchild Semiconductor</a>, a well known semiconductor company that continues to exist to this day. With the home video game market growing in leaps and bounds with the introduction of Pong, Fairchild was one of many electronic companies that wanted a piece of the market. Using one of their in house microprocessors, Fairchild Semiconductor set out to differentiate their console from the competition from the inside out, and in many ways they succeeded.</p><h2>Revolutionary Design</h2><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/1082936-channelfcontroller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1082936" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="2.4516129032258" data-width="62" style="width: 62px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:245.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/1082936-channelfcontroller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1082936"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8273/1082936-channelfcontroller.jpg"></a><figcaption>Channel F controller</figcaption></figure><p style="">The VES's overall look and design of the console was a fusion of new and established ideas. The console only resembled its competition from a superficial perspective. Any person who examined the console from the inside would see that that was not the case.</p><p style="">Firstly, the console featured detachable controllers which was a new concept when the console was first introduced. The controller had a grip on it to allow players to more easily play their games and it had only a few buttons to allow for games to be easily accessible. The controllers were connected to the console through dedicated 8-foot wires preventing users from losing their controllers.</p><p style="">However, the most important aspect of the Channel F's design lay in the way users started/booted up their game. Fairchild's new console featured plug-in cartridges that contained ROM chips. This cartridge based system was vastly different from the plug-in games for <a href="/magnavox/3010-1164/" data-ref-id="3010-1164">Magnavox</a>’s <a href="/odyssey/3045-74/" data-ref-id="3045-74">Odyssey</a> or <a href="/atari/3010-634/" data-ref-id="3010-634">Atari</a>’s Pong game system. This allowed Fairchild to be able to market their console as the home console with the most choices and longest shelf life. At the time of the consoles release the design differences worked and the console began outselling much of its competition. When first introduced, the Fairchild VES also retailed for $169.95; cartridges sold for $19.95 each.</p><h2>Atari Takes Notice</h2><p style="">With all of this <a href="/atari/3010-634/" data-ref-id="3010-634">Atari</a> had finally decided to release their own cartridge based home console called the “Atari Video Computer System,” (Atari retitled the console to the more well known name of <a href="/atari-2600/3045-40/" data-ref-id="3045-40">Atari 2600</a>). Despite changing the name of the console from the Fairchild VES to Fairchild Channel F to differentiate the console from Atari’s, the added competition had done its damage. With the release of the <a href="/atari-vcs-joystick/3055-785/" data-ref-id="3055-785">Atari VCS</a>, the Channel F was beginning to look outdated when compared to Atari’s console. Fairchild attempt to counteract this by introducing newer models of the console however this was met with mixed success.</p><p style="">However by starting this “console war”, Atari and Fairchild Semiconductors' war would have dire consequences for both of the companies. The release of Fairchild's system the year before and, and the subsequent release of Atari's system had set into motion what would become known as the "First Video game Crash." By making dedicated consoles all but obsolete, dedicated consoles were being sold well below their market value which in turn de-valued the video game market. With an overabundance of cheap video game consoles to choose from and the new hand held electronic gaming market (e.g. Simon, Mattel Football, ect.) emerging, Fairchild would go back to the semiconductor business and discontinued the Channel F by 1978 due to declining profits.</p><h2>A Second Chance to Succeed</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/1082927-system2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1082927" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.648" data-width="250" style="width: 250px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:64.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/1082927-system2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1082927"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8273/1082927-system2.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8273/1082927-system2.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>A Channel F-System II</figcaption></figure><p style="">Having lasted only a year and 4 months, from 1976-1977, one would have thought the Channel F's story would end there. However, by 1979, a company by the name of Zircon made a curious move; they bought all the rights to the Channel F and games released for the console. Later they re-released Fairchild F, but this time in the shape of a scaled-down model that was priced at $99. This system was dubbed the Channel F System II, and it lasted from 1981-1984. In fact some gamers who claim to have owned a Fairchild Channel F often don't realize that there were two different versions. Zircon would not only license their version of the Fairchild F in the United States, but would instead licensed the console all throughout Europe and Great Britain. In Germany it was dubbed the Saba Video Play, the <a href="/luxor/3010-813/" data-ref-id="3010-813">Luxor</a> Video Entertainment System in Sweden, and the Grandstand in Great Britain. This re-model shared some notable differences from its original counterpart but was ultimately the same console, especially seeing how it was backwards compatible with the System I games, but updated with more advanced technology. The System II model played sounds via the user’s TV set, rather than generating sound through an internal speaker built in the console. The Channel F System II also had removable controllers. This version of the Fairchild F saw various levels of success, but ultimately was discontinued as a result of the “Second Video Game Crash.”</p><h2>Legacy</h2><p style="">By 1978, Fairchild had released 23 games for the Channel F, with Zircon chipping in four new titles a couple years later. The games vary from single to multi-game cartridges, and the various options for the games are selected by the 4 main buttons on the front of the console. While its library pales in comparison to that of the 2600, it was large and comprehensive to that of the dedicated console market it had intended to attack.</p><p style="">It was the first microprocessor-based home system ever released, and microprocessors have remained the standard for all consoles and home computers released since. Being the first cartridge based console, the Fairchild Channel F would also establish cartridges as the go to format for console manufactures until the advent of the CD-ROM. An equally important thing to note about the release of the Fairchild is the effect it had on Atari. By posing a threat to Atari, the Fairchild Channel F would motivate <a href="/atari/3010-634/" data-ref-id="3010-634">Atari</a> to innovate and develop one of the most important video game consoles the video game industry would ever witness up until that time, the <a href="/atari-2600/3045-40/" data-ref-id="3045-40">Atari 2600</a>.</p><h2>Technical Specifications</h2><ul><li>CPU chip: Fairchild F8 operating at 1.79 MHz (PAL 2.22 MHz)</li><li>RAM: 64 bytes, 2 kB VRAM (2×128×64 bits)</li><li>Resolution: 128 × 64 pixels, 102 × 58 pixels visible</li><li>Colors: eight colors (either black/white or four color max. per line)</li><li>Audio: 500 Hz, 1 kHz, and 1.5 kHz tones (can be modulated quickly to produce different tones)</li><li>Input: two custom game controllers, hardwired to the console</li><li>Output: RF modulated composite video signal, cord hardwired to console</li></ul>]]></description>

Still enjoying the massive success from their last home console, the <a href="/atari-2600/3045-40/" data-ref-id="3045-40">Atari 2600</a>, Atari decided to produce a game system based on its popular line of <a href="/atari-8-bit/3045-24/" data-ref-id="3045-24">8-bit computers</a>, which were also quickly becoming a popular gaming platform. Games could be ported very easily from the Atari 400/800 line of computers to the Atari 5200. In the eyes of Atari management, this would encourage third-party development for the 5200 system as their 8-bit computers already had a dedicated group of developers. However the design for various parts of the 5200 would not only differentiate the console from Atari's own product line (Atari 2600, Atari400/800) but would also differentiate itself from its home console competition ( <a href="/intellivision/3045-51/" data-ref-id="3045-51">Intellivision</a>/ <a href="/colecovision/3045-47/" data-ref-id="3045-47">ColecoVision</a>).</p><h2>Hardware</h2><p style="">The largest difference between the 5200 from Atari's 8-bit computers and 2600 is the unique analog joystick. The controller allows for full 360-degree movement. Additionally, it has a second firing button and a keypad. The joystick does not self-center and is therefore prone to getting stuck, making it more difficult to play particular games such as <a href="/asteroids/3030-1034/" data-ref-id="3030-1034">Asteroids</a>.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/1081897-5200_controller_intro.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1081897" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.0228310502283" data-width="219" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 219px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:102.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/1081897-5200_controller_intro.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1081897"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8273/1081897-5200_controller_intro.jpg"></a><figcaption>The infamous 5200 controller</figcaption></figure><p style="">The 5200's keypad holds overlays, similar to the Intellivision's controller. Many Atari 5200 games came packed with overlays, as did third party games from <a href="/activision/3010-78/" data-ref-id="3010-78">Activision</a> and CBS, while Parker Brothers packed only Frogger with an overlay. Brands other than CBS include an overlay holder on the cartridge back. Another innovative feature of the 5200 controllers was the inclusion of a pause button, making it one of the first consoles to allow users to pause the action at any point.</p><p style="">The controllers were prone to failure. This led to several third-party vendors (most notably Wico) to release third-party controllers of varying quality and devices that would allow the use of the 9-pin 2600 joysticks on the 5200.</p><p style="">Later, Atari would release a <a href="/trackball/3015-2672/" data-ref-id="3015-2672">trackball</a>-based controller, akin to the <a href="/marble-madness/3030-9566/" data-ref-id="3030-9566">Marble Madness</a> arcade controller. Reception for this controller (officially called the Trak-Ball Controller), like the console itself, was lukewarm. The controller was as big as the console and was inconsistent in tracking movement. Atari later released a redesigned trackball controller with better motion detection and a more compact design, but by that time the 5200 had already failed to captivate audiences.</p><p style="">The original 5200 also came with a unique RF switch box that supplied power to the 5200 on the same cable that fed audio and video to the television. It reduced the number of cables running across users' floors, but was more expensive to manufacture and replace. The 5200 was incompatible with alternative adapters, making replacements harder to find. Atari later released a redesigned second generation 5200 system that was compatible with any normal power supply and RF switch box. The second generation 5200 had two joystick ports, unlike the original that had four (like the Atari 800 computer).</p><h2>The Games</h2><p style="">Far fewer games were released for the 5200 than that of competing consoles from <a href="/">Intellivision</a> and <a href="/">ColecoVision</a>. Few third-party game developers adopted the console because the 2600 already had 20 million users while the 5200 struggled to maintain 1 million users. Also development for the 2600 was cheaper and didn't require newer technology. The few games that were released for the 5200 were mostly designed or produced in-house by Atari. The console's short life span, due in part to the infamous game crash of 1984, curbed further growth of the console's game library.</p><h2>Reception and Market Failure</h2><p style="">The Atari 5200 was not well received by consumers when it was released and was never able to completely recover from its lukewarm reception. Various design and technical flaws, which ranged from an unreliable controller to an unusual RF adapter, discouraged users from adopting the console. The first wave of 5200s were also incompatible with 2600 games, requiring users to buy a separate adapter to play their back catalog of 2600 games. Atari officially announced the system was discontinued in 1984 upon the announcement of the <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/atari-7800/3045-70/" data-ref-id="3045-70">7800 </a>(which would not be released until two years later)</p><p style="">Beyond the hardware, poor business decisions helped further seal the 5200's fate. First, Atari failed to motivate third-party development for the console. Second, Atari management decided to devote most of their resources to the already oversaturated 2600 market while leaving the 5200 idle. Atari had numerous replacement consoles for the 5200 in the works before they decided to invest research and development into the <a href="/atari-7800/3045-70/" data-ref-id="3045-70">Atari 7800</a>. Atari Inc. originally planned on developing a smaller, cost-reduced version of the Atari 5200, which would have gotten rid of the controller storage bin. This prototype was called the Atari 5100 and would have been a more simple and user friendly 5200, but the project was eventually canceled. Before settling on the 7800 Atari's originally planned sequel to the 5200 was a system called the 3200, but its development halted because it was too difficult to develop for.<br /><br /></p><h2>Technical Specifications</h2><ul><li><strong>CPU:</strong> Custom MOS 6502C @ 1.79 MHz</li><li><strong>RAM:</strong> 16 KB</li><li><strong>ROM:</strong> 2KB on-board BIOS; 32 KB window for standard game cartridges.</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> ANTIC and GTIA chips similar to those in Atari's 400/800 home computers</li><li><strong>Sound:</strong> 4-channel POKEY chip</li><li><strong>Screen Resolution:</strong> 320x192 resolution</li><li><strong>Size:</strong> 13" x 15" x 4.35"</li></ul>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">The follow-up to the <a href="/trs-80/3045-63/" data-ref-id="3045-63">TRS-80</a>, the CoCo is actually incompatible with its precursor's hardware due to a completely different processor (Motorola 6809E vs. the Zilog Z80). This processor was actually more powerful than that used in many machines, which led to a higher price-tag and a correspondingly smaller user base.</p><p style="">The CoCo went through three revisions, taking it from the start of the 1980s through to the start of the 1990s. Impressively, each version had a high level of backwards compatibility with the software of previous revisions.</p><p style="">The CoCo line ultimately succumbed to the rise of the <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">IBM PC Clone</a>.</p><h2>Technical Specifications</h2><p style="">The CoCo 1 and 2 are largely identical under the hood, consisting of five LSI chips:</p><ul><li><strong>MPU:</strong> An MC6809E Microprocessor Unit that acted as the machine's brain.</li><li><strong>SAM:</strong> A MC6883/SN74LS783/SN74LS785 Synchronous Address Multiplexor that controls the DRAM, clock synchronization and a bunch of other tiny little things.</li><li><strong>VDG: </strong>A MC6847 Video Display Generator, capable of drawing graphics in up to nine colours to a 256x192 resolution display, supporting 16 lines of 32 characters on screen at once.</li><li><strong>PIA: </strong>Two Peripheral Interface Adapters, either MC6821 or MC6822 chips, handing I/O operations for cassete decks, the keyboard, and other things that plug into the machine.</li></ul><p style="">The CoCo 3 made a few more significant changes:</p><ul><li><b>ACVC:</b> A new ASIC-manufactured VLSI, dubbed the Advanced Color Video Chip, that integrated the capabilities of SAM AND VDG while enhancing their capabilities (for example, adding support for lower-case characters and 40-80 character displays).</li><li><b>MPU: </b>Bumped up to a MC68B09E.</li><li><strong>PIA:</strong> Bumped up to MC68B21s.</li></ul>]]></description>

In the eyes of <a href="/atari/3010-182/" data-ref-id="3010-182">Atari</a> management the Atari 7800 would be a return to form after the lackluster performance of the <a href="/atari-5200/3045-67/" data-ref-id="3045-67">Atari 5200</a>, as the Atari 7800 would address almost all of the shortcomings of the Atari 5200. However due to series of unfortunate events and ill-conceived business decisions the system wouldn’t launch until almost two years after its announcement. By this time <a href="/nintendo/3010-90/" data-ref-id="3010-90">Nintendo</a> and <a href="/sega/3010-62/" data-ref-id="3010-62">Sega</a> were dominating a newly rejuvenated home console market in the United States, but Atari still saw the opportunity to re-introduce the Atari name into American homes. Yet the Atari 7800 would mark a turning point for Atari as a console manufacturer as the console’s struggle to regain public popularity marked the eventual collapse of the Atari brand name and company as a whole.</p><h2>Backstory</h2><p style="">In July of 1984, the home video game division of Atari was purchased by the now infamous Jack Tramiel. Although the Atari 7800 was ready to go at this point, licensing negotiations had to begin again because the Tramiels did not agree with existing licensing arrangements, as a result the release of the 7800 was delayed. It was around this time that the video game market crashed, and retailers cut orders and shipments for video games across the board. As a result, by the end of 1984 the industry was left with only Atari, <a href="/coleco/3010-302/" data-ref-id="3010-302">Coleco</a> ( <a href="/colecovision/3045-47/" data-ref-id="3045-47">ColecoVision</a>), and <a href="/mattel-electronics/3010-460/" data-ref-id="3010-460">Mattel</a> ( <a href="/intellivision/3045-51/" data-ref-id="3045-51">Intellivision</a>) all of which decided to turn out new product for their old systems instead of developing new consoles, as such no new consoles were on the horizon for the United States. However Atari after spending the last two years working out the paperwork for the 7800s, by 1986 the 7800 was ready for release.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/1082812-scaleim.php.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1082812" data-size="large" style="width: 200px" data-ratio="1.385" data-width="200" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:138.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/1082812-scaleim.php.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1082812"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/8273/1082812-scaleim.php.jpg"></a><figcaption>One of the few third party games for the 7800</figcaption></figure><p style="">However, on October 15, 1985, everything changed.</p><p style="">Unbeknownst to Atari, a Japanese company called <a href="/nintendo/3010-90/" data-ref-id="3010-90">Nintendo</a> decided to bring their successful <a href="/nes/3045-21/" data-ref-id="3045-21">Famicom</a> console over to the United States. In their ignorance Atari management ignored the Famicom, and even skipped the chance to publish the American version of the Famicom. This mistake alone would prove to be one of the most costly mistakes ever enacted by Atari and even the video game industry.</p><p style="">Despite the fact that the American home console market was reeling from the video game crash of 1983, Nintendo still saw potential consumers. They were right; by 1986 the Nintendo Entertainment System had become an enormous hit with American consumers. With this in mind Tramiel and Atari continued with the release of the 7800, in hopes of reaping in the rewards of a newly awaken home console market.</p><p style="">At launch the 7800 had twelve titles ready to play. Also the system was completely compatible with <a href="/atari-2600/3045-40/" data-ref-id="3045-40">2600</a> games, a feature that the previous <a href="/atari-5200/3045-67/" data-ref-id="3045-67">5200</a> console lacked. The public was excited, and the 7800 was poised to take over the gaming world, but unfortunately it didn't quite happen that way.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/1082810-7800_ballblazer_intro.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1082810" data-size="large" style="width: 220px" data-ratio="1.2090909090909" data-width="220" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:120.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/1082810-7800_ballblazer_intro.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1082810"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/8273/1082810-7800_ballblazer_intro.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/8273/1082810-7800_ballblazer_intro.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Not exactly what we would call a "killer-app"</figcaption></figure><p style="">Instead Tamriel and the rest of Atari management would make various business mistakes with the release of the system. The first of which was the fact that Atari had failed to promote and captivate developers to adopt the system and develop games for the 7800. Instead Atari would concentrate on advertising the complete backwards compatibility the 7800 had with the 2600 games instead of the 7800's own library of games. In fact only 10 games were developed and released by third party developers for the 7800 during its lifetime, 6 from <a href="/absolute-entertainment/3010-666/" data-ref-id="3010-666">Absolute Entertainment</a>; 2 from <a href="/activision/3010-78/" data-ref-id="3010-78">Activision</a>; and 2 from <a href="/froggo-games-corporation/3010-3982/" data-ref-id="3010-3982">Froggo</a>. This meant that the 7800 would have to rely on in-house development from Atari in order to supply games for the system. However was not enough to compete with the NES’s or even the <a href="/sega-master-system/3045-8/" data-ref-id="3045-8">Sega Master System</a>’s rapidly expanding video game libraries. Also the launch for the system itself was poorly planned. Of the promised tweleves launch titles only three were actually available at the time of the system's launch. Not only that but the 7800 was poorly distributed amongst retailers making the system hard to find during its launch. As a result the 7800 was never able to recover from its rocky launch and in the end due to poorly conceived business decisions and a highly competitive console market failed to reach the market capitalization that Atari had hoped the system would obtain.</p><h3>US Cumulative Sales</h3><p style="">1986: <strong><a href="http://atariage.com/forums/topic/144552-happy-25th-7800-sales-figures-attached/" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">286,417</a></strong></p><p style="">1987: <strong>1,599,978</strong> (<a href="http://atariage.com/forums/topic/144552-happy-25th-7800-sales-figures-attached/" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">+1,313,561</a>)</p><p style="">1988: <strong>3,023,955</strong> (<a href="http://atariage.com/forums/topic/144552-happy-25th-7800-sales-figures-attached/" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">+1,423,977</a>)</p><p style="">1989: <strong>3,679,308</strong> (<a href="http://atariage.com/forums/topic/144552-happy-25th-7800-sales-figures-attached/" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">+655,353</a>)</p><p style="">1990: <strong>3,772,751</strong> (<a href="http://atariage.com/forums/topic/144552-happy-25th-7800-sales-figures-attached/" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">+93,443</a>)</p><h2>Design</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/1082807-7800_controller_intro.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1082807" data-size="small" style="width: 220px" data-ratio="0.88181818181818" data-width="220" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:88.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/1082807-7800_controller_intro.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1082807"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8273/1082807-7800_controller_intro.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8273/1082807-7800_controller_intro.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Atari Pro-Line Controller</figcaption></figure><p style="">At the time of its release, the 7800 was initially billed as a graphical powerhouse. The new custom CPU and MARIA graphics chip that would power the system were capable of moving up to 100 objects on-screen (drawn with a line-buffer) at the same time and capable of displaying up to 25 colors on screen out of a 256 color palette. However, the system suffered from poor audio quality due to the fact that the system utilized the same sound chip from the 2600.</p><p style="">The system is indeed compatible with almost 100% of the existing <a href="/atari-2600/3045-40/" data-ref-id="3045-40">Atari 2600</a> game library, and all the existing 2600 controllers and peripherals are compatible as well. The 7800 was also sold with its own special Proline controllers which were meant to be an improvement over the <a href="/atari-5200/3045-67/" data-ref-id="3045-67">5200</a> design. The controller was a two-button controller, allowing for greater functionality than the classic one-button from the 2600 days.</p><p style="">Along with inferior sound quality, the 7800 was also technically lacking compared to the NES in several other ways. The 7800's CPU and MARIA graphics chip both shared the same RAM memory address space, interrupting each other's cycles when attempting to access RAM and slowing down the system, whereas the NES had separate RAM memory address spaces for its CPU and PPU graphics chip, allowing both to run at full speeds. The 7800's coarse scrolling, with occasional 8-pixel jumps, was not as smooth as the NES's continuous pixel-by-pixel scrolling. The 7800 also lacked a tilemap engine like the NES, meaning the 7800 had to use more memory and processing to produce the same amount of graphics as the NES, and also had to draw tiled backgrounds using numerous sprites, slowing down the system and making it difficult for third-party developers to produce tiled <a href="/side-scrolling/3015-299/" data-ref-id="3015-299">side-scrolling</a> games for the system. While the 7800 had a 320x200 resolution mode, it was resource-intensive, so most 7800 games usually ran at the lower-resolution 160x200 mode (compared to the NES's 256x224 resolution).</p><h2>Legacy</h2><p style="">Sales from the console were middling outside of the United Sates. With numerous third party developers quickly dropping support for the 7800 and gamers everywhere ignoring the console as a whole Atari pulled the plug on the 7800 by 1992 and ceased all production of the console. In the end Atari was no longer the console manufacturer that it once was, but unconvinced by their failure Atari would make one <a href="/jaguar/3045-28/" data-ref-id="3045-28">last ditch effort</a> to regain their once dominant status in the video game console market.</p><h2>Technical Specifications</h2><p style="">* CPU: Custom 6502C</p><p style="">Speed: 1.79 MHz, drops to 1.19 MHz when the TIA or RIOT chips are accessed</p><p style="">(note: This is Atari's custom 6502 known as SALLY which can be halted to allow other devices to control the bus)</p><p style="">* RAM: 4 KB (2 6116 2Kx8 RAM ICs)</p><p style="">* ROM: built in 4 KB BIOS ROM, 48 KB Cartridge ROM space without bankswitching</p><p style="">* Graphics: MARIA custom graphics controller (halts CPU when in use)</p><p style="">160x200 (160x240 PAL) resolution or 320x200 (320x240) resolution</p><p style="">25 color palette out of 256 colors (16 hues * 16 luma), different graphics modes restricted the number of usable colors and the number of colors per sprite</p><p style="">Direct Memory Access (DMA)</p><p style="">Graphics clock: 7.16 MHz (halted when CPU in use)</p><p style="">* I/O: Joystick and console switch IO handled byte 6532 RIOT and TIA</p><p style="">* Ports: 2 joystick ports, 1 cartridge port, 1 expansion connector, power in, RF output</p><p style="">* Sound: TIA video and sound chip, same as the 2600.

      <deck><![CDATA[The Apple iPod is a popular MP3 player that garnered a bit of game support due to its large market.  Support for games never took off until the newer, touch-screen iPod Touch and iPhones were released, and development of iPod Classic games has ceased.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<p style=""><i><b>N.B.</b>:</i> <i>This page is <b>ONLY</b> for games released for the traditional click-wheel iPod, retronymed the iPod Classic. For iOS-based games, please visit the <a data-ref-id="3045-96" href="/iphone/3045-96/" slug="iphone">iPhone</a> platform page.</i></p><h2>Overview</h2><p style="">The <a data-ref-id="3010-5815" href="/apple-inc/3010-5815/" slug="apple-inc">Apple</a> iPod is a popular MP3 player that also saw the release of a few games. It was never intended as a real gaming platform but due to it's incredible popularity, hackers put homebrewed games on it, and eventually Apple released a proper games section in the iTunes Store. iPod games are not available at retail, only as digital downloads, and they are linked to the specific device once they are purchased. iPod games cannot be shared or transferred. No external controller is available for the Apple iPod, and most games made use of the clickwheel using innovative, and often considered lacking, control schemes. All iPod games were available for $4.99 each from iTunes.</p><h2>History of Games</h2><p style="">The Apple iPod first generation included Brick as a built in game, a simple <a data-ref-id="3030-13049" href="/breakout/3030-13049/" slug="breakout">breakout</a> clone that was playable while listening to music. Originally it was an <a data-ref-id="3015-2" href="/easter-egg/3015-2/" slug="easter-egg">easter egg</a> on the device, but in later <a data-ref-id="3015-1789" href="/firmware/3015-1789/" slug="firmware">firmware</a> updates it was added to the menu. The fifth generation clickwheel iPod devices shipped with 3 more built in games: Parachute, <a data-ref-id="3030-27477" href="/music-quiz/3030-27477/" slug="music-quiz">Music Quiz</a>, and <a data-ref-id="3030-5742" href="/microsoft-solitaire/3030-5742/" slug="microsoft-solitaire">Solitaire</a>. Parachute is similar to <a data-ref-id="3030-4062" href="/missile-command/3030-4062/" slug="missile-command">Missile Command</a>, in which the player controls a turret at the bottom of the screen and shoots incoming paratroopers. Music Quiz is a game that plays a clip of music from the iPod's library and asks the player a question about it. Solitaire is a portable version of the popular card game. The sixth generation iPod and newer iPod Nanos ship with Vortex, iQuiz and Klondike. In September 2006, Apple launched iTunes 7, and added the game store for clickwheel iPods fifth generation and up. Touch-screen iPods have an entirely different application store. iTunes 7 launched with <a data-ref-id="3030-14169" href="/bejeweled/3030-14169/" slug="bejeweled">Bejeweled</a>, <a data-ref-id="3030-8785" href="/cubis-2/3030-8785/" slug="cubis-2">Cubis 2</a>, <a data-ref-id="3030-8020" href="/ea-mahjong/3030-8020/" slug="ea-mahjong">Mahjong</a>, Mini Golf, <a data-ref-id="3030-7624" href="/pac-man/3030-7624/" slug="pac-man">Pac-Man</a>, <a data-ref-id="3030-1896" href="/tetris/3030-1896/" slug="tetris">Tetris</a>, <a data-ref-id="3030-9467" href="/texas-hold-em/3030-9467/" slug="texas-hold-em">Texas Hold 'Em</a>, <a data-ref-id="3030-9146" href="/vortex/3030-9146/" slug="vortex">Vortex</a> and <a data-ref-id="3030-17012" href="/zuma/3030-17012/" slug="zuma">Zuma</a> all for $4.99 each.</p><h2><b>iPod History</b></h2><h3>iPod "Classic" 2001 - Present</h3><p style="">Generations:</p><ul><li>One: 2001, 5 and 10 GB</li><li>Two: 2002, 10 and 20 GB</li><li>Three: 2003, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 40 GB</li><li>Four: 2004, 20 and 40 GB</li><li>Five: 2005, 30, 60 and 80 GB</li><li>Six: 2007, 80 and 160 GB</li><li>Six (Refresh): 2008, 120 GB (80 and 160 GB Models discontinued)</li><li>Six (Refresh 2): 2009, 160 GB (120 Slim body) (120 GB discontinued)</li></ul><h3>iPod Mini 2004 - 2005</h3><p style="">Generations:</p><ul><li>One: 2004, 4 GB</li><li>Two: 2005, 4 and 6 GB</li></ul><h3>iPod Shuffle 2005 - Present (no screen)</h3><table class="t-editor with-border natural-width"><tbody><tr><th>Generation</th><th>Years Released</th><th>Storage (GB)</th></tr><tr><td>One</td><td>2005</td><td>0.5, 1</td></tr><tr><td>Two</td><td>2006, 2007, 2008</td><td>1, 2</td></tr><tr><td>Three</td><td>2009</td><td>2, 4</td></tr><tr><td>Four</td><td>2010</td><td>2</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>iPod Nano 2005 - Present (use <a data-ref-id="3045-72" href="/ipod/3045-72/" slug="ipod"><b>IPOD</b></a> platform for iPod Classic compatible games)</h3><table class="t-editor with-border natural-width"><tbody><tr><th>Generation</th><th>Year</th><th>Storage (GB)</th><th>RAM (MB)</th><th>Display</th></tr><tr><td>One</td><td>2005</td><td>1, 2, 4</td><td>32</td><td>176x132 @ 151ppi</td></tr><tr><td>Two</td><td>2006</td><td>2, 4, 8</td><td>32</td><td>176x132 @ 151ppi</td></tr><tr><td>Three</td><td>2007</td><td>4, 8</td><td>32</td><td>320x240 @ 204ppi</td></tr><tr><td>Four</td><td>2008</td><td>8, 16</td><td>32</td><td>240x320 @ 204ppi</td></tr><tr><td>Five</td><td>2009</td><td>8, 16</td><td>64</td><td>240x376 @ 204ppi</td></tr><tr><td>Six</td><td>2010</td><td>8, 16</td><td>64</td><td>240x240 @ 220ppi</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>iPod Touch 2007 - Present (use <a data-ref-id="3045-96" href="/iphone/3045-96/" slug="iphone"><b>IPHN</b></a> platform for iOS compatible App Store games)</h3><table class="t-editor with-border natural-width"><tbody><tr><th>Generation</th><th>Year</th><th>Storage (GB)</th><th>iOS versions</th><th>RAM (MB)</th><th>Display</th></tr><tr><td>One</td><td>2007</td><td>8, 16, 32</td><td>1.1 – 3.1.3</td><td>128</td><td>480x320 @ 162ppi</td></tr><tr><td>Two</td><td>2008</td><td>8, 16, 32</td><td>2.1.1 – 4.2.1</td><td>128</td><td>480x320 @ 162ppi</td></tr><tr><td>Three</td><td>2009</td><td>32, 64</td><td>3.1.1 – 4.2.1</td><td>256</td><td>480x320 @ 162ppi</td></tr><tr><td>Four</td><td>2010</td><td>8, 32, 64</td><td>4.1 – 4.2.1</td><td>256</td><td>960x640 @ 326ppi</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Notable Games</h2><p style="">While the iPod gained develop support from popular developers such as <a data-ref-id="3010-382" href="/namco-bandai-games-inc/3010-382/" slug="namco-bandai-games-inc">NAMCO</a>, <a data-ref-id="3010-104" href="/square-enix/3010-104/" slug="square-enix">Square Enix</a>, <a data-ref-id="3010-62" href="/sega/3010-62/" slug="sega">Sega</a>, <a data-ref-id="3010-6256" href="/ea-games/3010-6256/" slug="ea-games">EA</a>, and <a data-ref-id="3010-419" href="/hudson-entertainment-inc/3010-419/" slug="hudson-entertainment-inc">Hudson</a>, the game library remained rather small.

      <deck><![CDATA[The Magnavox Odyssey was the first home video game console.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">The <a href="/magnavox/3010-1164/" data-ref-id="3010-1164">Magnavox</a> Odyssey is the very first video game system. It was released in Fall of 1972 and was designed by <a href="/ralph-baer/3040-89698/" data-ref-id="3040-89698">Ralph Baer</a> in 1968. The prototype Odyssey (referred to as the "Brown Box") that Baer got to work in 1968 is now in the Smithsonian Institute in Washington D.C.</p><p style="">The Odyssey's sales were poor due to bad marketing by Magnavox retail stores and the consumer misconception that the Odyssey only worked on Magnavox televisions.</p><p style="">Magnavox settled or won many court cases against various companies including <a href="/nolan-bushnell/3040-89534/" data-ref-id="3040-89534">Nolan Bushnell</a> for eerie resemblance between Bushnell's Pong and Tennis for the Odyssey.</p><p style="">The Odyssey also had the first optical video game <a href="/light-gun/3015-2354/" data-ref-id="3015-2354">light gun</a>, which was made for the Odyssey game <a href="/shooting-gallery/3030-9438/" data-ref-id="3030-9438">Shooting Gallery</a>. However, you would not need to point the light gun at the screen to be successful. It would recognize any light source as the screen. This made it so pointing the gun at any light source would count as a hit.</p><p style="">In total the Odyssey had about 30 games. Most (if not all) of the games were built into the system itself. The system however used cartridges to tell the system which game (or series of games) to play.</p><p style="">Most of the games on the Magnavox bear little resemblance to the games of today. Most of the games were two player only, and consisted almost exclusively of two white blocks on the screen which the players could move via dial controllers. To get around the graphical limitations Magnavox included various <a href="/screen-overlay/3015-7386/" data-ref-id="3015-7386">overlays</a> with the various carts.</p><h2>Games</h2><p style="">A Simon-says type variant where one moves the white block to a part of a body on an overlay of a boy and a girl.</p><p style="">A roulette game where players placed a poker chip on a (physical) numbered sheet, and hope that the white block goes into their desired number on the overlay.</p><p style="">A 50 state educational game where one player would name a state and the other would have to place the white block so it would appear in the state on the overlay</p><p style="">Various shooting games where the white block would appear behind an overlay lighting up various targets.</p><p style="">And many more of that ilk. In fact other than a basic table tennis game (which would later be copied by Atari as "Pong") a majority of the games relied almost as much on the overlay and an imagination as it did on the image appearing on the television.</p><h2>Technical specifications</h2><h3>CPU</h3><ul><li>No actual CPU, just very simple logic circuitry.</li></ul><h3>Memory</h3><ul><li>Internal RAM: 64 bytes</li><li>Audio/video RAM: 128 bytes</li><li>BIOS ROM: 1024 bytes</li></ul><h3>Video</h3><ul><li>160×200 resolution (NTSC)</li><li>Simplistic Analog Video System</li></ul><h3>Audio</h3><ul><li>No Audio</li></ul><h3>Input</h3><ul><li>Two 8-way, one-button, digital joysticks. In the first production runs of the Magnavox Odyssey and the Philips 7000, these were permanently attached to the console; in later models, they were removable and replaceable.</li></ul><h3>Output</h3><ul><li>RF Audio/Video connector</li></ul><h3>Media</h3><ul><li>Cartridges contained a series of jumper circuits that connected different components on the main board together. </li><li>Did not actually contain any ROM or data of any kind.</li></ul>]]></description>

      <deck><![CDATA[The NEC PC-FX was a console designed in the form of a PC and planned to be upgradable.  It failed due to lack of 3D graphical power and little developer support.  The PC-FX is known for it's large percentage of adult titles and was NEC Corporation's last gaming console.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">The PC-FX was an innovative Japanese console released by <a href="/nec-technologies-inc/3010-1741/" data-ref-id="3010-1741"> NEC</a> in 1994. It is the successor to the NEC <a href="/turbografx-16/3045-55/" data-ref-id="3045-55"> PC-Engine</a>, and takes a new approach on the concept of the video game console. The PC-FX was designed to be expandable, and is even shaped like PC tower, modelled after NEC's <a href="/nec-pc-9801/3045-112/" data-ref-id="3045-112">PC-98</a> computer platform. The unit plays <a href="/pc-fx/3045-75/" data-ref-id="3045-75"> PC-FX</a> games, audio CDs, CD Gs, and Kodak picture CDs. Due to the consoles failing sales, NEC allowed an abundance of adult games to be released on the console. An internal PC card was available for home <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94"> PCs</a> that let the PC play PC-FX games so the user did not need to purchase the console. The only other console in history with this feature was <a href="/matsushita-electric-corporation-of-america-panasonic/3010-1277/" data-ref-id="3010-1277"> Panasonic</a>'s <a href="/3do/3045-26/" data-ref-id="3045-26"> 3DO</a> (with the 3DO Blaster ).</p><h2>Hardware</h2><p style="">The case of the PC-FX is shaped like a computer and was designed to be an upgradeable console. The hardware, designed in 1992, was codenamed "Iron Man" and was supposed to be implemented in a new console to replace the <a href="/turbografx-16/3045-55/" data-ref-id="3045-55"> PC-Engine</a> after it was developed. PC-Engine developers were upset that <a href="/nec-technologies-inc/3010-1741/" data-ref-id="3010-1741"> NEC</a> was releasing a new console when the market was still expanding so NEC held out another two years while continuing to support the PC-Engine. In 1994, NEC receieved pressure from <a href="/3do/3045-26/" data-ref-id="3045-26"> 3DO</a>, <a href="/sega/3010-62/" data-ref-id="3010-62"> Sega</a>, and <a href="/sony-corporation/3010-3223/" data-ref-id="3010-3223"> Sony</a> with new consoles on the horizon for that year. With few options, the severely outdated Iron Man hardware was used to make the PC-FX, with the intentions of releasing a 3D expansion to compensate for the unit's underpowered graphics. Develops failed to produce titles for the underpowered system, and as a result, the lackluster game library made it unattractive to consumers. A key feature of the PC-FX is it's advanced JPEG decoding ability. It has the ability to decompress video at 30 frames per second with digital audio playing simultaneously. PC-FX games enjoyed the best <a href="/full-motion-video/3015-604/" data-ref-id="3015-604"> FMVs</a> in console history up until 1998 when the <a href="/playstation/3045-22/" data-ref-id="3045-22"> Playstation</a> had better image quality, but still a poorer framerate. While the PC-FX could not handle 3D graphics some effects it could handle are rotation, magnification, reduction, cellophane, fade, and priority. The controller was a fairly standard 6-button controller; the console is also notable for being the first console compatible with a mouse.</p><p style="">The three expansion slots on the console are severely underused for a console marketed as being upgradable similar to a PC. An expansion slot on the front console only had one peripheral released that used it, the FX-BMP memory expansion module. It was simply a memory card that allowed players to save their data onto a portable device rather than internal memory. Expansion ports on the bottom and back of the unit were used to connect to PC-9800 computers, and let the PC-FX be used as an SCSI CD-Rom drive. The 3D expansion module was never released, nor were any upgrades and as a result, the PC-FX remained one of the least powerful consoles on the market. A small panel on the back of the console contains AV jacks, an S-Video jack, and the power connection. The PC-FX doesn't have an opening CD-Rom drive, but rather the top of the unit flips up and a CD is placed in it much like a Sega CD.</p><p style="">The PC-FX has no copy protection built into it because of the high price of CD burners and writable media at the time of release. This was fairly standard for CD-based consoles at the time.</p><p style="">The PC-FX card for PCs was available for either DOS or PC-9800. It came with 2 CDs used for PC-FX development. Unfortunately, programmed games would not work in retail consoles due to compatibility issues.</p><h3>Technical Specifications</h3><p style=""><em>CPU </em>- 32-bit NEC V810 RISC processor running at 21.5MHz</p><p style=""><em>Memory </em>- 2MB</p><p style=""><em>VRAM</em> - 1.25MB</p><p style=""><em>Back-up RAM</em> - 32KB</p><p style=""><em>ROM </em>- 1MB</p><p style=""><em>Video Resolution</em> - 640x480</p><p style=""><em>Sound </em>- 16-bit stereo w/2 ADPCM channels and 6 sample channels at 44.1kHz</p><p style=""><em>ODD </em>- 2x CD-ROM drive supporting FX-CD, CD-DA, CD G, CD EG, and Photo CD</p><p style=""><em>IO</em> - Composite, S-Video, 2 controller inputs</p><p style=""><em>Expansion </em>- EXT1 (Back-up memory), EXT2 (Extra functions), EXT3 (Memory expansion)</p><p style=""><em>Size/Weight </em>- 132 x 267 x 244 mm / 2.9kg</p><p style=""><em>Power Consumption</em> - 16W / AC 100V</p><h2>Software</h2><p style="">The PC-FX has somewhat of a reputation for having a higher percentage of adult titles than any other console. Due to poor sales, <a href="/nec-technologies-inc/3010-1741/" data-ref-id="3010-1741"> NEC</a> was rather lenient with what they let be developed for the console. It launched with Graduation 2: Neo Generation FX, <a href="/battle-heat/3030-27416/" data-ref-id="3030-27416"> Battle Heat</a> and Team Innocent in 1994. Besides hentai games and dating sims, there were also action games, strategy games, and RPGs. Being a Japanese exclusive console with a library consisting of mostly text-heavy adult games and RPGs, most games are not playable by an English speaking player. Most games do have Japanese voiceovers, for nearly all spoken text in fact, so players who have phonetically learned Japanese may be able to understand dialouge. Only 62 games ever appeared on the PC-FX.</p><h2>Rumored/Unreleased Games</h2><h3><a href="/fx-fighter/3030-11081/" data-ref-id="3030-11081"> <b> </b><b> FX Fighter</b></a></h3><p style="">FX Fighter was a demonstration used to promote the PC-FX and it's graphical capabilities. A demo was shown at the Tokyo Toy Show in 1994, and the game seemed playable although is unknown whether it was actually playable or an elaborate set of full motion videos. The game was a 1-on-1 3D fighter which used FMV to represent the characters movement. The game was cancelled halfway through development with only 3 or 4 characters done because the sheer size of the FMVs needed to complete the game exceeded the capacity of a single CD.</p><h3>Lords of Thunder FX</h3><p style="">There is little info about Lords of Thunder FX other than the fact that a tech demo existed. Some Japanese gaming magazines were shown a polygonal rendering of a boss from the original <a href="/lords-of-thunder/3030-16979/" data-ref-id="3030-16979"> Lords of Thunder</a> released on TurboDuo. It is unknown if the released picture was a playable game, a simple rendering, or even planned for release at all.</p><h3>Super Star Soldier 3D</h3><p style="">Along with Lords of Thunder FX, NEC released photos of an upgraded <a href="/super-star-soldier/3030-3973/" data-ref-id="3030-3973"> Super Star Soldier </a>supposedly on the PC-FX. There is little information about it other than that it is a Star Soldier game with better graphics. In 1994, EDGE released a single screenshot of Super Star Soldier 3D which shows the back of a 3D modelled ship flying in a 3D environment. If the shot is real, it shows that the PC-FX was capable of rendering 3D polygons in real time, but no further info on the game or 3D rendering was ever available.</p><h3>Hi-Ten Bomberman</h3><p style="">Hi-Ten Bombeman was originally planned for the PC-FX, and is believed to be an early version of <a href="/saturn-bomberman/3030-17854/" data-ref-id="3030-17854"> Saturn Bomberman</a>. The game is a 10 player version of Bomberman, and is notable for being what would have been the first game formatted for wide screen HDTVs. The game was apparently near completion when NEC canceled the release due to publishing guidelines.</p><h3><a href="/tengai-makyou-iii-namida/3030-5171/" data-ref-id="3030-5171"> <b> </b><b> Tengai Makyou III: NAMIDA</b></a></h3><p style="">Tengai Makyou III: NAMIDA (Far East of Eden) was a continuation of the popular Tengai Makyou RPG series. It was a highly anticipated game canceled due to the failure of the console. The game was announced in 1995 and development ceased at a very late stage. The project was not picked up again for years but <a href="/hudson-entertainment-inc/3010-419/" data-ref-id="3010-419"> Hudson</a> eventually released a vastly upgraded version of the game on <a href="/playstation-2/3045-19/" data-ref-id="3045-19"> PS2</a> under the same name.</p><h3>Masters Tournament Augusta</h3><p style="">Masters Tournament was a planned PC-FX golf game. The developed held back to see if the PC-FX would fail, and when it did, canceled the game.</p><h3>Pebble Beach No Hatou</h3><p style="">Pebble Beach was the planned sequel to Masters Tournament. It was ported to <a href="/sega/3010-62/" data-ref-id="3010-62"> Sega</a> <a href="/saturn/3045-42/" data-ref-id="3045-42"> Saturn</a> and <a href="/snes/3045-9/" data-ref-id="3045-9"> Super Famicom</a> when the developer, T&amp;E Software, saw the PC-FX would fail.</p><h3>Street Fight</h3><p style="">Street Fight was an <a href="/full-motion-video/3015-604/" data-ref-id="3015-604"> FMV</a> fighter, similar to FX FIghter but with real people. Characters with digitized and the game was supposed to be as realistic as possible. It was never released despite being shown at the 1994 Tokyo Toy Show.</p><h3>Robot Fighter</h3><p style="">Robot Fighter was another fighter like Street Fight and <a href="/fx-fighter/3030-11081/" data-ref-id="3030-11081"> FX Fighter</a> which used <a href="/full-motion-video/3015-604/" data-ref-id="3015-604"> FMV</a> video to display two <a href="/3d/3015-1430/" data-ref-id="3015-1430"> 3D</a> modeled robots fighting each other. Like the other titles, it was never released, presumably due to CD space restrictions.</p><h3>Sparkling Feather 2</h3><p style="">Sparkling Feather 2 was a planned sequel to Sparkling Feather, another PC-FX game. It was never released.</p><h3>Virtual Invaders</h3><p style="">Virtual Invaders was a <a href="/space-invaders/3030-5099/" data-ref-id="3030-5099"> Space Invaders</a> style shooter that was scrapped early in development.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">The Game.com, released in 1997, was <a data-ref-id="3010-1715" href="/tiger-electronics-inc/3010-1715/" slug="tiger-electronics-inc">Tiger Electronics</a>'s attempt at creating a handheld that could directly compete with <a data-ref-id="3010-90" href="/nintendo/3010-90/" slug="nintendo">Nintendo</a>'s <a data-ref-id="3045-3" href="/game-boy/3045-3/" slug="game-boy">Game Boy</a>. It sported a few features that were years ahead of their time, including a <a data-ref-id="3015-2256" href="/touch-controls/3015-2256/" slug="touch-controls">touch screen</a>, two cartridge ports (although later models did eventually move back to a single port), and internet connectivity through an optional 14.4 kb/s modem.</p><h2>Launch Games</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id="3030-3407" href="/duke-nukem-3d/3030-3407/" slug="duke-nukem-3d">Duke Nukem 3D</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3030-27492" href="/indy-500/3030-27492/" slug="indy-500">Indy 500</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3030-22805" href="/lights-out/3030-22805/" slug="lights-out">Lights Out</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3030-8279" href="/mortal-kombat-trilogy/3030-8279/" slug="mortal-kombat-trilogy">Mortal Kombat Trilogy</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3030-3528" href="/tiger-casino/3030-3528/" slug="tiger-casino">Tiger Casino</a></li></ul><h2>History</h2><p style="">Since the company's inception Tiger had produced <a data-ref-id="3025-1183" href="/game-watch/3025-1183/" slug="game-watch">Game &amp; Watch</a> style handheld games based on popular film, television, and videogame licenses. They released a cartridge based handheld system called the <a data-ref-id="3045-103" href="/r-zone/3045-103/" slug="r-zone">R-Zone</a> in 1995, but it died out quickly as the <a data-ref-id="3045-3" href="/game-boy/3045-3/" slug="game-boy">Game Boy</a> had begun to all but monopolize the handheld market and the simpler titles Tiger had producing were unappealing to gamers. In an attempt to dethrone the Game Boy, Tiger released the Game.com in 1997 with a puzzle title, <a data-ref-id="3030-22805" href="/lights-out/3030-22805/" slug="lights-out">Lights Out</a>, as the pack-in game. With the licenses obtained for use in their Game &amp; Watch style titles still in effect the system had what could be considered a lineup full of killer apps, albeit all developed in house at Tiger. Popular console titles such as <a data-ref-id="3030-8279" href="/mortal-kombat-trilogy/3030-8279/" slug="mortal-kombat-trilogy">Mortal Kombat Trilogy</a>, <a data-ref-id="3030-1956" href="/williams-arcade-classics/3030-1956/" slug="williams-arcade-classics">Williams Arcade Classics</a>, <a data-ref-id="3030-2391" href="/sonic-jam/3030-2391/" slug="sonic-jam">Sonic Jam</a>, and <a data-ref-id="3030-19043" href="/fighters-megamix/3030-19043/" slug="fighters-megamix">Fighters Megamix</a> were released either at launch or shortly after alongside adaptations of popular Tiger handheld products including Henry and Quiz Wiz, plus a promotional booklet teased ports of <a data-ref-id="3030-8251" href="/road-rash/3030-8251/" slug="road-rash">Road Rash</a>, <a data-ref-id="3010-6255" href="/ea-sports/3010-6255/" slug="ea-sports">EA Sports</a> titles and games based on upcoming films such as <a data-ref-id="3030-13568" href="/batman-robin/3030-13568/" slug="batman-robin">Batman &amp; Robin</a> and <a data-ref-id="3030-4125" href="/the-lost-world-jurassic-park/3030-4125/" slug="the-lost-world-jurassic-park">The Lost World: Jurrasic Park</a>. (few of which were actually released)</p><p style="">Tiger also had something else up its sleeve for the Game.com - it was to be the first handheld system to feature internet connectivity. This was, in fact, the handheld's main selling point. Internet connectivity was not without its flaws, however; as the system was released a good while before "Wi-Fi" was a popular buzzword. Internet access required a phone cord and jack, as well as a bulky external modem, to work, plus users were required to use Tiger's own ISP to get online. Internet connectivity was also not up to par even with what you'd find on most cell phones today; while the Game.com was equipped with a web browser it only allowed users to access text-only versions of the webpage they wished to view, and interaction with the games themselves was relegated only to online scoreboards. Users could also check their email through the service, but due to the high cost of getting the Game.com online, adoption rates for the console's online services were low.</p><p style="">Later in the console's lifespan Tiger released a new, smaller version called the Game.com Pocket Pro. It featured a smaller screen, one cartridge port, a lit screen (in the first few production runs), and eliminated the console's internet functions. New games, including ports of <a data-ref-id="3030-9418" href="/resident-evil-2/3030-9418/" slug="resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a> and the modernized versions of <a data-ref-id="3030-25567" href="/centipede/3030-25567/" slug="centipede">Centipede</a> and <a data-ref-id="3030-24704" href="/frogger-3d/3030-24704/" slug="frogger-3d">Frogger</a>, were released alongside the console. In 2000, when both the original Game.com and the Pocket Pro failed in the marketplace Tiger pulled support of the system, leaving games such as <a data-ref-id="3030-16140" href="/metal-gear-solid/3030-16140/" slug="metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a>, <a data-ref-id="3030-14216" href="/castlevania-symphony-of-the-night/3030-14216/" slug="castlevania-symphony-of-the-night">Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</a>, Giga Pets, and <a data-ref-id="3030-13997" href="/george-foremans-ko-boxing/3030-13997/" slug="george-foremans-ko-boxing">Foreman Boxing</a> (supposedly with force feedback capabilities) unfinished.</p><h2>Legacy</h2><p style="">While the console was a commercial failure, internet capabilities in handheld gaming devices became a popular feature in later handheld consoles. The console also featured a touch screen before the <a data-ref-id="3045-52" href="/nintendo-ds/3045-52/" slug="nintendo-ds">Nintendo DS</a> made touch-screen gaming popular in the handheld market. The console's failure caused Tiger to leave the gaming market, however, and focus on developing consumer electronics aimed at children.</p><h2>Emulation</h2><p style="">In 2005, an online group referring to themselves as the "game.commies" announced they would be working on hacking the game.com platform to enable emulation. After several years, It was finally released to the internet and is now publicly available as of October, 2011.</p>]]></description>

      <deck><![CDATA[The Gizmondo is a failed handheld console, which launched in 2005. It was potentially revolutionary for having functionality such as GPRS mobile data connection, a camera, GPS, a multimedia player and of course game playing all in one unit.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>History</h2><p style="">Originally announced as the Gametrac, before being renamed after <a href="/gametrak-dark-wind/3030-7514/" data-ref-id="3030-7514">Gametrak</a> discovered the name and complained that the name breached their copyright, the Gizmondo was a multi-function handheld games device launched by a UK subsidiary of US-based Tiger Telematics in 2005. The device was intended to compete against <a href="/sony-computer-entertainment-incorporated/3010-995/" data-ref-id="3010-995">Sony's</a> <a href="/psp/3045-18/" data-ref-id="3045-18">PSP</a> and <a href="/nintendo/3010-90/" data-ref-id="3010-90">Nintendo's</a> <a href="/nintendo-ds/3045-52/" data-ref-id="3045-52">DS</a> but due to a limited release which initially only included the <a href="/united-kingdom/3035-492/" data-ref-id="3035-492">UK</a> (And only select retailers at that) and later limited availability in the <a href="/the-united-states-of-america/3035-396/" data-ref-id="3035-396">USA</a>, the console floundered.</p><p style="">The initial release of the console saw only two games, <a href="/fathammer-classics-pack/3030-18384/" data-ref-id="3030-18384">Fathammer Classics Pack</a> (A collection of 3 games from the <a href="/fathammer-ltd/3010-2877/" data-ref-id="3010-2877">Fathammer</a> games line) and <a href="/trailblazer/3030-6711/" data-ref-id="3030-6711">Trailblazer</a>. The latter game was more popular with users and throughout the life of the platform was one of if not the most popular game in the community. Gizmondo promised to bring more games including some which made use of the console's unique features (<a href="/colors/3030-22561/" data-ref-id="3030-22561">Colors</a> promised GPS-powered "Turf Wars" where players could fight for control of real-life areas, Agaju promised to use the camera for FPS controls and other augmented reality features), however only 14 games ever made it to release - and none which made use of the platform's unique features.</p><p style="">The console was released in the US exclusively through specific Gizmondo mall kiosks. Shortly after the US release, it was discovered that at least one of the big names (<a href="/stefan-eriksson/3040-89957/" data-ref-id="3040-89957">Stefan Eriksson</a>) behind the company and, by extension, the platform, were members of the Uppsalamaffian, a Swedish mafia. The company never recovered and at any rate had incurred massive losses. To make matters worse, the company began circulating images of an improved Gizmondo before the console even went on sale in the US. The Gizmondo WS (WideScreen) strongly resembled the PSP and its existence angered existing owners (In the UK) because they felt they had bought the wrong machine and were going to be left out in the cold. American buyers were promised "an upgrade path" to the new system, but what this was was never made clear. No such option was ever said to be available to UK customers.</p><p style="">At any rate, the console never emerged and likely never got beyond the concept stage. The company essentially "went dark" shortly after the US launch due to lack of funds and the company finally went into bankruptcy in February of 2006.</p><p style="">Since then, the console has been cracked and the community, lead by <a href="http://www.gizmondoforums.com" rel="nofollow">GizmondoForums.com</a>, have spent much time porting games, finding and releasing the console's lost commercial games (Chicane: Jenson Button Street Racing, <a href="/sonic-the-hedgehog/3030-2465/" data-ref-id="3030-2465">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>, Colors, <a href="/carmageddon/3030-18394/" data-ref-id="3030-18394">Carmageddon</a> and more) and creating all-new games and applications as homebrew efforts.</p><p style="">Some individuals think that the system failed because of its lack of games. With a catalogue of games like <a href="/alien-hominid/3030-17452/" data-ref-id="3030-17452">Alien Hominid</a> and <a href="/ssx-3/3030-17149/" data-ref-id="3030-17149">SSX 3</a>, the Gizmondo just couldn't compete with cheaper handheld systems like the Nintendo DS.</p><p style="">In 2008, Carl Freer (Gizmondo's Chairman and the platform's corporate champion) announced he had reached an agreement with the liquidators and planned to re-launch the Gizmondo brand with a new console. This eventually came to nothing. The planned new console had been based on the existing hardware, but running open source software.</p><h2>The Hardware</h2><p style="">The Gizmondo was essentially a WindowsCE .net HandheldPC, using the embedded OS to run a custom GUI. It sported a 400MHz ARM9 processor, a 2.8" 320x480 TFT screen and an <a href="/nvidia-corporation/3010-6345/" data-ref-id="3010-6345">nVidia</a> GoForce 3D 4500 GPU (The GPU initially delayed the launch as the developers decided to change from a 2D chip to a 3D to better compete with the specs of the DS and PSP). Other hardware features included a 0.3 Megapixel camera, GPS for navigation &amp; (In select - canceled - games) location-based gameplay and a tri-band GSM radio which was used to supply an internet connection for e-mails and to send and receive SMS/MMS messages. It was also intended to be used for certain aspects of multiplayer, though this largely failed to materialise. Note that whilst it had a SIM Card and a phone number, the console did not support voice calling or any kind of voice communication.</p><p style="">Additionally, the system featured a Bluetooth radio, primarily used for multiplayer gaming. Other I/O included a standard 3.5mm headphone jack (The console also shipped with re-branded Sennheiser earphones), miniUSB and an SD card slot which served as the primary storage for games, movies and music. The system, like those it competed with, used a rechargeable Lithium-Ion battery (Which was notably temperamental, sometimes only providing an hour's use off of a full charge if users did not charge it in regular charge, drain, charge cycles).</p><p style="">The battery was replaced in the US with a larger version to improve battery life. This necessitated a larger battery door, meaning US Gizmondos do not follow the same curvature as UK models - there is a large rectangular bulge. This new battery door also allowed the attaching of a wrist strap (Which was bundled) though. This model was never offered in the UK.</p><h2>Smart Adds</h2><p style="">After the initial launch, users could receive a discount on Gizmondo hardware if they agreed to receive targeted, location-based advertising. This was also offered to existing users who received a voucher and accessories gift pack for signing up in lieu of the discount. Despite a system update which added a "Smart Adds" option to the menu, no ads were ever distributed through the service - which meant everyone who had signed up for the service got either a discount or their gift pack for absolutely nothing. Some people think even the thought of this was partially why the system failed.</p>]]></description>

Despite innovative display technology, various design and marketing mistakes doomed it to poor sales and quick retirement.

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/875642-virtual_boy_logo_copie.png" data-ref-id="1300-875642" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.2984496124031" data-width="258" style="width: 258px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:29.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/875642-virtual_boy_logo_copie.png" data-ref-id="1300-875642"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/875642-virtual_boy_logo_copie.png"></a><figcaption>Virtual Boy logo.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The <a href="/nintendo/3010-90/" data-ref-id="3010-90">Nintendo</a> Virtual Boy was a portable game console that used a parallax effect to give the illusion of depth through rapidly oscillating mirrors in the unit itself. It is notable for being the first game console to display graphics in true 3D as well as being one of Nintendo's biggest market blunders. All Virtual Boy games are rendered in a monochrome red and are viewed through a dark, neoprene, binocular-like device, rather than a standard screen. The Virtual Boy launched August 14, 1995 carrying an MSRP of $179.99.</p><h2>Hardware</h2><p style="">The Virtual Boy's hardware is truly the core of the platform, as only 14 games ever made it to North America. It all works with high-resolution LED display technology developed by Reflection Technology Inc. Each LED display has over 200 lights that turn on and off rapidly to create the game's image, which reflect off the oscillating mirrors. The vibration from the mirror creates the apparent thickness of the image, which is actually simply a vertical line of LEDs. This image is then focused through the adjustable lens and passes into the player's eyes. To create the 3D effect, the image in one of the eyes is shifted over using a technique called interocular distance. Each LED has 4 shades of red and 32 levels of intensity. The process of rendering the image is very CPU intensive, as 2 screens need to be rendered at the same time.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/875643-mario_s_tennis_screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-875643" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.58333333333333" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:58.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/875643-mario_s_tennis_screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-875643"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/875643-mario_s_tennis_screenshot.png"></a><figcaption>Mario's Tennis running on an emulator, simulating the "3D" look.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Nintendo never explained why they designed Virtual Boy to render images in monochromatic red-on-black. One possibility is that it used LEDs instead of an LCD screen, which provide a much sharper contrast with the dark background. LCD screens typically require backlighting of some kind, making a multi-color display cost-prohibitive for the time. (Red LEDs are also the cheapest to purchase and cause less eye strain than other colors.)</p><p style="">The unit itself features 2 display tuning controls. One adjusts the inter-pupil distance, which is the space between the player's eyes. The other, a slider, controls picture clarity. When perfectly focused, the Virtual Boy produced a convincing 3D effect, with sharper resolution than contemporary handhelds like the <a href="/game-boy/3045-3/" data-ref-id="3045-3">Game Boy</a>.</p><p style="">The Virtual Boy's controller resembled a hybrid Gamecube/NES device, with A/B buttons, Start/Select, and dual 4-way directional pads mounted above pistol grips. Some games balanced 3D controls across both pads, with one controlling "forward-back" and the other "up-down." Others copied the same controls to left and right sides, allowing players to choose which they preferred. (For example, right-handed or left-handed.)</p><p style="">Nintendo announced a 2-player link cable at system launch for head-to-head play, but never released it. Their clip-on power pack, which allowed use of the <a href="/snes/3045-9/" data-ref-id="3045-9">SNES</a> AC adapter instead of 6 AA batteries, remains its only official add-on. The Virtual Boy's short battery life made this plug-in pack almost essential for extended play sessions, disappointing for a supposedly "portable" system. (Both power sources connect to a compartment under the controller itself.)</p><h3>Technical Specifications</h3><ul><li><strong>CPU</strong> - 32-bit RISC processor @ 20 MHZ</li><li><strong>Display </strong>- RTI dual mirror-scan, high-res LED displays</li><li><strong>Resolution</strong> - 384x224px (Each screen)</li><li><strong>Software</strong> - 8/16 Mb ROM game paks (<a href="/marios-tennis/3030-14178/" data-ref-id="3030-14178">Mario's Tennis</a> bundled at launch)</li><li><strong>Sound </strong>- Digital stereo sound</li><li><strong>Controller</strong> - Double-grip with two directional pads and 6 buttons</li><li><strong>Power </strong>- Six AA batteries (9V), SNES AC adapter (10V)</li><li><strong>Size/Weight </strong>- 14x10x7" assembled; 5lbs</li></ul><h2>Reception</h2><p style="">The Virtual Boy was poorly received in the market, selling just under 800,000 units. It is Nintendo's biggest and only true market failure. The main issues with the unit were obvious. The vibrant red color-scheme caused a strain on the eyes when used for periods as short as 15 minutes, third party support was nearly nonexistent, the two player link cable was never released, it received bad press, and due to the visor the experience could not be shared with others. The unit may also have been overhyped as a machine that projected 3D images into the air, which led to obvious disappointment. The solo experience is perhaps one of the greatest factors leading to the system's quiet demise. Players were unable to actually understand how a Virtual Boy worked by watching someone play, or even through descriptions provided in print media. To counter this fact, Nintendo partnered with Blockbuster to rent out units for $9.99 with 2 games. The campaign obviously never worked, and despite price cuts to as low as $30 the Virtual Boy only moved just under 800,000 units.</p><h3>Future of Gunpei Yokoi</h3><p style=""><a href="/gunpei-yokoi/3040-45151/" data-ref-id="3040-45151">Gunpei Yokoi</a> was virtually exiled from Nintendo after the flop of the Virtual Boy. He was well known at Nintendo for the <a href="/game-watch/3025-1183/" data-ref-id="3025-1183">Game &amp; Watch series</a>, <a href="/game-boy/3045-3/" data-ref-id="3045-3">Game Boy</a>, and <a href="/metroid/3025-3/" data-ref-id="3025-3">Metroid series</a>. The idea of the Virtual Boy seemed interesting and innovative, but pressure from Nintendo forced Yokoi to rush it out for Christmas, leaving the Virtual Boy in a prototype stage when released by Nintendo.</p><p style="">After the failure, Nintendo started to question Gunpei Yokoi's ability, and Yokoi lost his job soon after.</p><h3>Comparison to 3D Systems</h3><p style="">Despite the bad press it gets, the Virtual Boy is actually quite revolutionary. It easily bests the <a href="/vectrex/3045-76/" data-ref-id="3045-76">Vectrex</a> in terms of graphical quality and library size. It has a much sharper image and does not suffer from the ghosting problems the Vectrex does. It looks much better than Tomy 3-D, 3D <a href="/sega-master-system/3045-8/" data-ref-id="3045-8">Sega Master System</a> games and 3D <a href="/nes/3045-21/" data-ref-id="3045-21">NES</a> games. It was truly the peak of 3D graphics at the time.</p><h2>Software</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/677374-563927_54851_front.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-677374" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="1" data-width="310" style="width: 310px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/677374-563927_54851_front.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-677374"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/677374-563927_54851_front.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/677374-563927_54851_front.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The only Virtual Boy game that achieved critical acclaim.</figcaption></figure><p style="">With only 22 games released worldwide and 14 games in total released in the <a href="/the-united-states-of-america/3035-396/" data-ref-id="3035-396">US</a>, the Virtual Boy is a highly collectible system due to the ease in completing the entire library. Only one game is truly rare in North America, <a href="/jack-bros/3030-7506/" data-ref-id="3030-7506">Jack Bros</a>; a Treasure game that can fetch up to $100 in second hand markets. <a href="/waterworld/3030-9919/" data-ref-id="3030-9919">WaterWorld</a> is also notable for being considered one of the worst games of all time by many outlets, and is rather obscure as well.

Unlike most Virtual Boy games which focused on a single, repetitive concept, Virtual Boy Wario Land was a full-fledged 2D platformer which took advantage of the system's 3D capabilities by having a foreground and a background.</p><h3>Games</h3><ol><li><a href="/3d-tetris/3030-17439/" data-ref-id="3030-17439">3D Tetris</a></li><li><a href="/galactic-pinball/3030-20180/" data-ref-id="3030-20180">Galactic Pinball</a> - (Release game)</li><li><a href="/golf/3030-24167/" data-ref-id="3030-24167">Golf</a></li><li><a href="/jack-bros/3030-7506/" data-ref-id="3030-7506">Jack Bros.</a></li><li><a href="/waterworld/3030-9919/" data-ref-id="3030-9919">Waterworld</a></li><li><a href="/nesters-funky-bowling/3030-19789/" data-ref-id="3030-19789">Nester's Funky Bowling</a></li><li><a href="/virtual-bowling/3030-23176/" data-ref-id="3030-23176">Virtual Bowling</a> - (Japan only)</li><li><a href="/sd-gundam-dimension-war/3030-24224/" data-ref-id="3030-24224">SD Gundam Dimension War</a> - (Japan only)</li><li><a href="/virtual-lab/3030-23175/" data-ref-id="3030-23175">Virtual Lab</a> - (Japan only)</li><li><a href="/vertical-force/3030-10822/" data-ref-id="3030-10822">Vertical Force</a></li><li><a href="/panic-bomber/3030-3117/" data-ref-id="3030-3117">Panic Bomber</a> - (Release game in Japan)</li><li><a href="/space-invaders-virtual-collection/3030-24168/" data-ref-id="3030-24168">Space Invaders Virtual Collection</a> - (Japan only)</li><li><a href="/virtual-boy-wario-land/3030-2412/" data-ref-id="3030-2412">Virtual Boy Wario Land</a></li><li><a href="/insmouse-no-yakata/3030-24236/" data-ref-id="3030-24236">Insmouse no Yakata</a> - (Japan only)</li><li><a href="/virtual-fishing/3030-23174/" data-ref-id="3030-23174">Virtual Fishing</a> - (Japan only)</li><li><a href="/mario-clash/3030-7638/" data-ref-id="3030-7638">Mario Clash</a></li><li><a href="/space-squash/3030-16224/" data-ref-id="3030-16224">Space Squash</a> - (Japan only)</li><li><a href="/virtual-league-baseball/3030-23177/" data-ref-id="3030-23177">Virtual League Baseball</a></li><li><a href="/v-tetris/3030-12407/" data-ref-id="3030-12407">V-Tetris</a> - (Japan only)</li><li><a href="/marios-tennis/3030-14178/" data-ref-id="3030-14178">Mario's Tennis</a> - (Release game)</li><li><a href="/teleroboxer/3030-14650/" data-ref-id="3030-14650">Teleroboxer</a> - (Release game)</li><li><a href="/red-alarm/3030-12612/" data-ref-id="3030-12612">Red Alarm</a> - (Release game)</li></ol>]]></description>

SNK created the Neo Geo arcade and home system, as well as the Neo Geo Pocket Color's predecessor: <a data-ref-id="3045-80" href="/neo-geo-pocket/3045-80/" slug="neo-geo-pocket">Neo Geo Pocket</a> (of which the Neo Geo Pocket Color was fully backwards compatible). The handheld was released on March 16, 1999 in Japan and on August 6, 1999 in North America. The system was released exclusively on the online retailer eToys in North America for a retail price of $69.95. eToys also had six launch titles. The Neo Geo Pocket Color had six colors available at launch: Camouflage Blue, Carbon Black, Crystal White, Platinum Blue, Platinum Silver, and Stone Blue. The Neo Geo Pocket Color was later released in other major retailers.</p><p style="">After SNK was bought out by Aruze, they tried to make the console exclusive to the Asian market, by recalling consoles and games (they would be re-sold in Asia). Later in 2003, the back-stock of the North American systems and software began to appear on the market. These consoles came with six games (with no case or manual), including <a data-ref-id="3030-22465" href="/faselei/3030-22465/" slug="faselei">Faselei!</a> and <a data-ref-id="3030-17678" href="/the-last-blade/3030-17678/" slug="the-last-blade">Last Blade</a> (neither of which were released in North America).

      <description><![CDATA[<p style="">The V.Smile is a game system with an educational twist, the system is built for children 3-7 years old .  Titles come on ROM cartridges, which during a brain storming session by <a data-ref-id="3010-3249" href="/vtech/3010-3249/" slug="vtech"> VTech</a> employees became known as "smartridges".......just in case the user did not understand that titles were meant to have educational value. The system has simple large buttons for control to accommodate a child's reduced dexterity.  The system controller consists of one large push button in the middle of the pad as well as 4 smaller buttons above this larger button.  The four smaller buttons are color coded  and are used in various games to promote color recognition when answering questions or solving puzzles.  Also of note the joystick portion of the controller can be rotated along the outer edge of the push button portion of the controller allowing the user to use the joystick in the left or right hand depending on preference.<br/><br/>The V.Smile range of consoles are not region-locked. While the console itself come in NTSC and PAL versions and the BIOS on the consoles appear to be region specific (distinguishable from the speech sample played in the screen after the V-Tech logo when the console is started with no cartridge inserted), games purchased from an NTSC region would play on PAL systems and games purchased in PAL territories will also play on NTSC systems. Observations suggest that both the V.Smile and V.Smile Infant Development System used different methods of booting- The V.Smile and V.Smile Pocket variants will apparently boot into their own BIOS, then obligingly run the software on the cartridge. The V.Smile Baby appears to boot from the default BIOS when a cartridge of the same region is inserted or when there's no cartridge in the system, but appears to boot from a different BIOS when a cartridge of a different region is inserted. Currently it is unknown if the extra BIOS resides on the cartridge or on the console itself.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Pinball History</h2><h3>1800s -1900</h3><p style="">Pinball can trace its origins back to the 19th century game of Bagatelle, which became popular with American servicemen deployed in Europe.  The game was primitive, compared to modern machines with no electronics and little to no mechanical features. Players hit balls with a <a href="/pool-cue/3055-1900/" data-ref-id="3055-1900">cue stick</a> and attemped to nudge them into pockets or slots surrounded by nails or pins. Later in the 19th century inventor Montague Redgrave patented a device called a ball shooter which was similar to today pinball mechanism for releasing the ball, this which was based on the at the time recently invented steel <a href="/spring/3055-375/" data-ref-id="3055-375">spring</a>.</p><p style="">These machines were first popular in bars and cafes in <a href="/europe/3035-289/" data-ref-id="3035-289">Europe</a> and <a href="/the-united-states-of-america/3035-396/" data-ref-id="3035-396">America</a>, players first exchanged money for balls to play with, then if players obtained a high enough score, they would be awarded free drinks, meals and or <a href="/cigarette/3055-311/" data-ref-id="3055-311">cigarettes</a>. Soon after came the introduction of the first coin-operated Bagatelle pin machines.</p><h3>1930s - 1950s</h3><p style="">The first coin-operated pinball machine was introduced in 1931 by Automatic Industries and was called "Whiffle Board". Although the gaming industry really picked up in the mid 1930's with the production of a game called <a href="/ballyhoo/3030-6858/" data-ref-id="3030-6858">Ballyhoo</a>. It was invented by one Raymond Maloney, who later started the <a href="/bally-mfg-corp/3010-3045/" data-ref-id="3010-3045">Bally Manufacturing Company</a> of <a href="/chicago/3035-293/" data-ref-id="3035-293">Chicago</a>, IL.</p><p style="">The pinball machines of this era where mainly constructed of wood with wooden legs and wooden rails on the sides of the machine.</p><p style="">It is thought the term pinball came into play at this time due to the fact that all the machines at this time had holes and pins in them. In 1933, electricity was introduced to pinball machines by adding a battery to the machine and in 1934, the first automatic scoring mechanism would appear in the form of a "clock" counter, as well as the first sounds in a pinball machine by way of electro-mechanical chimes, bells and buzzers. The popularity of the pinball machine rose dramatically during the mid to late 1930's in part due to the depression era and the need for low-cost entertainment for the masses.</p><p style="">Since many pinball operators in the 1930's gave away prizes based on the <a href="/high-score/3015-260/" data-ref-id="3015-260">high scores</a> achieved, some players tried to cheat by shaking and lifting the game, so in 1935, the tilt mechanism was invented by Harry Williams, founder of the famous <a href="/williams-electronic-games-inc/3010-3243/" data-ref-id="3010-3243">Williams Manufacturing Company</a>, this mechanism determined how hard the table was tilted or shook to stop players trying to control the game to their advantage. Modern day pinball machines employ two such tilt devices, one that measures the movement of the game side to side, and another called the slam tilt that is used to movement up and down and prevents such acts as slamming your hand into the machine or trying to lift and drop the machine.</p><h3>1950s - 1990s</h3><p style="">Pinball machines grew in popularity after <a href="/world-war-ii/3015-471/" data-ref-id="3015-471">World War II</a>. The ten year period of 1948-58 is referred to by some as the Golden Age of pinball, due to the invention of flippers in 1947 by the <a href="/gottlieb/3010-524/" data-ref-id="3010-524">D. Gottlieb Co.</a> in a game called " <a href="/humpty-dumpty/3030-28674/" data-ref-id="3030-28674">Humpty Dumpty</a>", and was one of the main reasons for the renewed interest in pinballs at the time.</p><p style="">In 1948, a firm called Genco placed one set of flippers at the very bottom of the playfield in a machine called " <a href="/triple-action/3030-10262/" data-ref-id="3030-10262">Triple Action</a>" - But the setup was still a little unusual by today's standards; the flippers were facing outwards, not inwards like today's models.</p><p style="">The first game that had a modern flipper arrangement was the <a href="/spot-bowler/3030-28807/" data-ref-id="3030-28807">Spot Bowler</a>, a 1950's D. Gottlieb Co. machine. It was not until the mid 70's that most pinball machines adopted the longer 3 inch flippers we play with on today's modern machines.</p><p style="">It was also in the mid 70's that solid-state electronic pinball machines were first introduced, starting yet another huge wave of public popularity due to new games innovations, features, Game reliability and cool design features like electronic scoring, alphanumeric scoring, electronic sounds and finally electronic speech, which lasted well into the late 80's.</p><p style="">The late 80's saw <a href="/williams-electronic-games-inc/3010-3243/" data-ref-id="3010-3243">Williams</a> and <a href="/bally-mfg-corp/3010-3045/" data-ref-id="3010-3045">Bally</a> merge to become the main pinball manufacturers in the market, and in the 90's they both produced some of the most amazing pinball machines concepts ever dreamed of like <a href="/medieval-madness/3030-24687/" data-ref-id="3030-24687">Medieval Madness</a>, <a href="/cirqus-voltaire/3030-22732/" data-ref-id="3030-22732">Cirqus Voltaire</a>, <a href="/twilight-zone/3030-22731/" data-ref-id="3030-22731">Twilight Zone</a>, <a href="/theatre-of-magic/3030-27346/" data-ref-id="3030-27346">Theatre Of Magic</a>, <a href="/monster-bash/3030-14374/" data-ref-id="3030-14374">Monster Bash</a>, <a href="/scared-stiff/3030-35196/" data-ref-id="3030-35196">Scared Stiff</a>, <a href="/tales-of-the-arabian-nights/3030-35197/" data-ref-id="3030-35197">Tales Of The Arabian Nights</a> and the most popular pinball machine in modern history, <a href="/the-addams-family/3030-22525/" data-ref-id="3030-22525">Addams Family</a> (with over 20,000 produced), along with many other modern-day collectible classics, and finally the last pinball machines of the golden era of pinball manufacturers, <a href="/cactus-canyon/3030-35182/" data-ref-id="3030-35182">Cactus Canyon</a> and the <a href="/pinball-2000/3030-17913/" data-ref-id="3030-17913">Pinball 2000</a> machines, which combined video movies over standard pinball action.</p><p style="">After hitting peak popularity in the early 1990s, interest in pinball began to decline, with Capcom and Gottlieb shuttering their doors in the mid- to late 1990s, and ultimately with the shuttering of the pinball division at Bally/Williams.</p><p style=""> </p><h3>Currently</h3><p style="">Pinball has experienced yet another resurgence in popularity, with a strong collectors' market, as well as new venues for pinball opening up across the United States and the rest of the world.  Competitive pinball has also enjoyed a resurgence, with over 100 leagues regularly meeting across the world, and membership rising from just 500 active players worldwide in 2006 to over 27,000 active players worldwide in late 2014.</p><p style="">There are currently several companies currently producing commercial pinball machines.</p><p style="">Stern Pinball, Inc. (formerly <a href="/stern-electronics-inc/3010-2694/" data-ref-id="3010-2694">Stern Electronics, Inc.</a>) weathered the crash of the late 1990s and early 2000s, for a time existing as the only producer of pinball machines. Stern primarily focuses upon licensed properties, including The Walking Dead, AC/DC, Metallica, Lord of the Rings, Spider-Man, and Star Trek.  Their machines are generally offered in several versions, from pared-down pro versions designed for location play, to premium and LE editions aimed at the collector market. </p><p style=""><a href="/jersey-jack-pinball/3010-8065/" data-ref-id="3010-8065">Jersey Jack Pinball</a> entered the market in 2011, and released their first machine, <a href="/the-wizard-of-oz/3030-38749/" data-ref-id="3030-38749">The Wizard of Oz</a>, in 2013.  The company is currently working on The Hobbit to coincide with the release of the third film, and an as-of-yet unnamed Pat Lawlor project.</p><p style="">Dutch Pinball is currently building an upgrade kit to the Williams System 11 classic Bride of Pinbot, which will overhaul the game with new rules that provide diversified strategy, new music and speech, and a dot-matrix display.  The are also producing The Big Lebowski Pinball, currently in prototype, utilizing licensing from Universal and Brunswick.</p><p style="">Heighway Pinball, based in the UK, is releasing Full Throttle, which features an interactive display built into the playfield.</p><p style="">Riot Pinball is in the prototype phase of Wrath of Olympus.</p><p style="">Spooky Pinball has released their first pinball, America's Most Haunted, and will be manufacturing Wrath of Olympus.</p><p style="">Planetary Pinball, through a manufacturing contract with Stern, is in production on a remake of the classic Williams pinball, Medieval Madness, with remakes of Attack from Mars and Monster Bash on the horizon.</p><p style="">Whizbang Pinball has entered into an agreement with Stern to manufacture their first game Whoa Nellie! Big Juicy Melons!</p><p style="">Quetzal Pinball has just released their first game, Captain Nemo.</p><p style="">Multimorphic is currently prototyping several new games based upon their modular platform.</p><p style="">Skit-B pinball is releasing Predator, with Alien rumored to follow.</p><p style="">Zidware is currently designing two games, Magic Girl, and Retro Atomic Zombie Adventureland.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Arcade is simply defined as a place where people can hang out and have fun. However, over time, the word is mostly recognized today as a place to play video games and have fun. This was mainly because designer cabinets with screens inside them would provide games that people can enjoy. They would become known as Video Game Arcade machines.</p><p style="">Throughout the late 20th century, arcade machines were known for having the most cutting-edge technology in gaming, with superior graphics and audio capabilities than both home consoles and <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">personal computers</a>, as well as controls and peripherals not possible (or very expensive) on home machines. By the early 21st century, however, arcades had been surpassed by the <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC </a>platform in terms of graphics, and by home consoles in terms of popularity. Despite its decline, arcades still have the largest video game library of any platform, with more than 25,000 video game releases according to the <a href="http://www.mamedb.com/list.php" rel="nofollow">MAMEdb</a> online database.</p><h2>Origins</h2><p style="">While electro-mechanical arcade games, particularly <a href="/games/?sort=release_date&amp;filter_type=genre&amp;filter_value=35/">light-gun shooters</a> such as <a href="/sega/3010-62/" data-ref-id="3010-62">Sega</a>'s <a href="/duck-hunt/3030-36562/" data-ref-id="3030-36562">Duck Hunt</a>, had existed before, the arcade video game industry began in 1971, with <a href="/computer-space/3030-20713/" data-ref-id="3030-20713">Computer Space</a> in August and <a href="/galaxy-game/3030-24276/" data-ref-id="3030-24276">Galaxy Game</a> in September (for $20,000 at the time, equivalent to over $100,000 today); both games, based on <a href="/spacewar/3030-21514/" data-ref-id="3030-21514">Spacewar</a>, were unsuccessful. The first successful video game was <a href="/atari/3010-182/" data-ref-id="3010-182">Atari</a>'s <a href="/pong/3030-22195/" data-ref-id="3030-22195">Pong</a>, which originally retailed for $700 in 1972 (equivalent to about $4000 in 2012 dollars).</p><h2>Golden Age</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8153/924817-cpac_man.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-924817" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="1.6145833333333" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:161.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8153/924817-cpac_man.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-924817"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8153/924817-cpac_man.jpg"></a><figcaption>Pac-Man would become a huge hit for Arcade Games.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Video game arcade machines would later start to gain mainstream popularity from the late 1970s and peak during the early 1980s. This period is known as the Golden Age of Arcade Games and began in 1978 with the release of <a href="/space-invaders/3030-5099/" data-ref-id="3030-5099">Space Invaders</a>, which became the first blockbuster video game. It put an end to the 1977 video game market crash, caused a national coin shortage in <a href="/japan/3035-37/" data-ref-id="3035-37">Japan</a>, became a huge success worldwide, and laid the foundations for most <a href="/games/?sort=release_date&amp;filter_type=genre&amp;filter_value=11/">shooters</a> and <a href="/games/?sort=release_date&amp;filter_type=genre&amp;filter_value=1/">action</a> games released since then.</p><p style="">The next blockbuster video game was <a href="/pac-man/3030-7624/" data-ref-id="3030-7624">Pac-Man</a> in 1980. It would become a huge success, causing the developers to create a sequel <a href="/ms-pac-man/3030-6332/" data-ref-id="3030-6332">Ms. Pac-Man</a>. Both Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man would become so huge that people of all ages and genders filled the arcades playing the game, from children who played after school or the weekends, to adults who played during their lunch breaks, and after work.</p><p style="">Pac-Man and Space Invaders each grossed billions of dollars worldwide and remain the highest-grossing video games of all time. These games, along with some others, such as <a href="/galaxian/3030-2445/" data-ref-id="3030-2445">Galaxian</a>, <a href="/asteroids/3025-40/" data-ref-id="3025-40">Asteroids</a>, <a href="/galaga/3030-15784/" data-ref-id="3030-15784">Galaga</a>, <a href="/defender/3030-5536/" data-ref-id="3030-5536">Defender</a>, <a href="/frogger/3030-11903/" data-ref-id="3030-11903">Frogger</a>, <a href="/missile-command/3030-4062/" data-ref-id="3030-4062">Missile Command</a>, and <a href="/donkey-kong/3030-311/" data-ref-id="3030-311">Donkey Kong</a>, kept the arcade scene booming in the early 1980s.</p><p style="">Arcade games had become a multi-billion dollar industry. In <a href="/north-america/3035-1664/" data-ref-id="3035-1664">North America</a>, arcade video games even grossed higher revenues than both Hollywood and pop music combined, a rare feat that the North American video game industry has never been able to replicate again ever since.</p><p style="">Some of the technological advances that occurred during the this era include RGB colour graphics (from <a href="/speed-race-twin/3030-36587/" data-ref-id="3030-36587">Speed Race Twin</a> to <a href="/deluxe-space-invaders/3030-41053/" data-ref-id="3030-41053">Space Invaders Deluxe</a> and Galaxian), <a href="/vertical-scrolling/3015-1899/" data-ref-id="3015-1899">vertical scrolling</a> (<a href="/speed-race/3030-36499/" data-ref-id="3030-36499">Speed Race</a> and <a href="/xevious/3030-1487/" data-ref-id="3030-1487">Xevious</a>) and <a href="/side-scrolling/3015-299/" data-ref-id="3015-299">side-scrolling</a> (from <a href="/bomber/3030-18737/" data-ref-id="3030-18737">Bomber</a> to <a href="/scramble/3030-14662/" data-ref-id="3030-14662">Scramble</a>), <a href="/isometric-viewpoint/3015-246/" data-ref-id="3015-246">isometric </a>projection (<a href="/zaxxon/3030-9547/" data-ref-id="3030-9547">Zaxxon</a>), <a href="/first-person-perspective/3015-330/" data-ref-id="3015-330">first-person</a> perspective (from <a href="/balloon-gun/3030-41531/" data-ref-id="3030-41531">Balloon Gun</a> and <a href="/wild-gunman/3030-4116/" data-ref-id="3030-4116">Wild Gunman</a> to <a href="/duck-hunt/3030-2758/" data-ref-id="3030-2758">Duck Hunt</a>), <a href="/third-person-perspective/3015-464/" data-ref-id="3015-464">third-person</a> perspective (from <a href="/fonz/3030-36495/" data-ref-id="3030-36495">Fonz</a> to <a href="/pole-position/3030-10087/" data-ref-id="3030-10087">Pole Position</a> and <a href="/buck-rogers-planet-of-zoom/3030-12285/" data-ref-id="3030-12285">Buck Rogers</a>), <a href="/vector-graphics/3015-465/" data-ref-id="3015-465">vector</a> graphics (from Asteroids to <a href="/space-fury/3030-354/" data-ref-id="3030-354">Space Fury</a>), <a href="/polygonal-3d/3015-1430/" data-ref-id="3015-1430">3D polygon</a> graphics (<a href="/i-robot/3030-21973/" data-ref-id="3030-21973">I, Robot</a>), <a href="/stereoscopic-3d/3015-1204/" data-ref-id="3015-1204">stereoscopic 3D</a> effect (<a href="/subroc-3d/3030-33776/" data-ref-id="3030-33776">SubRoc-3D</a>), <a href="/chiptune/3015-3745/" data-ref-id="3015-3745">chiptune</a> soundtrack (from <a href="/gun-fight/3030-32574/" data-ref-id="3030-32574">Gun Fight</a> and <a href="/space-invaders/3030-5099/" data-ref-id="3030-5099">Space Invaders</a> to <a href="/rally-x/3030-2238/" data-ref-id="3030-2238">Rally-X</a> and <a href="/super-locomotive/3030-36543/" data-ref-id="3030-36543">Super Locomotive</a>), and stereo sound (<a href="/turbo/3030-18177/" data-ref-id="3030-18177">Turbo</a>).</p><h2>Relative Decline and Resurgence</h2><p style="">From 1983 onwards, the arcade market began experiencing a decline (though not as severe as the console market crash). By the mid-1980s, the popularity of arcade games declined further with the release of <a href="/nintendo/3010-90/" data-ref-id="3010-90">Nintendo</a>'s sequel to arcade game <a href="/mario-bros/3030-19726/" data-ref-id="3030-19726">Mario Bros</a>, called <a href="/super-mario-bros/3030-15544/" data-ref-id="3030-15544">Super Mario Bros</a>, which became a phenomenon and would put home consoles on the map. The <a href="/nes/3045-21/" data-ref-id="3045-21">NES</a>'s rising popularity slowly began to rival the arcade's dominance over the gaming industry. After Super Mario Bros made a killing on Nintendo's own console, a special arcade version named <a href="/vs-super-mario-bros/3030-25222/" data-ref-id="3030-25222">VS: Super Mario Bros</a> appeared in the arcades. This version had levels that were different and more challenging than the console version. Since then, video game developers released innovative and fun video games in arcades that would create a lasting effect for over a decade in the United States.</p><p style="">In 1985, <a href="/yu-suzuki/3040-15149/" data-ref-id="3040-15149">Yu Suzuki</a> and his <a href="/sega-am2/3010-81/" data-ref-id="3010-81">Sega AM2</a> team revitalized the arcade industry with <a href="/hang-on/3030-11570/" data-ref-id="3030-11570">Hang-On</a>, which introduced features that could not be replicated on home systems: advanced graphics (<a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/25d/3015-660/" data-ref-id="3015-660">pseudo-3D</a>, "<a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/super-scaler/3015-8389/" data-ref-id="3015-8389">Super Scaler</a>" <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/sprite-scaling/3015-7122/" data-ref-id="3015-7122">sprite-scaling</a>), and more importantly, a motion-controlled <a href="http://www.1up.com/features/disappearance-suzuki-part-1?pager.offset=1" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">hydraulic motorbike cabinet</a>, introducing full-body <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/motion-control/3015-474/" data-ref-id="3015-474">motion control</a>.

Many of the best-selling home video games in the early 1990's were also often arcade ports.

Sports games using authentic sports licenses were also made and became quite popular. This, along with inflation, would result in prices for play going up. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, most arcade games cost a quarter per play. However, this soon changed to fifty cents, seventy-five cents, and some games were even a full dollar for first play. At the time people didn't mind because the arcade was also known as the place to see and enjoy the latest graphics, audio and controls in video gaming. Even though the console market made a solid foundation in the homes of millions of Americans, most of them knew that the graphics, audio and controls in their chosen console didn't match the superior ones found in the arcade cabinets. Despite ports of popular arcade games hitting consoles, gamers knew they were getting a watered down version of the original.</p><h2>The Downfall of Arcades in North America</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8153/924824-street_fighter_alpha_anthology_20060612044731274_000.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-924824" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.7" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:70.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8153/924824-street_fighter_alpha_anthology_20060612044731274_000.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-924824"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8153/924824-street_fighter_alpha_anthology_20060612044731274_000.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8153/924824-street_fighter_alpha_anthology_20060612044731274_000.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Street Fighter Alpha. Example of a 2D arcade game perfectly ported to 32-bit consoles.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The success of arcade games began to change for the worse in the late 1990's when <a href="/polygonal-3d/3015-1430/" data-ref-id="3015-1430">3D</a> and <a href="/compact-disc/3055-2133/" data-ref-id="3055-2133">CD</a>-based console gaming start becoming popular.

Because of their ability to produce 3D graphics, improved capability in <a href="/2d/3015-1427/" data-ref-id="3015-1427">2D</a> graphics, and the compact disc ability to carry a lot of data, developers were finally able to make good ports of their games to sell on consoles. Business is business, and the developers saw where they could make a lot more money porting near-flawless copies of their games to popular gaming consoles. Because of this, gamers no longer felt they needed to spend money in the arcades to play the latest eye candy, as they could simply go to the store or mall and buy a decent port of the full game for their console.</p><p style="">However, while 32-bit consoles could produce 2D graphics on par with arcades, the arcades still remained competitive in the mid-to-late 1990s by pushing the boundaries of 3D graphics considerably beyond what consoles or <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC</a>'s were capable of, particularly when it came to powerful arcade machines like <a href="/sega/3010-62/" data-ref-id="3010-62">Sega</a>'s <a href="/daytona-usa/3030-22135/" data-ref-id="3030-22135">Model 2</a> (released 1993) and <a href="/virtua-fighter-3/3030-19766/" data-ref-id="3030-19766">Model 3</a> (released 1996) or <a href="/namco/3010-7420/" data-ref-id="3010-7420">Namco</a>'s <a href="/ridge-racer/3025-396/" data-ref-id="3025-396">System 22</a> (released 1993) and <a href="http://www.system16.com/hardware.php?id=539" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">System 23</a> (released 1997).

Many Japanese children as well as adults all go to huge and loud arcade places, that usually have sit down machines. As a result, many major and minor developers are still able to make games and turn a profit releasing those games in Japan. Many of these arcade games usually get ported over to the United States and release on the consoles. As of today, many video game developers are now making arcade games using modern <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC</a> hardware (whereas before, console and PC hardware were often based on arcade machines), making sure the legacy lives on forever.</p><p style="">In recent years, the economic recession, along with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/18/business/worldbusiness/18iht-arcades.1.12985638.html?_r=0" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">competition</a> from the <a href="/wii/3045-36/" data-ref-id="3045-36">Wii</a> (which introduced arcade-like <a href="/motion-control/3015-474/" data-ref-id="3015-474">motion controls</a> to homes), has affected the Japanese arcade industry, which has been slowly declining after hitting its peak in the mid-2000's. However, consoles have also begun declining in Japan due to the rise of handhelds and mobile gaming (with Japan having the largest handheld and mobile gaming markets in the world).</p><p style="">Arcade machines are currently thriving in other emerging markets in <a href="/asia/3035-1663/" data-ref-id="3035-1663">Asia</a>, particularly in <a href="/south-korea/3035-2410/" data-ref-id="3035-2410">South Korea</a> and especially <a href="/china/3035-343/" data-ref-id="3035-343">China</a>, where arcades are widespread across the country; in China's case, this may be partly due to a ban on video game consoles by the Chinese government, which did not lift the console ban until 2013.</p><p style="">Due to the arcade's continued relevance in Asia, many technologies continued to be released for arcades before appearing on consoles.

The most common a style of arcade cabinet in North America is the standard upright cabinet. These cabinets tend to be large and heavy due to there inefficient use of space inside the machine and use of heavy materials such a MDF and metal. Upright cabinets are often six feet tall and take up no more than three feet in width. Normally someone would have to stand to operate the cabinet, or sit on a tall bar stool.The control options for upright arcade cabinets vary from game to game, but commonly contain joysticks, buttons, trackballs, and spinners.</p><p style="">Also common in North America is the counter-top cabinets. This are cabinets that sit on top of something, like a bar or table to raise them up to playing height. Counter-top cabinets are popular because they save needed floor space and are less intrusive than a full sized cabinet. Although any game or control scheme could be made to work on a counter-top cabinet, they are most popular with touch screen trivia games in bars or pubs.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/121177/1679149-37182835_7085aa95c7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1679149" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.666" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:66.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/121177/1679149-37182835_7085aa95c7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1679149"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/121177/1679149-37182835_7085aa95c7.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/121177/1679149-37182835_7085aa95c7.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Popular Cocktail Cabinet War Lords.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Cocktail Cabinets are low to the ground, table like cabinets.

      <deck><![CDATA[Originally called "Project X", the Nuon started out as a concept for a stand alone console but instead became a built in 3D enhancement technology in a handful of DVD players.  NUON technology fared abysmally and the platform only managed to get 8 titles.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">NUON was a failed attempt by <a data-ref-id="3010-2638" href="/toshiba-corporation/3010-2638/" slug="toshiba-corporation">Toshiba</a>, Motorola, Samsung, and Raite Optoelectronics to add gaming, internet, and enhanced navigation to certain DVD players. NUON technology was developed by <a data-ref-id="3010-4939" href="/vmi/3010-4939/" slug="vmi">VM Labs Inc</a>. as an attempt to turn passive digital video into an interactive experience. NUON DVD players were supposed to be the "all-in-one" digital media experience. Richard Miller, using experience gained developing <a data-ref-id="3010-182" href="/atari-inc/3010-182/" slug="atari-inc">Atari</a> <a data-ref-id="3045-28" href="/jaguar/3045-28/" slug="jaguar">Jaguar</a> hardware, created a powerful 128-bit processor to embed in DVD players. The NUON had the power to decode audio and video while providing and enhanced UI and trick-play modes. More importantly, it provided a platform for 3D digital interactive content straight from a DVD player. NUON technology was only added to a handful of DVD players and support for the platform was abysmal. VM Labs filed for bankruptcy in 2001, just one year after the release of the NUON. VM Labs sold the NUON technology to Genesis Microchip, where development ceased after July 2002.</p><h2>Hardware</h2><p style="">At the core of the NUON is the Aries 3 chip, which was based on a 128-bit, 4 way parallel VLIW processor architecture. It manages the CPU, decodes audio and video, and preforms all system management. A hardware block on the chip assisted with MPEG video decoding so the Aries 3 was free to process other instructions. The chip was very powerful for it's time.</p><p style="">Features of the Aries 3:</p><ul><li>MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 audio/video decoding</li><li>5.1 channel Dolby Digital audio decoding</li><li>Extended DVD trick modes</li><li>32-voice wave table synthesizer</li><li>MP3 audio decoding</li><li>Content Scrambling System descrambling module</li><li>Video Scaling</li><li>3D video gaming</li></ul><p style="">The first DVD player to use NUON technology was the Toshiba SD-2300. The technology in the few available NUON DVD players raised the price around $100 over comparable players. The choice to market games to the movie audience ultimately ended up being a mistake. Sales were very poor, and support was absolutely terrible. The first NUON enhanced DVD was the software/movie Bedazzled by Fox Home Video. Just about every other publisher waited on the technology and support never truly came to the device. With the <a data-ref-id="3045-19" href="/playstation-2/3045-19/" slug="playstation-2">PlayStation 2</a>'s release imminent as a game console that plays DVDs rather than a DVD player that plays games, the chances of success for the NUON had gone. The public opted for the game console that was cheaper and had much better support for games.</p><p style="">The NUON had a variety of controllers, one popular standard one being white in color with a D-pad with 4 buttons. The stealth gamepad is 3-pronged controller with a mini analog stick, a D-pad, and a trigger button. It is designed very similarly to the <a data-ref-id="3045-43" href="/nintendo-64/3045-43/" slug="nintendo-64">Nintendo 64</a>'s controller. A memory unit was planned for Q1 2002 release for the NUON in sizes ranging from 2MB to 4MB, but was canceled. Many games used passwords to make up for the lack of a released memory card.</p><h2>Software</h2><p style="">Only eight games were ever released for NUON. The graphics are comparable to early <a data-ref-id="3045-19" href="/playstation-2/3045-19/" slug="playstation-2">PlayStation 2</a> games, and are most notable in <a data-ref-id="3030-20761" href="/iron-soldier-3/3030-20761/" slug="iron-soldier-3">Iron Soldier 3</a>, a mech combat game. The best game is generally regarded to be <a data-ref-id="3030-25964" href="/tempest-3000/3030-25964/" slug="tempest-3000">Tempest 3000</a> (many sources consider it the only truly playable game) and it's valued at much more than the other NUON games. Games were controlled via a proprietary controller. Depending on the model, there could be one or two controller ports.</p><h2>Homebrew</h2><p style="">The NUON homebrew community was more active than the commercial community. In late 2001, VM Labs released a homebrew SDK so developers could put out their own homebrew NUON software, even as the platform died and faded into obscurity. Homebrew games are simply burned to CD-Rs</p><h3>List of models that can play NUON homebrew</h3><ul><li>Samsung DVD-N501</li><li>Samsung DVDN504</li><li>Samsung DVDN505</li><li>RCA DRC300N</li><li>RCA DRC480N</li></ul><p style=""><em>The RCA models cannot play commercial NUON games.</em></p><h3>List of NUON homebrew</h3><ul><li>Ambient Monsters</li><li>Atari / C64 Video Game Music Player</li><li>Atari 800 Emulator</li><li>Atari 2600 PacMan (Hacked version of Chomp)</li><li>BOMB</li><li>Breakout</li><li>Chomp (Sample game included with the second NUON SDK)</li><li>Decaying Orbit</li><li>Doom Shareware</li><li>Pac-Man - Tournament Edition (Hacked version of Chomp)</li><li>SameGame - Colors</li><li>SameGame - Shapes</li><li>Sheshell's Sea Adventure</li><li>Snake</li><li>Synth Demo</li><li>Yaroze Classics (Katapila, Invs and BreakDown)</li></ul><h2>Links</h2><p style=""><a href="http://www.nuon-dome.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nuon-dome.com/</a>, a site dedicated to the NUON.</p>]]></description>

It is used to release classic games for a number of platforms as well as games by developers looking to get a needed plunge into the video game industry (or for established developers to release projects not fit for a full game release). It is also used for distributing new Wii Channels such as the Check Mii Out Channel or the Nintendo Channel. The channel launched on November 19, 2006 (the same day of the Wii release).</p><h2>Nintendo Points</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/10175-wiipointscard.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-10175" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.62916666666667" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/10175-wiipointscard.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-10175"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/26/10175-wiipointscard.jpg"></a><figcaption>Wii Points Card</figcaption></figure><p style="">Games are purchased using the proprietary Nintendo Points system (formerly known as Wii Points, before the launch of <a href="/dsiware/3045-106/" data-ref-id="3045-106">DSiWare</a>, which also uses Nintendo Points) where 100 points are equal to $1.00 USD.

The user can select a title, a gifting option, and then a message.

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>PlayStation Network</h2><p style="">The PlayStation Network is the online platform that Sony uses for their <a href="/playstation-3/3045-35/" data-ref-id="3045-35">PlayStation 3</a>, <a href="/psp/3045-18/" data-ref-id="3045-18">PlayStation Portable</a> (PSP) and <a href="/playstation-vita/3045-129/" data-ref-id="3045-129">PlayStation Vita</a> (PSVITA) systems. There is no fee to become a user and use all of its features.</p><h2>PlayStation Store</h2><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/16/161545/2437379-6702282256-pssto.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2437379" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/16/161545/2437379-6702282256-pssto.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2437379"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/16/161545/2437379-6702282256-pssto.jpg"></a></figure><p style="">The main source of distribution of content on the PlayStation Network is through the PlayStation Store. The PlayStation Store provides different kinds of content, such as games, demos, trailers, themes, wallpapers, add-ons, music, television shows, and movies, either for free or for a fixed price. The PlayStation Store is updated every Tuesday with new content, and on special occasions like E3 it is updated off-schedule.</p><h3>Sony Entertainment Network Web Store</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/16/161545/2437387-4501474603-sony-.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2437387" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.55172413793103" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:55.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/16/161545/2437387-4501474603-sony-.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2437387"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/16/161545/2437387-4501474603-sony-.jpg"></a></figure><p style="">In January 2013, Sony launched the Sony Entertainment Network web store in the United States, allowing users to purchase games, movies, and television shows using their computers. Purchased content is simply added to the download list on the user's PlayStation 3 and/or PlayStation Vita. Sony has said that it will add automatic download functionality in the future.</p><h3>PlayStation Store for PC</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/38266/1800774-psn_store___media_go.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1800774" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.48554913294798" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:48.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/38266/1800774-psn_store___media_go.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1800774"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/38266/1800774-psn_store___media_go.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/38266/1800774-psn_store___media_go.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Media Go's Game Store</figcaption></figure><p style="">The Media Go management program has a storefront within it, but as the software is meant for PSPs and Sony-Ericsson phones, it cannot access PS3-only content. All PSP products can be accessed, purchased, downloaded, and transferred. Anything from the video store can either be pushed to PSP or viewed/kept on the PC. Digital Comics from a multitude of publishers are also available, but unlike videos, they cannot be viewed on a computer and must be transferred to the PSP.</p><h3>Payment Methods</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22127/1095704-psnportableid.png" data-ref-id="1300-1095704" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.22727272727273" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:22.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22127/1095704-psnportableid.png" data-ref-id="1300-1095704"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22127/1095704-psnportableid.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22127/1095704-psnportableid.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Your PSN account.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Unlike some other online platforms that use points as a means of currency, the PlayStation Store uses the same currency of the country in which the user resides. There are different kinds of payment methods accepted on the PlayStation Store. When you add funds onto your account, those funds are stored in your "Wallet". Different methods of adding funds include:</p><ol><li>Credit Card</li><li>Pre-Paid Card</li><li>PLAYSTATION Network Card</li></ol><p style="">It should be noted that as of Winter 2008 major retailers such as Walmart, Target, and GameStop carry the PlayStation Network Cards. The cards come in denominations of twenty and fifty dollars.</p><h3><b>PSP PlayStation Store</b></h3><p style="">The PlayStation Store was integrated with the PSP in October of 2008. As a part of the PSP update 5.00, PSP users are able to access the store right from their handhelds to download games and media right to their memory stick. This store is the same as the one available for PC. It is important for Sony's strategy to continue to push digital distribution with the PSN so that PSP games will be available day and date to download off the store. The PSP Go is dependent on this due to its lack of a UMD drive.</p><h2>Life with PlayStation</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/38266/1800776-lwp.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1800776" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.56340956340956" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/38266/1800776-lwp.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1800776"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/38266/1800776-lwp.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/38266/1800776-lwp.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">On June 26, 2008, Sony announced Life with PlayStation.

For game developers, Home is primarily used as a way to let fans interact with certain franchises via Home Spaces, areas dedicated to specific themes.</p><h2>PlayStation Plus</h2><p style="">On June 29th, 2010, Sony launched a premium subscription service called PlayStation Plus through Firmware Update 3.40.</p><p style="">Features include:</p><ul><li>Hour long downloadable demos of full versions of select retail games (which can be purchased afterwords while retaining player progression and trophies)</li><li>Select free PSN games, PSOne Classics, and <a href="/psp-minis/3015-3868/" data-ref-id="3015-3868">PSP Minis</a> updated monthly</li><li>Exclusive discounts</li><li>Exclusive Themes, Avatars, and Add-On Content</li><li>Early demos and beta tests</li><li>Subscription to Qore, a PlayStation focused video series</li><li>The option to have the PS3 turn on at a specified time, daily, to search for and automatically update</li><li>Cloud backup of saves (added in Firmware 3.60)</li></ul><p style="">All free content is determined by Sony, and only available for the month chosen.

      <deck><![CDATA[The LeapFrog Leapster is a stylus-based educational game device aimed at children under 10.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2>The LeapFrog Leapster Learning Game System is a handheld video game system released in 2003.  The Leapster is an educational system targeted at children 4-10 years old with games to teach phonics, spelling, math, art, music and animal facts.  It features a 160x160px color touch screen controlled by a stylus as well as a D-Pad and various buttons.  The device is by far the most popular educational console in history, with a library of over 40 games and an install base of over 4 million.  In 2008 the Leapster was succeeded by the Leapster 2.<br/><br/><h2>Hardware</h2>The Leapster was designed to be visually appealing, easy to use, and durable.  The device features multiple methods of control including a 2.25" touch screen, directional pad, and two buttons on the right side of the unit.  The screen is backlit and large enough to support most games adequately, although some drawing/art games may be cluttered.  The Leapster has no hardware graphics acceleration, so graphics are simple and two dimensional, but are appropriate for the intended age range. The device has a large, mono speaker in the bottom right corner of the device.  It runs off 4 AA batteries, and an optional rechargable battery pack was available called the L-Max Recharging System.  Only one model revision was made to the Leapster in it's 5 years as a portable console called the Leapster L-Max, released in 2004.  The L-Max had slightly smaller dimensions and could output video to a TV via a composite cable.  In 2005 a fully consolized Leapster unit was released called the Leapster TV.<br/><br/><h3>Technical Specifications</h3><br/><em>CPU </em>- ARCTangent 5.1 running at 96MHz.<br/><em>Memory </em>- 2MB onboard RAM, 256 bytes non-volatile.<br/><em>Media </em>- Cartridges of 4-16MB with between 2 and 512kb non-volatile storage.<br/><em>Graphics </em>- No hardware acceleration.<br/><em>Audio </em>- Proprietary hardware audio acceleration.<br/><em>Screen </em>- 160x160px color.<br/><br/><h2>Software</h2>Leapster cartridges are compatible with all three Leapster models and include a large range of children edutainment software.  Many licensed characters are present in Leapster games such as <a data-ref-id="3005-2336" href="/spongebob-squarepants/3005-2336/" slug="spongebob-squarepants">       SpongeBob Squarepants</a>, <a data-ref-id="3030-19533" href="/thomas-the-tank-engine-friends/3030-19533/" slug="thomas-the-tank-engine-friends">      Thomas the Tank Engine</a>, <a data-ref-id="3005-7216" href="/dora-the-explorer/3005-7216/" slug="dora-the-explorer">     Dora the Explorer</a>, <a data-ref-id="3005-7442" href="/nemo/3005-7442/" slug="nemo">    Nemo</a>, <a data-ref-id="3005-12408" href="/cinderella/3005-12408/" slug="cinderella">   Cinderella</a>, <a data-ref-id="3005-12406" href="/ariel/3005-12406/" slug="ariel">  Ariel</a>, and <a data-ref-id="3005-66" href="/batman/3005-66/" slug="batman"> Batman</a>.  LeapFrog also created their own character Tad who narrates a few games.  Two games are pre-loaded onto the device: Rabbit River, a sort of educational Frogger clone and Color Corral, a problem solving and coloring activity suite.  Over 40 additional titles are available.  All games on the LeapFrog are educational, developed and produced by LeapFrog, have multiple skill levels, and carried MSRPs of $24.99.  All games also feature a hint system so children don't get stuck for too long, which will bring up visual or audio clues.  If a child answers a question incorrectly too many times, Edison the firefly pops up and coaches the child to teach them the concept they do not understand.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p style="">Microvision was a hand-held gaming console that was released by the <a data-ref-id="3010-2141" href="/milton-bradley-co/3010-2141/" slug="milton-bradley-co">Milton Bradley</a> Company in 1979. It was the very first handheld console to have interchangable cartridges. The Microvision led to moderate success but due to a fairly small screen and limited support from gaming companies and very few games, the sale and production of the Microvision ended in 1981.<br/><br/>Designed by Jay Smith (who later designed <a data-ref-id="3045-76" href="/vectrex/3045-76/" slug="vectrex">Vectrex</a>). With a small library, no tie in to a home unit, and a screen resolution that provided little ability to produce meaningful graphics, Microvision soon became little more than a memory. Still, the Microvision was a pioneer, overcoming the limitations of the light-emitting-diode displays that were standard for hand-held games at the time. <br/> <br/>Microvision units and cartridges are now very rare. Those that are still in existence are susceptible to three main problems: screen rot, static <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatic_discharge" rel="nofollow"></a>damage, and keypad destruction.<br/><br/> </p><h3><b>Technical specifications</b></h3> <ul class="plain-list"> <li>CPU: Intel 8021/TI TMS1100 (on cartridge)</li> <li>Screen type and resolution: 16 x 16 pixel LCD</li> <li>Register width: 4 bit (TMS1100), 8 bit (8021)</li> <li>Processor speed: 100 kHz</li> <li>RAM: 32 nybbles (16 8-bit bytes, integrated into CPU)</li> <li>ROM: 2K</li> <li>Cartridge ROM: 2K masked (integrated into CPU; each game's CPU was different)</li> <li>Video Display Processor: Custom (made by Hughes)</li> <li>Sound: Piezo beeper</li> <li>Input: Twelve button keypad, one paddle</li> <li>Power requirements: One 9 volt battery (TMS1100 processors), Two 9 volt batteries (Intel 8021 process</li></ul>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/429/526431-disk_kun1986.png" data-ref-id="1300-526431" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.9010752688172" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:90.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/429/526431-disk_kun1986.png" data-ref-id="1300-526431"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/429/526431-disk_kun1986.png"></a><figcaption>Disk-kun, the add-on's mascot character</figcaption></figure><p style="">The Famicom Disk System was part of a line of add-on systems produced exclusively in <a href="/japan/3035-37/" data-ref-id="3035-37">Japan</a> for its version of the <a href="/nes/3045-21/" data-ref-id="3045-21">Nintendo Entertainment System</a> called the Famicom. Its claim to fame was that its games were released on a medium similar to floppy disks. The disks, having two sides, originally contained more space than what a Famicom cartridge was capable of holding. They were also much cheaper to produce, a characteristic meant to lure developers to the platform. The Famicom also features a microphone in the controller, which certain games used, such as an updated version of the original Zelda. Despite the Disk System's moderate success, the majority of the Famicom's library still remained in cartridge form exclusively. Nevertheless, several of Nintendo's series were started on the Famicom Disk System and later entries in the series were available on more mainstream Nintendo platforms.</p><h2>The Disk</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1751015-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1751015" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.196" data-width="250" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 250px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:119.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1751015-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1751015"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1751015-1.jpg"></a><figcaption>A yellow famicom disk system game</figcaption></figure><p style="">The Famicom Disk System's games contained internal features impossible to replicate on cartridges. The most notable of these features was their rewriting capability. Aside from being applied to conventional tasks, such as saving progress, certain disks could also have their games entirely overwritten for a small fee.</p><p style="">The disks themselves were either a yellow or blue color and have the word Nintendo etched in at the bottom, with the blue version containing a shutter, whereas the yellow does not. Most disks have stickers on both sides that contain the title of the game as well as a large "A" or "B" (alternatively "Side A" or "Side B") on the left side of the sticker which tells the player the side of the disk. Typically the player needs to put Side A in first to boot up the game and once they start a game or load a saved file a message will appear on the screen telling the player to switch sides. At this point the player needs to eject the disk and flip it over to side B to start the game. Some disks are one sided meaning side B is blank and doesn't have a sticker on it. Games that have a blank side B do not need to be flipped over at any point.</p><h2>Sharp Twin Famicom</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1757570-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1757570" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.46650717703349" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:46.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1757570-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1757570"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1757570-1.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1757570-1.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Twin Famicom</figcaption></figure><p style="">Sharp Corporation released the Twin Famicom in Japan on July 1, 1986, less than five months after the release of the Famicom Disk System. The Twin Famicom combines the Famicom and Famicom Disk System into one system and is officially licensed by Nintendo. The system has a switch just below the cartridge slot that allows the player to switch between using the Disk System or the Famicom. When switched to the Disk System the cartridge slot locks to prevent players from attempting to use both slots at the same time. Similarly, if switched to the Famicom the Disk System slot locks for the same reason.</p><p style="">The original release of the system came in two different colors red with black highlights or black with red highlights. There was also a re-release that came in a slightly different case design, turbo controllers, and two new sets of color schemes. The first color scheme is black with green highlights and the second is red with blue and gray highlights.</p><h2>Overseas Conversions</h2><p style="">Because Nintendo opted to not distribute the Famicom Disk System outside of Japan, all of its games which received international releases required technical modifications so that they could function on regular cartridges. Ultimately few of these games retained their ability to save games due to the costs of incorporating batteries into the cartridges. ( <a href="/the-legend-of-zelda/3030-11949/" data-ref-id="3030-11949">The Legend of Zelda</a> is one exception, as it still employed battery-backed saving.) Instead, many games, such as <a href="/metroid/3030-21761/" data-ref-id="3030-21761">Metroid</a>, employed <a href="/password/3015-38/" data-ref-id="3015-38">passwords</a> to record players' progress.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/429/526527-dokidoki1.png" data-ref-id="1300-526527" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.9375" data-width="256" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 256px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:93.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/429/526527-dokidoki1.png" data-ref-id="1300-526527"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/429/526527-dokidoki1.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/429/526527-dokidoki1.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>The original protagonists of Doki Doki Panic</figcaption></figure><p style="">The American version of <a href="/super-mario-bros-2/3030-7406/" data-ref-id="3030-7406">Super Mario Bros. 2</a>, however, is the most famous of these conversions. Because the <a href="/super-mario-bros-the-lost-levels/3030-20974/" data-ref-id="3030-20974">original sequel</a> in Japan was deemed to be too difficult for most players at the time, Nintendo chose to bring over what was originally a completely different game instead and retrofit it as a <a href="/mario/3005-177/" data-ref-id="3005-177">Mario</a> game. The game which was chosen to do this was <a href="/yume-kojo-doki-doki-panic/3030-21469/" data-ref-id="3030-21469">Doki Doki Panic</a>, an Arabian-themed platformer which had been produced for a television station's special event.

      <deck><![CDATA[Pioneer LaserActive was a failed modular laserdisc-based game console notable for its use of expansion modules as well as being the second highest priced console of all time.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">The Pioneer LaserActive was a high-end video player and game console released in 1993. It played LaserDiscs, LaserActive games, and had add-on support for <a href="/genesis/3045-6/" data-ref-id="3045-6">Genesis </a>and <a href="/turbografx-16/3045-55/" data-ref-id="3045-55">TurboGrafx-16 </a>games. The LaserActive was hyped to compete with the <a href="/3do/3045-26/" data-ref-id="3045-26">3DO </a>at the huge MSRP of $969.99. At CES in 1993, the 3DO was on display but the LaserActive was displayed at an invite-only event and hype died for the console a few months before its September release. Quite notable about LaserActive, besides the unsightly price tag, was the fact that the Genesis and TurboGrafx-16 add-ons were actually developed jointly with <a href="/sega/3010-62/" data-ref-id="3010-62">Sega </a>and <a href="/nec-technologies-inc/3010-1741/" data-ref-id="3010-1741">NEC</a>. In previous eras of gaming, similar pirated adapters would be released that were both unauthorized and illegal.</p><h2>Hardware</h2><p style="">The Pioneer CLD-A100 was the only LaserActive model (besides the <a href="/nec-technologies-inc/3010-1741/" data-ref-id="3010-1741">NEC </a>PDE-LD1, which was a clone). It played regular laserdiscs as well as LaserActive games which were 540Mb LD-ROM laserdiscs. It is the second most expensive console ever released, with an MSRP of $969.99 and expansions (called PACs) going for around $599.99 (The most expensive console ever was the <a href="/rdi-halcyon/3045-107/" data-ref-id="3045-107">RDI Halcyon </a>which retailed for $2,500). The console has a large, motorized tray in the front that accepts 12" laserdiscs as well as a smaller door for 5" CDs. The bottom of the unit has a large expansion slot for the <a href="/sega/3010-62/" data-ref-id="3010-62">Sega</a>, NEC, and Karaoke modules produced. Locking mechanisms were used to prevent a game from being ejected while in use. The system came with a remote, but no controller. The controllers were bundled with the PACs.</p><p style="">A LaserActive with both the Sega and NEC PACs can play around 1,500 games, but only a dozen or so laserdisc games were ever released exclusively for the console. LaserActive games were graphically and audibly superior to games that came out around the same time, but due to the format it lacked the precise controls of competing consoles. The discs held 540Mb worth of code for the game but the LaserActive software could store over 100,000 still images and an hour of audio in addition to that, making it hard to compete with audibly and visually.</p><p style="">The LaserActive weighs in at 25lbs and measures 6x17x15".</p><h3><a href="/3-d-glasses/3055-1919/" data-ref-id="3055-1919"> 3D Glasses</a></h3><p style="">3D glasses were available for the LaserActive called the LaserActive 3-D Goggles; <em>GOL-1. </em>A required adapter, the <em>ADP-1</em>, was necessary to use them. The adapter allowed two sets of glasses to be connected. Many LaserActive games supported the goggles. They are extraordinarily rare today.</p><h2>PACs</h2><p style="">The add on components were referred to as PACs by <a href="/pioneer-productions/3010-845/" data-ref-id="3010-845">Pioneer</a>. They were inserted into the single expansion slot in the lower part of the console and look similar to modern day optical disk or floppy disk drives. The base console itself could only play laserdisc movies, thus a PAC was required even to play Laseractive games. To make matters worse each Laseractive game could only be played on a specific PAC. If a consumer wanted to play all the games specifically built for the system but didn't care about either Genesis or Turbografix games than they still would of had to buy both. </p><h3>Sega PAC</h3><p style="">The Sega PAC, <em>PAC-S10</em>, allows the LaserActive to play 8" and 12" Mega LD discs, as well as existing <a href="/genesis/3045-6/" data-ref-id="3045-6">Genesis </a>and even <a href="/sega-cd/3045-29/" data-ref-id="3045-29">Sega CD </a>games. Mega LD discs were loaded with MPEG-1 FMV backgrounds used in conjunction with Genesis or Sega CD games. The 2d sprites from the Genesis games would be pasted on the motion background from the laserdisc. The PAC has 2 Genesis controller ports on the front and included a Pioneer branded 6-button Genesis controller. It also included a Mega LD called <a href="/pyramid-patrol/3030-20791/" data-ref-id="3030-20791">Pyramid Patrol</a>, and a Sega CD compilation disc featuring <a href="/streets-of-rage/3030-20436/" data-ref-id="3030-20436">Streets of Rage</a>, <a href="/the-revenge-of-shinobi/3030-236/" data-ref-id="3030-236">Revenge of Shinobi</a>, <a href="/columns/3030-5487/" data-ref-id="3030-5487">Columns </a>and <a href="/golden-axe/3030-14351/" data-ref-id="3030-14351">Golden Axe</a>. The Sega PAC was so popular that more than half of US LaserActive owners purchased this add-on for $599.99. About 20 LD-ROM games were released for the Sega PAC.</p><h3>NEC PAC</h3><p style="">The NEC PAC, PAC-N10, allowed the LaserActive to play HuCards, Super CD-ROMs, and LD-ROM^2 discs. It came with a 2 button controller and an LD-ROM^2 that included the same games that came with a NEC TurboDuo (<a href="/gate-of-thunder/3030-20937/" data-ref-id="3030-20937">Gate of Thunder</a>, <a href="/bonks-adventure/3030-6973/" data-ref-id="3030-6973">Bonk's Adventure</a>, <a href="/bonks-revenge/3030-8670/" data-ref-id="3030-8670">Bonk's Revenge </a>and <a href="/bomberman/3030-2430/" data-ref-id="3030-2430">Bomberman</a>). It also came with an educational game named Econosaurus that used the LD-ROM^2 format. The device is region locked, so it will not play PC-Engine games on a US console. It retailed for $599.99, the same price as the Sega PAC, but was much more poorly received. It is widely sought after due to its rarity.</p><p style="">Nine games were released on LD-ROM^2 for the NEC PAC.</p><h3>Karaoke PAC</h3><p style="">The Karaoke PAC, PAC-K10, was a novel concept for gaming consoles at the time. It allowed the system to play all LaserKaraoke titles and sing along to music videos. The PAC included a microphone and features 2 mic inputs with separate volume controls, and a tone control. It was compatible with about 200 karaoke titles and, like the other PACs, was region locked. It retailed for $349.99.</p><h3>Computer Interface PAC</h3><p style="">The Computer Interface PAC, PAC-C1<em>, </em>allows remote control of the LaserActive via a 25-pin serial port where it can be hooked up to a PC or Mac. It came with a 33-button remote to replace the included 24-button one. The PAC included software to create LaserActive software called LaserActive Program Editor<em>. </em>On the bundled floppies were example programs that interacted with <a href="/tenchi-muyo/3025-1385/" data-ref-id="3025-1385">Tenchi-Muyo! </a>laserdiscs.</p><h2>Market Failure</h2><p style="">The LaserActive is a very innovative device; not many consoles are able to play as wide a variety of games as it can. It failed due to an outrageous price as well as very poor marketing and managed to sell merely 10,000 units. At the Consumer Electronics Show in 1993, Pioneer inexplicably showcased the hardware behind closed doors. The reasons for this were unknown and the <a href="/3do/3045-26/" data-ref-id="3045-26">3DO </a>took center stage. When the console was released in September 1993, not enough consumers had heard about it or cared about it. The price tag was almost impossible to justify at $969.99, and PACs costing $599.99. A Sega Genesis was $229.99 at the time and a Sega CD $89.99. That's about half the price of what the Sega PAC cost, in addition to nearly $1000 for the LaserActive itself. Most gamers ignored the NEC add-on due to the lack of notable software releases.</p><p style="">In addition to the fact that the PACs cost more than their respective console equivalents, the LaserActive wasn't an extraordinary laserdisc player for the high end AV market. It did not have a jog dial or a digital display. The software library of Mega-LD and LD-ROM^2 titles is too small to even mention. The system launched to an audience that didn't receive it and died out to the 3DO in 1994.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Released in late 1982 by Entex, the <a data-ref-id="3045-93" href="/adventure-vision/3045-93/">Adventure Vision</a> is actually a handheld console though it is way too big to be used as a proper handheld device. The console is self-contained, and thus no external monitor is needed, and uses game cartridges. As far as the monitor goes, it uses one string of 40 red LEDs and a spinning mirror (just like <a data-ref-id="3010-90" href="/nintendo/3010-90/">Nintendo</a>'s <a data-ref-id="3045-79" href="/virtual-boy/3045-79/">Virtual Boy</a>) instead of an LCD screen, which leads to a resolution of 150 x 40 pixels and an amount of 15 frames per second. That kind of monitor was a huge drawback, as no other console at the time used that techique. Not to mention that the mirror drew a large amount of power from the batteries, although the AC adapter that is built in solves that.</p><p style="">Due to the monitor, only 4 games were released for it.</p><h2>Technical Specifications</h2><ul><li><b>CPU</b>: Intel 8048 running @ 733 KHz</li><li><b>Sound:</b> National Semiconductor COP411L @ 52.6 KHz</li><li><b>RAM:</b> 64 bytes (8048-internal), and 1K (on main PCB)</li><li><b>ROM:</b> 1K (8048-internal), 512 bytes (COP411L-internal) and 4K (game cartridge)</li><li><b>Input:</b> 4 direction joystick</li><li><b>Graphics</b>: 150x40 monochrome pixels, running @ 15 FPS</li></ul>]]></description>

Chances are, you're probably reading this wiki on a PC right now.

The first binary computer was the Z1 Computer, created by the German inventor Konrad Zuse. Other electronic computers would be created throughout the time period, including the ENIAC and the Harvard Mark I. Many of the first computers were used during <a href="/world-war-ii/3015-471/" data-ref-id="3015-471">World War II</a> by both factions and would be later used for scientific research. Early computers were large enough to fill a room, making them unusable for practical, personal use. Later it would be used by banks and large businesses for economic calculations. Companies like <a href="/ibm/3010-190/" data-ref-id="3010-190">IBM</a> have supplied many businesses with computers years before the personal computer .</p><h3>1970s</h3><p style="">It wasn't until the 1970s where computers usable for the average person were being made. Invented in 1970 by John V. Blakenbaker of the Kenbak Corporation, the Kenbak-1 is considered by the <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/timeline/?year=1971" rel="nofollow">Computer History Museum</a> to be the world's "first personal computer". Starting in 1971, it was sold for $750 and only 40 machines were ever built and sold. In 1973, Kenbak folded and stopped production. However, it was based on TTL (transistor-transistor-logic) discrete circuitry (much like the <a href="/odyssey/3045-74/" data-ref-id="3045-74">Magnavox Odyssey</a> and <a href="/pong/3030-22195/" data-ref-id="3030-22195">Pong</a>) rather than microprocessor technology. As such, it wasn't until the late 1970s that the first "true" personal computers began appearing.</p><p style="">Several revolutionary inventions would later pave the way to the modern personal computer, most importantly the microprocessor. The project originated in 1969, when <a href="/japan/3035-37/" data-ref-id="3035-37">Japanese</a> <a href="/calculator/3055-2985/" data-ref-id="3055-2985">calculator </a>manufacturer Busicom proposed the idea to <a href="/the-united-states-of-america/3035-396/" data-ref-id="3035-396">American</a> manufacturer Intel, and both soon collaborated to produce the first microprocessor. By 1971, Intel's engineers Bob Noyce and Gordon Moore, and Busicom's engineer Masatoshi Shima, succeeded in creating the world's first microprocessor, the 4-bit Intel 4004. The microprocessor helped in creating a more powerful central processing unit than the ones used in computers at the time and shrunk it so computers could be smaller. The microprocessor was the major invention that gave birth to the microcomputer, or the personal computer as it is known today.</p><p style="">The first microprocessor-based personal computer, i.e. the first microcomputer, was the SMP80/X, released by Sord (now <a href="/toshiba-corporation/3010-2638/" data-ref-id="3010-2638">Toshiba Personal Computer System Corporation</a>) in 1974, utilizing the 8-bit Intel 8080 processor (its unreleased 1972 predecessor, the SMP80/08, used the first general-purpose microprocessor, the 8-bit Intel 8008). It was soon followed in 1975 by the Altair 8800, which also used the Intel 8080 as its CPU; since the computer's main language was binary code and only had an output of flashing lights, the computer was unusable by the common person. A similar microcomputer was released by <a href="/nec-home-electronics-ltd/3010-2708/" data-ref-id="3010-2708">NEC </a>in 1976, the TK-80, which used the Intel 8080A.</p><p style="">It wasn't until 1977 when two <a href="/california/3035-1719/" data-ref-id="3035-1719">California </a>college students, <a href="/steve-jobs/3040-9951/" data-ref-id="3040-9951">Steve Jobs</a> and <a href="/steve-wozniak/3040-93519/" data-ref-id="3040-93519">Steve Wozniak</a>, created the first personal computer with a monitor, the Apple I. Thanks to the monitor, programming became much easier and programmers could see exactly what they were doing. Also, it helped the average user see the programs people created. This sparked a new revolution in the computer industry, bringing the creation of <a href="/apple-inc/3010-5815/" data-ref-id="3010-5815">Apple Computers</a> and starting the personal computer market. Other competing desktop computers with CRT display monitors soon followed in the late 1970s, including the M200 by Sord (now <a href="/toshiba-corporation/3010-2638/" data-ref-id="3010-2638">Toshiba Personal Computer System Corporation</a>) in 1977, Hitachi's Basic Master in 1978, and <a href="/acornsoft/3010-4956/" data-ref-id="3010-4956">Acorn</a>'s System 1 in 1979.</p><h3>1980s</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1650295-alienware_malx_back.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1650295" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.0761904761905" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:107.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1650295-alienware_malx_back.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1650295"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3661/1650295-alienware_malx_back.jpg"></a><figcaption>Powerful laptops have made PC gaming mobile.</figcaption></figure><p style="">After the release of the <a href="/apple-ii/3045-12/" data-ref-id="3045-12">Apple II</a>, many competitors formed in the early 1980s, including the <a href="/ibm/3010-190/" data-ref-id="3010-190">IBM</a> Personal Computer, which would later dominate the market in the 1990s.

Due to the gaming crash of 1983, many computer manufacturers focused on the business aspects of these machines, leaving gaming as an afterthought.</p><p style="">However, there were many computers that were well-known for their gaming libraries. The leading 8-bit gaming computer platforms in the 1980s included the <a href="/apple-ii/3045-12/" data-ref-id="3045-12">Apple II</a> in North America, the <a href="/commodore-64/3045-14/" data-ref-id="3045-14">Commodore 64</a> and Atari 400/800 in the West, the <a href="/zx-spectrum/3045-16/" data-ref-id="3045-16">ZX Spectrum</a> and <a href="/bbc-micro/3045-110/" data-ref-id="3045-110">BBC Micro</a> in the <a href="/united-kingdom/3035-492/" data-ref-id="3035-492">UK</a>, the <a href="/msx/3045-15/" data-ref-id="3045-15">MSX </a>in <a href="/japan/3035-37/" data-ref-id="3035-37">Japan </a>and <a href="/europe/3035-289/" data-ref-id="3035-289">Europe</a>, the high-resolution <a href="/nec-pc-8801/3045-109/" data-ref-id="3045-109">NEC PC-88</a> in <a href="/japan/3035-37/" data-ref-id="3035-37">Japan</a>, and the high-colour <a href="/fm-7/3045-114/" data-ref-id="3045-114">FM-7</a> and <a href="/sharp-x1/3045-113/" data-ref-id="3045-113">Sharp X1</a> in Japan.

Now it was easier for people to see what they were doing with computers thanks to computers like the <a href="/mac/3045-17/" data-ref-id="3045-17">Macintosh</a> and the DOS extension Windows. The GUI was first created by Xerox in the 1960s, but the company was not interested in entering the computer market. Apple was given the rights to use GUI for the Macintosh, however, Microsoft was able to trick Apple into lending them prototype Macintosh computers to create programs for the new machines. They used the coding of the operating system to create Windows, an extension to DOS. Thanks to the cheap $100 price point and its compatibility with all DOS computers, Windows became a success, becoming the new standard of computers by the mid-1990s.</p><p style="">The 1980s also saw the emergence of portable laptop computers. The world's first laptop computer was the Epson HX-20 in 1981. The first commercially successful laptop was Kyocera's Kyotronic 85, originally released in 1983 and re-branded by <a href="/tandy-corporation/3010-1602/" data-ref-id="3010-1602">Tandy</a> as the <a href="/trs-80/3045-63/" data-ref-id="3045-63">TRS-80</a> Model 100, selling 6 million units worldwide. Other competitors soon followed, including <a href="/sharp-corporation/3010-6509/" data-ref-id="3010-6509">Sharp</a>'s PC-5000 which had a <a href="/touch-controls/3015-2256/" data-ref-id="3015-2256">touchpad</a> pointing device in 1983, and <a href="/commodore/3010-2000/" data-ref-id="3010-2000">Commodore</a>'s SX 64 in 1984. The first mass-market laptop was <a href="/toshiba-corporation/3010-2638/" data-ref-id="3010-2638">Toshiba</a>'s 16-bit T-1100 in 1985, which they followed with the T-3100 (the first with a built-in hard drive) in 1986. Other competitors soon followed, including <a href="/nec-home-electronics-ltd/3010-2708/" data-ref-id="3010-2708">NEC</a>'s <a href="/nec-pc-9801/3045-112/" data-ref-id="3045-112">PC-98 </a>LT and <a href="/ibm/3010-190/" data-ref-id="3010-190">IBM</a>'s PC Convertible in 1986 and <a href="/apple-inc/3010-5815/" data-ref-id="3010-5815">Apple</a>'s <a href="/mac/3045-17/" data-ref-id="3045-17">Macintosh</a> Portable in 1989. The first notebook computer was released in 1989, NEC's UltraLite, which they followed with the first colour TFT LCD laptop in 1990, the 32-bit <a href="/nec-pc-9801/3045-112/" data-ref-id="3045-112">PC-9801</a> NC. Apple soon followed with the PowerBook series from 1991 onwards, further popularizing laptop computers in the 1990s.</p><h3>1990s</h3><p style="">In the 1990s, the Internet was released to the public after originally being used to connect college computers and military computers to different networks. Since the Internet was introduced to the public, it became a major part of modern society. Now the average computer user is able to access files from many different servers, and have the ability to communicate with people from around the world. This new technology was a revolution in gaming, with <a href="/online/3015-559/" data-ref-id="3015-559">online</a> gaming becoming a standard on the PC by the mid 1990s.</p><p style="">Another important revolution for PC gaming was the introduction of <a href="/polygonal-3d/3015-1430/" data-ref-id="3015-1430">3D graphics</a> accelerator cards in the late 1990s, which allowed the PC to take the lead in cutting-edge 3D graphics technology by the 21st century. The first 3D graphics card for a home computer was <a href="/nec-home-electronics-ltd/3010-2708/" data-ref-id="3010-2708">NEC</a>'s PC-FXGA, released for their <a href="/nec-pc-9801/3045-112/" data-ref-id="3045-112">PC-98</a> platform in 1995, which could produce 3D graphics surpassing the <a href="/playstation/3045-22/" data-ref-id="3045-22">PlayStation </a>console and rivaling the <a href="/nintendo-64/3045-43/" data-ref-id="3045-43">Nintendo 64</a> in terms of polygon rendering performance. The first 3D graphics cards for IBM-compatible PC's soon followed in early 1996: Creative Labs' 3D Blaster, <a href="/nvidia-corporation/3010-6345/" data-ref-id="3010-6345">NVIDIA</a>'s NV1, and particularly <a href="/nec-home-electronics-ltd/3010-2708/" data-ref-id="3010-2708">NEC</a>'s PowerVR. While the 3D Blaster and NV1 (with the first game to support them being PlayStation port <a href="/battle-arena-toshinden/3030-5238/" data-ref-id="3030-5238">Toshinden</a>) were unable to rival the PlayStation, the PowerVR surpassed the PlayStation and even approached <a href="/arcade/3045-84/" data-ref-id="3045-84">arcade</a> quality graphics, with a near arcade quality PowerVR demo of <a href="/namco/3010-7420/" data-ref-id="3010-7420">Namco</a>'s <a href="/rave-racer/3030-23244/" data-ref-id="3030-23244">Rave Racer</a> (though this PC port was later cancelled). Similarly, the NV1 card received PC ports of <a href="/sega/3010-62/" data-ref-id="3010-62">Sega</a> titles <a href="/virtua-fighter-remix/3030-17431/" data-ref-id="3030-17431">Virtua Fighter Remix</a> and <a href="/virtua-cop/3030-10543/" data-ref-id="3030-10543">Virtua Cop</a> (which surpassed the <a href="/saturn/3045-42/" data-ref-id="3045-42">Saturn</a> versions, but couldn't rival the arcade originals). In late 1996, 3dfx launched the Voodoo line, which rivalled the PowerVR in quality and would soon become the most popular PC graphics cards of the late 1990s. <a href="/fujitsu/3010-6596/" data-ref-id="3010-6596">Fujitsu</a> soon introduced the FXG-1 "Pinolite" geometry processor, the first GPU with T&amp;L (Transform &amp; Lighting) hardware capabilities, in 1997, paving the way for NVIDIA's GeForce and ATI's Radeon, both of which would later dominate the PC graphics card market in the 21st century.</p><h3>21st century</h3><p style="">Today, more than a billion people around the world use the PC platform, with the majority of them being connected to the internet. A majority of PC gamers today are located in <a href="/asia/3035-1663/" data-ref-id="3035-1663">Asia</a>, with <a href="/china/3035-343/" data-ref-id="3035-343">China </a>alone accounting for nearly a third of the worldwide PC gaming market, the growth of which has largely been fueled by the rise of <a href="/online/3015-559/" data-ref-id="3015-559">online</a> gaming.</p><h2>Operating Systems</h2><p style="">Before operating systems, one had to learn complex coding in order to get something to work.

With Windows, people could easily browse through their files and do other simple functions much more quickly. Windows has grown in popularity and became the most popular OS in the world, having the support of PC makers like <a href="/dell-inc/3010-4850/" data-ref-id="3010-4850">Dell</a>, Gateway, and HP. Windows has gone through many iterations, starting with the MS-DOS days having Windows versions 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.1, and 3.11. Then came Windows NT 3.0-4.0 and Windows 2000 (oriented toward business) and the Windows 9x operating systems including Windows 95, 98, and ME (oriented toward home users). The 9x line was dropped and later versions of Windows have been based on NT, continuing the line from 2000 through XP, Vista, Windows 7, and now Windows 8.</p><p style="">The preferred platform for modern PC games is a Windows PC running either Windows XP, Vista, 7, or 8(.1). Windows XP does not support <a href="/directx/3015-5193/" data-ref-id="3015-5193">DirectX</a> 10 but does not suffer from incompatibilities with older games like Vista, 7, or 8 may. Vista and 7 have the advantage of DirectX 10 or 11 while Windows 8.1 can support up to DirectX 11.2, and some exclusive games tied to the OS such as <a href="/halo-2/3030-7110/" data-ref-id="3030-7110">Halo 2</a>. Because of the negative feedback that came from Vista, game developers were reluctant to make DirectX 10 only games. Thanks to the success of Windows 7, more DirectX 10/11 only games are being made, most notably <a href="/shattered-horizon/3030-23436/" data-ref-id="3030-23436">Shattered Horizon</a>, <a href="/just-cause-2/3030-20742/" data-ref-id="3030-20742">Just Cause 2</a>, and <a href="/battlefield-3/3030-27006/" data-ref-id="3030-27006">Battlefield 3</a>.</p><p style="">Windows 7 provides gamers with a games browser that notifies the user of patches and updates for some games as they become available. Windows 7 is generally faster than Vista and fixes many of the issues people had with that OS such as intrusive Security settings and sluggish performance, Windows 7 also comes with DirectX 11. <a href="/dirt-2/3030-24513/" data-ref-id="3030-24513">Dirt2</a> was among the first games to support this.</p><p style="">On October 25, 2012, Microsoft released Windows 8 to the public. This new operating system introduces the "Metro" interface, which makes menus more easily accessible to people who are using tablets and touch controls. Windows 8 also introduces its own app store which will allow developers to publish and distribute their Metro applications and games. <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/xbox-live/3015-1404/" data-ref-id="3015-1404">Xbox Live</a> is integrated with the OS which can be used as a user account for the computer and can earn <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/achievements/3015-29/" data-ref-id="3015-29">achievement points</a> on games downloaded from the app store. There have been complaints about the new OS because of its lackluster desktop interface and the removal of the standard Start menu in favor of the Metro interface, but Windows 8.1 addressed some of these issues with the return of the Start menu and the ability to use windowed Metro apps.</p><p style="">On July 29, 2015, Microsoft released Windows 10 to the public. It's a free update for all Windows 7 and 8 users for the first year of release, making it the first Windows OS that is available for free. One of the major features of Windows 10 is it's cross compatibility with tablets and smartphones as well as desktop and laptop PCs, as well as being implemented for <a href="/xbox-one/3045-145/" data-ref-id="3045-145">Xbox One</a> consoles in the future. It also features a new voice companion called <a href="/cortana/3005-315/" data-ref-id="3005-315">Cortana</a>, which is meant to compete with Apple's Siri. For gaming, Windows 10 introduces DirectX 12, which allows programmers to get better performance out of older graphics hardware with less oversight. Although current graphics cards can support some of the features of DirectX 12, fully-featured DX12 cards are not expected to release until 2016. The first game to support DX12 will be Fable Legends, which is releasing as a free-to-play title by the end of 2015. It also introduces further connections with the Xbox brand, where Microsoft will be selling games with the Xbox brand on the App Store as well as allow you to stream games from the Xbox One on all Windows 10 devices.</p><h3>Mac OS</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1650297-macosx102.png" data-ref-id="1300-1650297" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1650297-macosx102.png" data-ref-id="1300-1650297"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3661/1650297-macosx102.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3661/1650297-macosx102.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Apple's Mac OS has a limited but growing game library.</figcaption></figure><p style="">In 1977, <a href="/steve-wozniak/3040-93519/" data-ref-id="3040-93519">Steve Wozniak</a> and <a href="/steve-jobs/3040-9951/" data-ref-id="3040-9951">Steve Jobs</a> made the Apple 1, Apple's first computer.

It allows game developers to use more hardware resources from devices using Mac OS X or <a href="/iphone/3045-96/" data-ref-id="3045-96">iOS</a> to gain better performance. This allows devices such as Macbooks and the <a href="/ipad/3045-121/" data-ref-id="3045-121">iPad</a> to run games with comparable performance to Windows PCs and consoles. Because of Metal, it was announced that Frostbite 3 is coming to Mac OS X and iOS, with its flagship title being <a href="/plants-vs-zombies-garden-warfare/3030-42887/" data-ref-id="3030-42887">Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare</a>.</p><h3>Linux</h3><p style=""><a href="/linux/3045-152/" data-ref-id="3045-152">Linux</a> is a Unix-like OS licenced under the GPL. Unlike Windows and Mac OS, which require specific hardware for the OS to work properly, Linux is a software-based OS, which can be installed on a variety of devices, including devices which are not PC-based. Linux comes in various distributions, or "distros," such as Ubuntu or Gentoo. Being an open source OS, the Linux community actively develops open source software, including games, for the Linux platform. However, there is no requirement that Linux software be open-source. You can get many Windows applications to work on Linux using specific Windows coding software for Linux (such as <a href="/playable-via-wine/3015-2497/" data-ref-id="3015-2497">WINE</a>) but it is generally not a preferable way of playing Windows games compared to running them in Windows on the same machine. Furthermore, WINE is not compatible with PowerPCs including PS3s with Linux installed. A popular option for overcoming Windows compatibility issues is to multi-boot the Linux distro with a version of Windows so that both operating systems are installed on the same PC at once and the user can switch between them.</p><p style="">There has been increased development for Linux games in recent years, with many indie games, such as <a href="/minecraft/3030-30475/" data-ref-id="3030-30475">Minecraft</a>, releasing a Linux version. The <a href="/humble-bundle/3015-6612/" data-ref-id="3015-6612">Humble Indie Bundle</a> typically includes Linux versions of games in addition to Mac and PC. Valve released the beta of their popular <a href="/steam/3015-718/" data-ref-id="3015-718">Steam platform</a> for Linux (Starting with Ubuntu) in Nov. 2012 after their founder <a href="/gabe-newell/3040-4498/" data-ref-id="3040-4498">Gabe Newell</a> expressed support for the platform. In 2013, Valve announced that they will be releasing their own Linux distro called SteamOS, which will be installed in all "Steam Boxes". It is a derivative of Ubuntu that has an interface similar to Big Picture Mode that can be navigated using a controller. It allows users to stream games from another PC so users can run games that are currently not compatible with Linux. However, support for Linux gaming has been growing over the years, with many games, including indie and AAA titles, having Linux versions being released at launch.</p><p style="">The most popular Linux-based OS on the market right now is <a href="/android/3045-123/" data-ref-id="3045-123">Android</a>. It is a growing, open source mobile operating system with a growing gaming library. However, it is important to note that most Linux-PC applications are incompatible with Android and vice-verse (without a significant amount of effort).</p><h2>Components of a PC</h2><p style="">There are many replaceable parts in a PC, which is a main aspect separating them from consoles. PCs may be upgraded and maintained as time passes to keep up with the latest games, and a user's configuration will affect which games they can play. The main parts of a computer are as follows:</p><ul><li><b>CPU</b> <i>(Central Processing Unit)</i> - The processing unit that executes operations in a computer. It consists of an integrated circuit built of many transistors that runs on binary code. The CPU communicates with the rest of the computer through the Northbridge via a front side bus. Most medium and high end processors are 64-bit and have several cores which is known as parallel processing. The CPU creates a lot of heat and as a result requires its own dedicated heatsink or waterblock even on a low end computer.</li><li><b>GPU</b> <i>(Graphics Processing Unit)</i> - The dedicated graphics rendering device, very important for games. The GPU generally has its own circuit board which is slotted into the motherboard, the processing unit its self is also made up of many transistors and is heavily based on parallel processing. The GPU also uses its own dedicated RAM for storing texture data to be processed. Current generation GPUs are capable of rendering shader model 4.1 processes as part of the DirectX 11 package. Many graphics cards are also compatible with <a href="/opengl/3015-5192/" data-ref-id="3015-5192">OpenGL</a>.</li><li><b>Motherboard</b> - The main circuit board in a PC that all the components connect to. Its through this board that all other components may communicate between each other and is run by a set of North and South bridge chipsets, though newer CPUs actually include an integrated nothrbridge.</li><li><b>RAM</b> (<i>Random Access Memory</i>) - Volatile dynamic memory of a system. Data can be temporarily loaded here to be accessed much faster than from the hard drive or even a solid state drive so not to slow the calculations made by the CPU. The current standard is DDR3.</li><li><b>PSU</b> <i>(Power Supply Unit)</i> - Supplies power to the PC. Needs to have high enough power (measured in Watts) to run all the components in the system under high load.</li><li><b>HDD</b> <i>(Hard Disk Drive)</i> - The main storage device of a PC.</li><li><strong>SSD</strong> <em>(Solid State Drive)</em> - A type of storage similar to a hard drive, but contain no moving parts. Because of this, data stored in solid state drives can be accessed and written quicker than hard drives.</li><li><b>Sound Card</b> - An expansion card that processes audio on a separate chip. Most motherboards provide integrated sound chips making sound cards an optional upgrade.</li><li><b>ODD</b> <i>(Optical Disc Drive)</i> - The peripheral device that reads optical discs such as DVDs, BDs, and CDs.</li><li><b>Case</b> - Houses the components.</li><li><b>Monitor</b> - The visual display unit of a computer.</li><li><strong>Input Devices</strong> - Mouse, keyboard, microphone, etc. Because of the uptake of the Xbox 360 most games from 2005 onward will work with the Xbox 360 controller. This is also helped by the fact that the Xbox 360 has a USB connection that allows game developers to easily port the control system from current console games to the PC. In 2014, Microsoft released drivers that allowed Xbox One controllers to work for all 360 controller-compatible games.</li><li><b>Cooling</b> - Commonly either water or air based. With standard cooling devices the lowest possible temperature is the ambient temperature, that of the room the system resides in. To further lower the temperature elaborate devices such as Peltier coolers, liquid gases or phase cooling may be installed, though this is best left to the extreme enthusiast due to the risk of most of these options.</li></ul><h2>Graphic Settings</h2><p style="">Unlike their console equivalents most PC games have the ability to vary the graphical settings. This feature is inherent to PCs as few systems bear the same hardware and so the user must tailor the game's settings for optimal performance and visual quality. With modern hardware PCs can often surpass their console counterparts in terms of technical graphics. Recent titles offer the option to set the ideal configuration of a game automatically. Such settings include:</p><ul><li><b>Resolution</b> - The number of pixels along the x and y axes to which the game will render.</li><li><b>Anti-Aliasing</b> - Raises the quality of the edges of polygon based models using smoothing algorithms.</li><li><b>Anisotropic Filtering</b> - Raises the quality of textures viewed from obtuse angles.</li><li><b>Texture Quality</b> - General resolution of the paint scheme of each model.</li><li><b>Model Quality</b> - General number of polygons used for each model.</li><li><a href="/hdr-high-dynamic-range/3015-618/" data-ref-id="3015-618"><b>High Dynamic Range lighting</b></a> - Allows for dynamic tone mapping in games.</li><li><b>Shader Model</b> - Technology a game can use to render advanced visual effects.</li><li><b>Vsync</b> - Reduces an artifact known as <i>tearing</i> by synchronizing the frame rate and refresh rate of the monitor.</li></ul><h2>Game Lineup</h2><h3>Early History</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6384/614050-worldofwarcraftboxart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-614050" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.4320652173913" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:143.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6384/614050-worldofwarcraftboxart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-614050"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6384/614050-worldofwarcraftboxart.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6384/614050-worldofwarcraftboxart.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Blizzard is one of the most prominent PC developers.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Computers first featured simple titles similar to <a href="/spacewar/3030-21514/" data-ref-id="3030-21514">SpaceWar!</a> or simple text-input games such as <a href="/pool-of-radiance/3030-16452/" data-ref-id="3030-16452">Adventure</a> but have since evolved to become the leading platform for cutting-edge game development in the 21st century due to their seemingly limitless potential.</p><p style="">Old computers such as the <a href="/commodore-64/3045-14/" data-ref-id="3045-14">Commodore 64</a> and <a href="/nec-pc-9801/3045-112/" data-ref-id="3045-112">NEC PC-98</a> featured a built-in controller port, for C64 controllers as well as <a href="/atari-2600/3045-40/" data-ref-id="3045-40">Atari 2600</a> and other controllers. Many games supported both keyboard and joystick input. Since mice have become standard, they have become the preferable method of input for many games, with various manufacturers branding mice specifically for gaming. Joysticks are still widely used via USB. Early games were simply saved onto floppy disks by a publisher or even the programmer themselves. These disks were sold in Ziploc bags and Vinyl slips; they generally had a bland manual and had nowhere near the shelf-presentation of a modern game. Modern games are distributed mainly on optical discs in hard plastic cases or cardboard boxes. There has been a large surge in digital distribution as well.</p><h3>Evolution in the 1990s</h3><p style="">In the early days of computer gaming, most games were developed by a single programmer, and were often simple <a href="/games/?sort=release_date&amp;filter_type=genre&amp;filter_value=36/">text adventures</a> or downgraded ports/clones of more powerful <a href="/arcade/3045-84/" data-ref-id="3045-84">arcade</a> games. PC gaming has since evolved to encompass a wide variety of genres, some faring better than others.</p><p style="">The most popular genres that have evolved on the platform are the <a href="/games/?sort=release_date&amp;filter_type=genre&amp;filter_value=5/">CRPG</a> (<i>Computer Role-Playing Game</i>), <a href="/games/?sort=release_date&amp;filter_type=genre&amp;filter_value=12/">RTS</a> <i>(<a href="/real-time-combat/3015-2332/" data-ref-id="3015-2332">Real-Time</a> Strategy</i>), and <a href="/games/?sort=release_date&amp;filter_type=genre&amp;filter_value=32/">FPS</a> (<em><a href="/first-person-perspective/3015-330/" data-ref-id="3015-330">First-Person</a> Shooter</em>).</p><p style="">CRPG's were largely inspired by pen &amp; paper role playing games such as <a href="/dungeons-dragons/3025-167/" data-ref-id="3025-167">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a>. The genre spans early ASCII adventures such as <a href="/rogue/3030-22309/" data-ref-id="3030-22309">Rogue</a>, action RPG's such as <a href="/dragon-slayer/3025-783/" data-ref-id="3025-783">Dragon Slayer</a> and <a href="/diablo/3030-5985/" data-ref-id="3030-5985">Diablo</a>, and <a href="/games/?sort=release_date&amp;filter_type=genre&amp;filter_value=16/">MMORPGs</a> (Massively Multiplayer Online RPGs) such as <a href="/lineage/3025-623/" data-ref-id="3025-623">Lineage</a> and <a href="/world-of-warcraft/3030-19783/" data-ref-id="3030-19783">World of Warcraft</a>. Freedom is a main element that has evolved with CRPG's. The earlier games were more linear in their approach, sometimes even approaching level design from a distinct "stages" standpoint. CRPGs evolved to have <a href="/polygonal-3d/3015-1430/" data-ref-id="3015-1430">3D</a> <a href="/dungeon/3035-1131/" data-ref-id="3035-1131">dungeons</a>, <a href="/real-time-combat/3015-2332/" data-ref-id="3015-2332">real time combat</a>, and huge multiplayer, <a href="/open-world/3015-207/" data-ref-id="3015-207">non-linear worlds</a>.</p><p style="">Real-Time Strategy games, such as <a href="/starcraft/3030-13062/" data-ref-id="3030-13062">Starcraft</a> and <a href="/command-conquer/3030-4384/" data-ref-id="3030-4384">Command &amp; Conquer</a>, is a genre that was at the heart of PC gaming in the 1990s and continues to remain a dominant PC genre in <a href="/asia/3035-1663/" data-ref-id="3035-1663">Asian</a> countries like <a href="/south-korea/3035-2410/" data-ref-id="3035-2410">South Korea</a> and <a href="/china/3035-343/" data-ref-id="3035-343">China</a>. The genre requires fast-paced clicking using a mouse, making implementation on consoles very difficult; ironically, the game often considered the first RTS, <a href="/herzog-zwei/3030-11439/" data-ref-id="3030-11439">Herzog Zwei</a>, was a <a href="/genesis/3045-6/" data-ref-id="3045-6">Sega Mega Drive / Genesis</a> console game. The genre has certainly seen evolution, but the premise of collecting resources, spawning an army, and sending it into battle, has remained relatively constant throughout RTS history. Today, the most popular RTS games are called <a href="/multiplayer-online-battle-arena/3015-6598/" data-ref-id="3015-6598">MOBAs</a> (Multiplayer Online Battle Arenas), with games such as <a href="/league-of-legends/3030-24024/" data-ref-id="3030-24024">League of Legends</a> and <a href="/dota-2/3030-32887/" data-ref-id="3030-32887">DOTA 2</a> being some of the most played games in the world.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14982/1228664-steam2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1228664" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14982/1228664-steam2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1228664"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14982/1228664-steam2.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14982/1228664-steam2.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Steam comprises over 70% of the digital distribution market.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The third, and arguably most popular, PC genre is the FPS. After being popularized with <a href="/id-software/3010-347/" data-ref-id="3010-347">iD Software</a>'s <a href="/wolfenstein-3d/3030-7694/" data-ref-id="3030-7694">Wolfenstein 3D</a>, the genre exploded into popularity with <a href="/doom/3025-156/" data-ref-id="3025-156">Doom</a>. The use of mouse a mouse to look around was later popularized by <a href="/duke-nukem-3d/3030-3407/" data-ref-id="3030-3407">Duke Nukem 3D</a> and <a href="/quake/3025-425/" data-ref-id="3025-425">Quake</a>. It's a genre that has been ported to consoles, but still controls better on PC due to quick, precise aiming with mice. Landmark PC FPS games include <a href="/doom/3030-7326/" data-ref-id="3030-7326">Doom</a>, <a href="/quake/3030-8015/" data-ref-id="3030-8015">Quake</a>, <a href="/counter-strike/3025-114/" data-ref-id="3025-114">Counter-Strike</a>, and <a href="/half-life/3030-2980/" data-ref-id="3030-2980">Half-Life</a>.</p><p style="">The PC game industry has seen a steady push towards consoles for many years now, due to low sales numbers. These sales are often attributed to illegal downloading as well as the cost of upgrading one's system. The PC industry is largely kept alive by the convenience of having many games at ones fingertips on a PC as well as the superiority of certain genres on the platform.</p><p style="">However, PC gaming has seen a massive resurgence of popularity within the last few years thanks to the growing popularity of Steam, the massive success of indie titles such as <a href="/minecraft/3030-30475/" data-ref-id="3030-30475">Minecraft</a> and <a href="/dayz/3030-39256/" data-ref-id="3030-39256">DayZ</a>, and the rise of eSports with games such as League of Legends, DOTA 2, and <a href="/counter-strike-global-offensive/3030-36113/" data-ref-id="3030-36113">Counter Strike: Global Offensive</a>.</p><h3>Digital Distribution</h3><p style="">However, even with retail PC game sales slowing, digital distribution has been expanding within the last few years. Popular digital distribution services like <a href="/valve-corporation/3010-1374/" data-ref-id="3010-1374">Valve</a>'s <a href="/steam/3015-718/" data-ref-id="3015-718">Steam</a>, <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/electronic-arts/3010-1/" data-ref-id="3010-1">EA</a>'s <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/origin/3015-7040/" data-ref-id="3015-7040">Origin</a>, and <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/desura/3015-6514/" data-ref-id="3015-6514">Desura</a> helped in boosting the sales of PC games and have helped in making many indie games popular. Other digital distributors, like <a href="/good-old-games/3015-2379/" data-ref-id="3015-2379">GOG</a>, sell older PC games that either don't sell in retail anymore or are too old to be compatible with newer operating systems. These services allow you to play older games and usually sell them for less than $10 while also being free of DRM. The <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/humble-bundle/3015-6612/" data-ref-id="3015-6612">Humble Indie Bundle</a> and other alternatives have been a great resource in downloading numerous indie and retail games for prices set by the end user. The majority of the proceeds go to the game developers as well as numerous charities. These type of services help in having an easy way to play PC games and having developers keep in touch with their communities.</p><h2>Issues</h2><h3>Upgrading</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1650290-nvidia_fermi_class_quadro_professional_gpus_announced_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1650290" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.61487603305785" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:61.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1650290-nvidia_fermi_class_quadro_professional_gpus_announced_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1650290"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3661/1650290-nvidia_fermi_class_quadro_professional_gpus_announced_2.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3661/1650290-nvidia_fermi_class_quadro_professional_gpus_announced_2.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>NVidia's popular GeForce series of GPUs.</figcaption></figure><p style="">A primary issue with PC gaming is the barrier to entry due to cost. Pricing of a PC depends on what type of performance a user wants when it comes to playing games, but for people who want to play games at maximum settings, it can cost at least $1000 to build and up to $3000 to buy from a manufacturer. In order to play some of the biggest, most graphically impressive games on PC at maximum settings with a stable framerate, it may require a user to upgrade their computer components every 2-3 years. However, thanks to better optimization of games and the creation of lower level APIs such as AMD's Mantle, the barrier of entry for PC gaming has been decreasing and lower-end hardware can be used to run games with decent performance.</p><p style="">The ability to selectively upgrade hardware also gives PC gamers a flexibility absent in console gaming. Users can upgrade RAM, GPU or hard drives to make their computers more powerful as the games become more demanding. In turn, this flexibility and constant increase in performance allows developers to create games that can fully utilize the latest hardware, often leading to more complex or better looking games.</p><h3>Piracy and Digital Rights Management</h3><p style="">One huge problem reported by publishers with PC gaming is the excessive piracy of games. Bootleg copies of games have been a problem since the introduction of the personal computer. Many computer experts were able to copy floppy disks and distribute them to either share with friends or profit off them. Since the introduction of the internet, it has been easier to distribute pirated software than ever before (including games). Bittorrent sites make it easier for people to put up game files where everyone can download and play.</p><p style="">Although piracy ranges across the world, the areas with the most piracy are developing nations. These are areas that either have poor game distribution or have gamers that are too poor to afford many games. Piracy has also gone up since the economic crash of 2008.</p><p style="">There are many measures that game publishers use in attempts to prevent piracy. Floppy disk games of the 1980's included items in their game boxes called "feelies", or items necessary to have in order to play the game. Some games required the player to look in the instruction manual and type in a specific word to play the game while others had the player decrypt a code displayed on a screen using one of the items in the box. As CD games became more popular and CD copiers were gaining traction, CD keys, unique codes to identify legitimately purchased games, were introduced. Sometimes CD keys are used to access certain parts of a game such as multiplayer and Live features in <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/games-for-windows-live/3015-2452/" data-ref-id="3015-2452">Games for Windows Live</a> games. There have been many issues with CD keys. If you were to lose your CD key and needed to reinstall a game, you had to buy your game again. This type of security did not last long because pirates were finding ways to create fake CD keys that they could use to play pirated games. Digital Distribution has made CD keys mostly obsolete.</p><p style="">This led game publishers and various third parties to develop forms of <a href="/digital-rights-management/3015-1704/" data-ref-id="3015-1704">Digital Rights Management</a> (DRM). DRM is digtal software protection that prevents the user from using copied game discs and downloaded disc images or installing games on multiple machines. Some early forms of DRM may interfere with some applications such as disc drive emulation software used for mounting disc images.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1650293-activationfailed2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1650293" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.875" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:87.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1650293-activationfailed2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1650293"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3661/1650293-activationfailed2.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3661/1650293-activationfailed2.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Activation failure screen for GTA IV.</figcaption></figure><p style="">There have been controversial uses of DRM within the last few years. In 2008, <a href="/ea-games/3010-6256/" data-ref-id="3010-6256">EA</a> announced that they are going to use a new version of <a href="/securom/3015-2720/" data-ref-id="3015-2720">SecuROM</a> DRM that limits the number of simultaneous activated installs for all of their new PC games (starting with <a href="/mass-effect/3030-16909/" data-ref-id="3030-16909">Mass Effect</a> and <a href="/spore/3030-14139/" data-ref-id="3030-14139">Spore</a>). Since then there has been a huge controversy over DRM, even questioning the legality of it.</p><p style="">In 2009, <a href="/ubisoft-entertainment/3010-82/" data-ref-id="3010-82">Ubisoft</a> introduced a new DRM that will require you to be online at all times when playing a game. If you are disconnected from the internet for any reason, gameplay will stop. The first games to utilize the new DRM were <a href="/assassins-creed-ii/3030-22928/" data-ref-id="3030-22928">Assassin's Creed II</a> and <a href="/silent-hunter-v-battle-of-the-atlantic/3030-28094/" data-ref-id="3030-28094">Silent Hunter 5</a>. As of 2011, Ubisoft decided to discontinue and retool their online DRM system with the release of <a href="/assassins-creed-brotherhood/3030-31001/" data-ref-id="3030-31001">Assassin's Creed Brotherhood</a>, and was relaunched with the release of <a href="/driver-san-francisco/3030-31634/" data-ref-id="3030-31634">Driver: San Francisco</a>. Today, Ubisoft has their own digital platform, <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/uplay/3015-4289/" data-ref-id="3015-4289">Uplay</a>, that is needed to access many of their games.</p><p style="">Common complaints about this type of DRM are losing game progress and not being able to play when an internet connection is unavailable. Other companies are using similar DRM including EA with <a href="/command-conquer-4-tiberian-twilight/3030-27130/" data-ref-id="3030-27130">Command and Conquer 4</a> and <a href="/blizzard-entertainment/3010-1088/" data-ref-id="3010-1088">Blizzard</a> with <a href="/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/3030-20674/" data-ref-id="3030-20674">StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty</a> and <a href="/diablo-iii/3030-20803/" data-ref-id="3030-20803">Diablo III</a>. Both <a href="/command-conquer-4-tiberian-twilight/3030-27130/" data-ref-id="3030-27130">C&amp;C4</a> and <a href="/diablo-iii/3030-20803/" data-ref-id="3030-20803">D3</a> require a constant, active connection to the host servers, but Blizzard's implementation in <a href="/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/3030-20674/" data-ref-id="3030-20674">SC2</a> allows offline play of the single player campaign and AI versus modes with achievement functionality disabled.</p><p style="">Many digital distributors feature their own DRM. Steam requires users to connect to their servers at least once and enable offline mode before playing games offline. In Steam's offline mode, achievements are deactivated. Microsoft's Games For Windows Live has similar restrictions.</p>]]></description>

It was the most powerful home gaming system of the 1980s.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<p style="">The Sharp X68000 is a 16/32-bit <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">home computer</a> manufactured by <a href="/sharp-corporation/3010-6509/" data-ref-id="3010-6509">Sharp Corporation</a> and co-developed by <a href="/hudson-entertainment-inc/3010-419/" data-ref-id="3010-419">Hudson</a>. It was revealed in October 1986 and released in February 1987 in <a href="/japan/3035-37/" data-ref-id="3035-37">Japan</a>. It was the successor to the 8-bit <a href="/sharp-mz/3045-128/" data-ref-id="3045-128">Sharp MZ</a> and <a href="/sharp-x1/3045-113/" data-ref-id="3045-113">Sharp X1</a> computers. At launch, the X68000 was initially sold at an expensive price of ¥369,000 (roughly $3000 in 1987 dollars, equivalent to around $6000 in 2012 dollars).</p><p style="">Based on arcade architecture, the X68000 was the first home system to offer <a href="/arcade/3045-84/" data-ref-id="3045-84">arcade</a> quality graphics, which was almost unheard of at the time. Like arcade machines, much of the X68000's advanced graphical capabilities came from the use of custom GPU graphics processors, which were improved with later hardware revisions. As a result, it had a large number of arcade-perfect conversions and even served as the development machine for <a href="/capcom/3010-367/" data-ref-id="3010-367">Capcom</a>'s CPS <a href="/arcade/3045-84/" data-ref-id="3045-84">arcade </a>system over the next several years since it released. The X68000 remained the most powerful home gaming system up until the release of the <a href="/neo-geo/3045-25/" data-ref-id="3045-25">Neo Geo</a> arcade-based console in 1990.</p><p style="">Its main 16-bit rivals in the <a href="/japan/3035-37/" data-ref-id="3035-37">Japanese</a> computer market were the <a href="/nec-pc-9801/3045-112/" data-ref-id="3045-112">NEC PC-98</a>, launched in 1982, and the <a href="/fm-towns/3045-108/" data-ref-id="3045-108">FM Towns</a>, launched in 1989. The PC-98 would remain the computer market leader in Japan up until the mid-1980s, while the X68000 and FM Towns fought for second place, up until the arrival of Windows 95 on the <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">IBM PC</a> slowly began dominating over local Japanese competition around the late 1990s.</p><h2>Operating System</h2><p style="">The X68K runs an operating system called Human68k, which was developed jointly by <a href="/sharp-corporation/3010-6509/" data-ref-id="3010-6509">Sharp</a> and <a href="/hudson-entertainment-inc/3010-419/" data-ref-id="3010-419">Hudson Soft</a>. Human68k operates similarly to MS-DOS. Executable files end in an extension of ".X".</p><p style="">At least three major versions of the operating system were released, with a number of minor releases between.</p><p style="">The X68000 was one of the first computers to feature soft-on power, where the main power supply was always on and the front-mounted power switch would only signal the machine to shut down, giving software time to save, shutdown and usually fade out the sound and the screen. This was a precursor to most modern operating systems.</p><h3>Graphical Shell</h3><p style="">Early models included a graphical shell called VS ("Visual Shell"). This was later replaced by Sx-window, which had a look and feel similar to NeXT. Sx-window was too slow to be used for games, and very little video game software was developed for it.</p><h2>Hardware Specifications</h2><p style="">The Sharp X68000 had similar hardware specs as the average <a href="/arcade/3045-84/" data-ref-id="3045-84">arcade </a>cabinet hardware of the late 80's, as well as <a href="/2d/3015-1427/" data-ref-id="3015-1427">2D</a> arcade machines into the early 90's. Like arcade machines (as well as the later <a href="/neo-geo/3045-25/" data-ref-id="3045-25">Neo Geo</a> arcade/console system), much of the X68000's advanced graphical capabilities came from the use of custom GPU graphics processors, which were improved with later hardware revisions. Because of this, it featured a large number of games that were perfectly ported from the arcades to the X68000, making it the most powerful home gaming system of the 1980s.</p><p style=""><b>MAIN PROCESSORS</b></p><ul><li>Main CPU (Central Processing Unit) processor: <ul><li>1987: Hitachi HD68HC000 (based on 16/32-bit Motorola 68000) @ 10 MHz <ul><li>Performance: 1.8 MIPS (Million Instructions Per Second)</li></ul></li><li>1990: Hitachi HD68HC000 @ 10-15 MHz (1.8-2.7 MIPS)</li><li>1991: Motorola 68000 (16/32-bit) @ 16 MHz (2.8 MIPS)</li><li>1992: Motorola MC68EC030 (32-bit Motorola 68030) @ 25 MHz (9 MIPS)</li><li>1993: Motorola 68030 (32-bit) @ 33 MHz (12 MIPS)</li><li>1993: <a href="/sharp-corporation/3010-6509/" data-ref-id="3010-6509">Sharp</a> Jupiter-X 040turbo (based on 32-bit Motorola 68040) @ 25-40 MHz <ul><li>Performance: 28-44 MIPS, 4-6 MFLOPS (Million Floating-point Operations Per Sec)</li></ul></li><li>1994: Sharp Jupiter-X 060turbo / Venus-X 060 (32-bit Motorola 68060) @ 50-75 MHz <ul><li>Performance: 76-114 MIPS, 28-42 MFLOPS</li></ul></li><li>Cancelled: <a href="/ibm/3010-190/" data-ref-id="3010-190">IBM</a> PowerPC 601 (32-bit) @ 66 MHz (~100 MIPS, ~66 MFLOPS)</li></ul></li><li>Upgradable CPU: <ul><li>1992: Motorola 68030 (32-bit) @ 25-50 MHz (9-18 MIPS)</li><li>1993: Jupiter-X 040turbo (Motorola 68040) @ 25-40 MHz (28-44 MIPS, 4-6 MFLOPS)</li><li>1994: Jupiter-X 060turbo (Motorola 68060) @ 50-80 MHz (76-122 MIPS, 28-44 MFLOPS)</li></ul></li><li>Additional CPU: <ul><li>1989: Sharp CONCERTO-X68K (16-bit <a href="/nec-home-electronics-ltd/3010-2708/" data-ref-id="3010-2708">NEC</a> V30 @ 5-66 MHz) (1-35 MIPS)</li><li>1992: Sharp VDTK-X68K (32-bit NEC V70 @ 20-50 MHz) (6-15 MIPS)</li></ul></li><li>FPU (Floating-Point Unit) math co-processor: <ul><li>1990: Banchu Bronta 6 / Banchu Cammago 4007 (based on AMD/Intel)</li><li>1991: <a href="/sharp-corporation/3010-6509/" data-ref-id="3010-6509">Sharp</a> CZ-6BP1 / CZ-6BP1A (based on 32-bit Motorola MC 68881) @ 16-25 MHz <ul><li>Performance: 160-240 kFLOPS (kiloFLOPS / thousand FLOPS)</li></ul></li><li>1992: Motorola MC 68882 (32-bit) @ 25-50 MHz <ul><li>Performance: 254-528 kFLOPS</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>MCU (Micro-Controller Unit) co-processor: <ul><li>1987: Oki MSM80C51 (8-bit, CMOS)</li><li>1990: Intel 80C51 (8-bit, CMOS)</li></ul></li><li>System controller: BUDDHA (1987), MESSIAH (1988), SCOTCH (1989), DOSA (1991)</li></ul><p style=""><b>DISPLAY / GRAPHICS</b></p><ul><li>GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) processors: <ul><li>Sprite controller: CYNTHIA Jr (1987), CYNTHIA (1988)</li><li>CRT controller: VINAS 1 + 2 (1987), VICON (1988)</li><li>Video controller: VSOP (1987), VIPS (1988)</li><li>Video data selector: RESERVE (1987), CATHY (1988)</li></ul></li><li>Resolution: <ul><li>1987: 256x240, 256x256, 512x240, 512x256, 512x512, 640x480, 768x512, 1024x1024</li><li>1994: 256x240, 256x256, 512x240, 512x256, 512x512, 640x480, 768x512, 1024x768, 1024x1024, 1280x1024</li></ul></li><li>Color palette: <ul><li>1987: 16-bit (65,536 colors)</li><li>1994: 24-bit (16.78 million colors) with TS-6BGA graphics accelerator</li></ul></li><li>Colors on screen: <ul><li>1987: 4-bit (16 colors @ 1024x1024) to 8-bit (256 colors @ 512x512)</li><li>1988: <ul><li>4-bit (16 colors @ 1024x1024)</li><li>9-bit (512 colors @ 512x512, 2 planes)</li><li>16-bit (65,536 colors @ 512x512, 1 plane)</li></ul></li><li>1994: (With TS-6BGA graphics accelerator) <ul><li>8-bit (256 colors @ 1280x1024) to 24-bit (16.78 million colors @ 1024x768)</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Sprites: 128 hardware sprites on screen @ 16x16 pixels each <ul><li>Upgradable: Up to 1024 sprites</li></ul></li><li>Planes: 4 (@1024x1024) to 16 (@ 512x512)</li><li>Possible AV outputs:<b> </b>VGA (Monitor Output) Component (RGB)</li><li>Graphics hardware: Hardware scrolling, priority control, super-impose</li><li>Graphics accelerator cards: <ul><li>Sharp CZ-6BP1 &amp;

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>About</h2><p style="">iPhone is a smartphone designed by <a href="/apple-inc/3010-5815/" data-ref-id="3010-5815">Apple</a>, sold in many countries and on many mobile carriers. What makes iPhone special from past mobile phones is its minimalist design and heavily reliance on a touch screen instead of buttons. iPhone sports many features that make it attractive as not only a phone, but a general purpose computing device. More importantly, iPhone has recently gained a massive foothold in the handheld gaming market through the App Store, allowing users to easily download apps from the device itself. With iPhone's massive popularity and considered by many to be their primary gaming platform, major publishers such as <a href="/gameloft-china/3010-6003/" data-ref-id="3010-6003">Gameloft</a>, <a href="/ea-games/3010-6256/" data-ref-id="3010-6256">EA</a>, <a href="/epic-games/3010-149/" data-ref-id="3010-149">Epic Games</a> and <a href="/sega/3010-62/" data-ref-id="3010-62">Sega</a> have all released games for iPhone.</p><h2>Specifications</h2><p style="">The iPhone is a very capable platform in terms of processing power. It has a 620 MHz ARM 1176 underclocked to 400 MHz processor, 128 MB eDRAM as well as a PowerVR MBX graphics processing unit. This allows it to run 3D and sprite-based games which put most phones' graphical capabilities to shame. Graphics are run through OpenGL, however it is the less-powerful Embedded System version. The iPhone 3GS has a 833 MHz ARM Cortex-A8 underclocked to 600 MHz, 256 MB eDRAM, and a PowerVR SGX GPU.</p><p style="">The iPhone 4 has the ARM Cortex-A8CPU integrated with a PowerVR SGX 535 GPU and 515 MB eDRAM.</p><p style="">There are some issues for running games on the iPhone, the main one being a lack of a tactile input. The iPhone is controlled via a combination of a touch screen, which can recognize multiple points of contact, as well as an accelerometer, which can sense movement of the device. These methods of input can work well for many genres, including racing, puzzle, and adventure games. However the lack of physical button-based input can inhibit more traditional action-based games, platformers, etc. due to the finger needing to obscure the screen. <a href="/virtual-joystick/3015-4951/" data-ref-id="3015-4951">Virtual buttons</a> may be used instead, but that takes up space on the rather small screen and lacks tactile feedback and the ability to be pressure sensitive. Unlike the <a href="/nintendo-ds/3045-52/" data-ref-id="3045-52">Nintendo DS</a>, the iPhone's screen is not sensitive to physical pressure, but only disturbances through bioelectric contact such as skin -- the former being known as resistive and the latter capacitive. This is why using a plastic stylus or most inorganic objects will not register input.</p><p style=""> </p><h2>Different Models</h2><p style="">Since the original iPhone release, Apple have upgraded the model with three new releases, the iPhone 3G boasted a new streamlined design, replacing the aluminum backing for a more suited black plastic. It also introduced 3G to the iPhone, which was a feature that many critics complained about the original not having, considering it was a smartphone and a GPS. The iPhone 3GS released in 2009 claimed to be "twice as fast" as the 3G, it also has a 3.0 megapixel camera that takes stills and video, compared to the iPhone and the 3G's fixed focus 2.0 megapixel camera, which could not record video. Additionally, the 3GS added a digital compass.</p><p style="">In June 2010, the iPhone 4 was released. The iPhone was vastly improved now, with a faster CPU, a higher resolution "retina" display, noise suppressing dual microphones, a 5.0 megapixel camera and a newly added front-facing camera, longer battery life, and a design change which made it distinct from older models.</p><h3>iPhone 4S</h3><p style="">On October 4 2011, Apple announced the iPhone 4S. Changes include a new 8MP camera,1080p video recording, an improved antenna, Apple's A5 dual core processor and Siri, a voice controlled assistant. It released on October 14, 2011.</p><h3>iPhone 5</h3><p style="">The iPhone 5 was released on September 21, 2012. The phone is slimmer, lighter, and also introduced the first 4" screen. It was also the first iPhone to support LTE. Apple put a their new A6 processor, and added 1GB of RAM.</p><h3>iPhone 5s and 5c</h3><p style="">The iPhone 5s and 5c were announced on September 10, 2013 and launched on September 20, 2013. The iPhone 5s uses a 64-bit A7 processor, while the lower-end iPhone 5c uses the A6 processor previously used in the iPhone 5. The iPhone 5s also adds a fingerprint scanner, which is not present on the iPhone 5c. Fingerprint data is stored within a "secure enclave" on the A7 chip.</p><h2>Jailbreaking</h2><p style="">Jailbreaking is a process that allows the iPhone and iPod Touch to run unsigned code on, bypassing Apple's official distribution platform, the App Store. Once jailbroken, iPhone users are able to download many applications previously unavailable through the App Store due to Apple's rules.</p><p style="">Jailbreaking is condemned by Apple and will cause any standing warranty on an iPhone or iPod Touch product to become null and void.</p><p style=""> </p><h2>The iPod Touch</h2><p style="">The iPod Touch looks a lot like the iPhone, but there are a few key differences between the two. The most notable of these differences is the fact that the iPod touch does not have a GSM radio built into it, and therefore cannot use a cellular network with which to make phone calls or access the internet, though it does include Wi-Fi. The first generations did not have a built-in camera or microphone, but the second generation (2G, 2008) of the hardware does include an internal speaker and adds support for an external microphone. The fourth generation (4G, 2010) now includes a built-in microphone and also a camera which can record both images and video. Like the iPhone, the iPod touch runs iPhone OS. The iPhone OS 3.0 on the iPod touch unlocks Bluetooth (for 2G touch), landscape keyboard in more apps, peer-to-peer gameplay, and several other new features. The iPod Touch functions much like the iPhone, but is slightly smaller, lighter, and can be purchased without a phone contract.</p><p style=""> </p><h2>Game Center</h2><p style="">Game Center is Apple's gaming platform for the iPod Touch, iPhone and <a href="/ipad/3045-121/" data-ref-id="3045-121">iPad</a>, which was announced as part of the iPhone OS 4.0 on April 8, 2010. The new platform will work as a social gaming network, with the ability to track friends and invite them to games, matchmaking, <a href="/leaderboard/3015-30/" data-ref-id="3015-30">leaderboards</a> and <a href="/achievements/3015-29/" data-ref-id="3015-29">achievements</a>. Game Center will replace other gaming networks on the iPhone such as <a href="/openfeint/3015-4240/" data-ref-id="3015-4240">OpenFeint</a>, and allow for a more wholesome experience. The network was supposed to launch as part of iPhone OS 4.0 in June 2010, but was delayed to September 2010.</p>]]></description>

It allows players to subscribe and connect to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St.GIGA" rel="nofollow">St. GIGA</a> and download games and news updated from 4-7PM. The unit was released in 1995 and retailed for ¥14,000. Some games could only be played at certain times, while others were downloaded to the BS-X Cassette, a small memory cartridge. The service was supported up until 2000 with the last game release being in 1999. Sales numbers are unknown for the device, although it gained a good deal of support.</p><h2>Hardware</h2><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/874511-satellaview.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-874511" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.8816199376947" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:88.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/874511-satellaview.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-874511"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/874511-satellaview.jpg"></a><figcaption>The Satellaview and its box.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The Satellaview itself was a bulky add-on that snapped into the expansion port of the bottom of the Super Famicom. It was the first device to actually use the expansion port. A power transfer bracket was supplied which connected the Super Famicom to the BS-X to supply power so a separate adapter wasn't needed. An Satellaview-branded AV selector is also included with the package. The BS-X Cassette, the units storage device, could hold around 512kb of data. A deluxe package was available that included an 8Mbit memory pak, which was necessary for larger games or multiple game saves. The BS-X was the result of the failed SFC CD add-on. The CD add-on sparked interest in using the expansion port for something, but instead of a different storage medium, the developers created a digital distribution service in conjunction with the St. GIGA satellite radio station.</p><h2>Software</h2><p style="">Updates were only broadcast between 4PM and 7PM (JST) by St. GIGA satellite radio. These updates contained game news, new games, quizzes and some advertisements. Quizzes had high score lists on the network and highest scorers could receive prizes such as telephone cards or a memory pak. Most games were only available for a limited time, being released in parts over the course of an amount of days or weeks (usually 4). For example, a game might have 25% of the world map revealed in it's first week, with the full world map available by the end of the month. Games on the Satellaview are often exclusive to the platform and many have not been released anywhere else; this makes units with exclusive games on them especially valuable to collectors.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/874512-08e.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-874512" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-width="256" style="width: 256px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/874512-08e.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-874512"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/874512-08e.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/874512-08e.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>An example of a voice-acted scene that may appear.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Some games had a live, satellite streaming voice broadcast along with them, much like a radio drama and a coinciding real time in-game clock. <a href="/bs-zelda-no-densetsu-kodai-no-sekiban/3030-22297/" data-ref-id="3030-22297">Zelda no Densetsu Kodai no Sekiban</a> for example, had live voice acted cut scenes, as well as voice acted optional side quests. These could only be played at certain times and not saved to the BS-X Cassette. There is a thirteen-minute window during which a side quest character can be saved, and the voice would only play if the player was on the same screen. It is assumed that the voice actor simply repeated the cries for help for thirteen minutes and it was streamed if the player was "within earshot" in the game. Some games, such as the BS Zelda games were rebroadcast, but since the St. GIGA subscription ended in 2000, it is no longer possible to play these games in their original format.</p><p style="">Other than Satellaview-exclusive releases, there were also standard Super Famicom games broadcast, as well as vastly updated versions of popular games or "remixed" versions. There were a few original games for the device as well. Despite being a seemingly obscure add-on, the Satellaview garnered quite a bit of support, even getting third party releases from <a href="/square-co-ltd/3010-6323/" data-ref-id="3010-6323">Square</a> and <a href="/enix-corporation/3010-6337/" data-ref-id="3010-6337">Enix</a>.</p><h2>Notable Games</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/874515-1girl1.gif" data-ref-id="1300-874515" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.875" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-width="256" style="width: 256px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:87.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/874515-1girl1.gif" data-ref-id="1300-874515"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/874515-1girl1.gif" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/874515-1girl1.gif"></noscript></a><figcaption>BS Zelda no Densetsu</figcaption></figure><ul><li><a href="/bs-fire-emblem-akaneia-senki/3030-21372/" data-ref-id="3030-21372">BS Fire Emblem: Akaneia Senki</a></li><li><a href="/bs-super-mario-usa/3030-29969/" data-ref-id="3030-29969">BS Mario USA</a></li><li><a href="/bs-zelda-no-densetsu/3030-22245/" data-ref-id="3030-22245">BS Zelda no Densetsu</a></li><li><a href="/bs-zelda-no-densetsu-kodai-no-sekiban/3030-22297/" data-ref-id="3030-22297">BS Zelda no Densetsu Kodai no Sekiban</a></li><li><a href="/bs-f-zero-2-grand-prix/3030-21450/" data-ref-id="3030-21450">BS F-Zero 2 Grand Prix</a></li><li><a href="/mario-excite-bike/3030-22269/" data-ref-id="3030-22269">Mario Excite Bike</a></li><li><a href="/radical-dreamers-nusumenai-houseki/3030-11566/" data-ref-id="3030-11566">Radical Dreamers: Nusumenai Hōseki</a></li><li><a href="/warios-woods/3030-2582/" data-ref-id="3030-2582">Wario's Woods</a></li></ul><p style="">The four chapters of BS Fire Emblem: Akaneia Senki were later remade and included in <a href="/fire-emblem-shin-monshou-no-nazo-hikari-to-kage-no/3030-31423/" data-ref-id="3030-31423">Fire Emblem: Shin Monshou no Nazo</a> on the Nintendo DS as a bonus.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>History<br/></h2><a data-ref-id="3010-460" href="/mattel-electronics/3010-460/" slug="mattel-electronics">      Mattel</a> began manufacturing of the Aquarius in June of 1983, With the expectation that it would compete in the same market as <a data-ref-id="3010-2025" href="/texas-instruments/3010-2025/" slug="texas-instruments">     Texas Instruments</a>' <a data-ref-id="3045-48" href="/ti-994a/3045-48/" slug="ti-994a">    TI 99/4A</a>, the ZX-81 and <a data-ref-id="3045-16" href="/zx-spectrum/3045-16/" slug="zx-spectrum">   ZX Spectrum</a>, the Oric and the <a data-ref-id="3045-30" href="/vic-20/3045-30/" slug="vic-20">  VIC-20</a>.  The system was meant to create a hybrid between a home computer &amp; a game console. <br/><br/>Unfortunately the Aquarius was not successful and as a result the console sold very poorly (less than 20,000 worldwide). Production ended just 4 months later in October 1983. <br/><br/>The system as a computer had little to no built in memory so when using the cartridge "Fileform" (a word processor) the user would have to store their work often on tape or print it out on paper, Eventually releasing several RAM memory expansions, All of which were quite costly. Mattel admitted that they released the Aquarius at a loss with the expectation that they would earn a profit by selling the extension modules and cartridges that were used for each different program.<br/> <br/>As a console it fared no better. The graphics were comparable to that of the <a data-ref-id="3045-51" href="/intellivision/3045-51/" slug="intellivision"> Intellivision</a>, and used the exact same sound card as the Intellivision, which also had a far greater selection of games to choose from. <br/> <br/>Programmers jokingly used the line "Aquarius - system for the seventies!" <br/>  <br/><h2>Hardware<br/></h2>The Aquarius had several extension modules, Used to make gaming an easier more enjoyable experience, Though they were costly and did little to help create a market for the device.  <br/> <br/><h3>Mini Expander<br/></h3> Added an additional cartridge slot, Allowing a game cartridge and memory cartridge to be attached at the same time. Two additional audio channels, And 2 controllers similar in style to the Intellivision, But with less buttons. <br/> <br/><h3>Data recorder &amp; RAM carts<br/></h3> The data recorder was a cassette device used for storing information,  <br/> And the RAM carts were storage devices available in 4k &amp; 16k versions.<br/>   <br/><h3>Printer &amp; Modem<br/></h3>  The printer was a standard 40 column thermal printer,  <br/>  And the modem allowed 300bit/s upload &amp; download.<br/> <br/><h2>Technical Specifications </h2><ul class="plain-list"><li><b>OS:</b> Microsoft-Aquarius BASIC 1.0<br/></li><li><b>CPU:</b> Zilog Z80A @ 3.5 MHz</li><li><b>Memory:</b> 4K RAM; 8K ROM<br/></li><li><b>Display:</b> 40x24 (text), 80x72 (graphics), 16 colors</li><li><b>Storage:</b> cassette recorder<br/></li></ul>]]></description>

      <deck><![CDATA[The Nintendo 64 Disk Drive was an expansion for the Nintendo 64 allowing the use of magnetic disks that offered greater storage capacity and the ability to be written to.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">In 1995 Shoshinkai game show (Space world today) in <a href="/japan/3035-37/" data-ref-id="3035-37">Japan</a>, that <a href="/nintendo/3010-90/" data-ref-id="3010-90">Nintendo</a> first announced their plans to release the 64DD (Dynamic Drive) system. In 1997 <a href="/shigeru-miyamoto/3040-614/" data-ref-id="3040-614">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> gave more details about the systems abilities and forthcoming games, of which most were never released. The disc drive add-on connected to the <a href="/nintendo-64/3045-43/" data-ref-id="3045-43">Nintendo 64</a>’s EXT port located underneath the console. It wasn’t until 1999, towards the end of the N64’s production life, that 64DD add-on became available to the public. The 64DD was never available outside of Japan.</p><p style="">Unfortunately, Nintendo created the system using a technology that was all but defunct by the time of it‘s release. Offering an alternate format to the cartridge which utilized rewritable magnetic discs rather than the CD-ROM format of Nintendo’s main rivals. While the technology may have seemed fanciful to audiences outside of Japan, Nintendo already had experience utilizing disk drives with their systems (i.e. the <a href="/famicom-disk-system/3045-91/" data-ref-id="3045-91">Famicom Disk System</a>). The format also shared with cartridges the benefit of difficulty in pirating while alleviating the space constraints of traditional cartridges and the loading times endemic to the CD-ROM based systems of the time. However production costs for the magnetic discs used with the system remained higher than that off CD-ROM media and this had the effect of tempering 3rd party developer interest since the ubiquitous CD-ROM disk could be made for pennies and while offering even more space than was available via the technology offered in the 64DD.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3104/513949-64dd_box.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-513949" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.76142131979695" data-width="197" style="width: 197px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:76.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3104/513949-64dd_box.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-513949"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3104/513949-64dd_box.jpg"></a><figcaption>64DD Console Box.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Nintendo offered the 64DD through a mail order subscription service in Japan that cost subscribers ¥2,500 a month, for a 12 month contract. What they got for that price was the 64DD hardware unit, including a 4MB RAM expansion pack, a modem cartridge including the cables, software and access to the RAND net online service. Also games and additional software programs were to be shipped out to clients periodically</p><p style="">The magnetic disc had a storage capacity of 64MB and were a lot like Zip disc’s for PC‘s. The main advantage of using these discs is that they are encased in a tough shell, so they were a lot more durable than a CD and were a lot cheaper to manufacture than the N64 cartridge (still a lot more than the CD though), also load times were very quick, rarely exceeding five second loading times, with three or four seconds being the average speed for a game to load up. Along with the magnetic disc, the 64DD also had some interesting features that promised to revolutionize the gaming industry and Nintendo‘s N64 platform.</p><p style="">The system was obviously designed to play new and original 64DD game releases, and nine full 64DD games were actually released (four of which were different versions of Mario paint) for the system. But it wasn’t the new game releases that got video games players interested and intrigued with 64DD platform. It was the concept of the expansion kit disc’s, that provided further content for previously released Nintendo 64 games. The only expansion kit released that utilized the power of both systems was the F-Zero X Expansion Kit. With many others being proposed, but never released.</p><p style="">The 64DD’s online feature was made possible by Nintendo creating the RAND network, which was a little bit like satellite view for the Super Nintendo. Everything you needed to get the 64DD online was included in the starter pack on it’s release in late 1999. Part of this package was the Nexus developed internet modem that plugged into the N64’s cartridge slot. Once you were connected to internet you could take advantage of number of options, which included a web browser, access to a member’s only information page, an online message board for communicating with other 64DD users, the option of sending messages to the actual game programmers, beta testing, listening to music online (that was of a CD quality) and an online magazine that covered news, sports and weather. When it came to online gaming they had the choice, to either play against other people or simply observe others playing games or applications. The most popular feature on the RAND net, was it’s ability for users to share and swap what they had created using the Mario Artist creative programs with other 64DD subscribers.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3104/513962-nintendo_64dd_disk.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-513962" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.75853350189633" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3104/513962-nintendo_64dd_disk.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-513962"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3104/513962-nintendo_64dd_disk.jpg"></a><figcaption>64DD Magnetic Disc.</figcaption></figure><p style="">In February of 2001 the RAND net service was canceled. Even though it enjoyed moderate success, with a cult status in Japan, the somewhat limited user base just wasn’t enough to justify its continued existence as a platform. The service was offered for free after the cancellation date was announced by Nintendo up until the plug was finally pulled. Once the RAND net service was disabled, Nintendo began buying back all the related software and hardware, which would be useless with out the service, but all other DD hardware and software could be kept.</p><p style="">The 64DD add-on only managed to sell 15,000 units in Japan and was classified as a commercial failure for Nintendo. Often being compared to all the add-ons Sega piled onto the Genesis/Mega Drive (e.g. <a href="/sega-32x/3045-31/" data-ref-id="3045-31">Sega 32X</a>). Nintendo didn’t completely walk away from this empty handed though, and if anything the 64DD was more of an experiment giving them a chance to trial new ideas (online games and internet access), some of which became standard features in Nintendo's future products and consoles.</p><p style="">The 4MB RAM cartridge took on a new life of it’s own, being released to the rest of the world as an expansion pack for the N64 console and was bundled in with selected titles to help enhance the graphical performance of the system. The 64DD was an interesting concept for its time, which had massive potential, and maybe things would have turned out a lot differently if the system wasn’t delayed for such a long period of time and more support was given to the platform by 3rd party developers.</p><h2>Unreleased Titles</h2><p style="">Prior to it's fate as a comercial failure the 64DD had a variety of titles being worked on for it. The following is a list of games and their fate</p><p style="">* Dragon Warrior VII (released as a Playstation Title)</p><p style="">*<a href="//www.giantbomb.com/hybrid-heaven/3030-16990/" data-ref-id="3030-16990">Hybrid Heaven</a> (Eventually released as an N64 cartridge)</p><p style="">* <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/mission-impossible/3030-29369/" data-ref-id="3030-29369">Mission Impossible</a> (Eventually released as an N64 cartridge)</p><p style="">* <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/mother-3/3030-3864/" data-ref-id="3030-3864">Mother 3 </a>(released as a Game Boy Advance Title)</p><p style="">* <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/pokemon-snap/3030-10024/" data-ref-id="3030-10024">Pokemon Snap</a> (released on cartridge)</p><p style="">* Pokemon Stadium (Released on N64, Exclusively in Japan.)</p><p style="">*Pokemon Stadium 2 (Released on N64. Retitled as <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/pokemon-stadium/3025-1634/" data-ref-id="3025-1634">Pokemon Stadium</a> for North America)</p><p style="">* Super Mario 64 2 (Ultimately canceled after significant work was put into it as a Gamecube title. Some have speculated that <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/super-mario-galaxy/3030-16094/" data-ref-id="3030-16094">Mario Galaxy</a> was a direct result of such work)</p><p style="">* Super Mario RPG 2 (Released as <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/paper-mario/3030-19929/" data-ref-id="3030-19929">Paper Mario </a>on cartridge)</p><p style="">* <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/resident-evil-zero/3030-10247/" data-ref-id="3030-10247">Resident Evil 0</a> (Release on Gamecube)</p><p style="">* Ultra Donkey Kong (Released as <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/donkey-kong-64/3030-15000/" data-ref-id="3030-15000">Donkey Kong 64</a> on cartridge)</p><p style="">* Ura-Zelda (Split into two. with <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/3030-13594/" data-ref-id="3030-13594">Majora's Mask</a> being the "new game" released on cartridge and <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time-master-quest/3030-17278/" data-ref-id="3030-17278">Zelda: Master Quest</a> being the enchanted remake released on Gamecube)</p><p style="">*Zelda 64 (Released a <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/3030-12572/" data-ref-id="3030-12572">Ocarina of Time</a> on N64.)</p><p style="">In addition, add-ons for <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/quest-64/3030-4924/" data-ref-id="3030-4924">Quest 64 </a>and <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/automobili-lamborghini/3030-27569/" data-ref-id="3030-27569">Automobile Lamborghini </a>were also in the works Four additional Mario Artist titles were also planned.</p><p style=""> </p><p style=""> </p><h2>Collectibility</h2><p style="">Due to its extremely limited release only in Japan the system is highly sought after by collectors. The games usually sell for around $80-$100 but can also go for over $200. The system itself is much harder to come by and usually sells for $1000+ if in good condition with all inserts.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview<br/></h2>The Pippin was a computer entertainment platform developed by Apple Computers and manufactured by Bandai co. The Pippin was based on the hardware and software architecture of the second generation Power Macintosh. It was intended to not only be a video game console, but also a complete multimedia experience. It could play music CDs and other non-game software titles. It was meant to be an advanced multimedia PC that was easy to use and affordable for most households. Since most homes had a television set in the home already, Apple believed that people would be willing to invest in a low cost computer that connected to equipment that was already present in the home. The Pippin was made a platform that Apple made available to third party manufacturers under license, similar to the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer. The only manufacturers that made Pippins were Bandai in Japan and the United States, and Katz Media in Europe. The Pippin lasted only two years, and ceased production in 1997. It is widely regarded as a failure.<br/><br/> <h2>Software</h2>Only 18 titles were released for the Pippin in the United States, although Bandai released as many as 80 in Japan. All Pippin titles could be used on Macintosh computers of the time, although you could not use any Macintosh software on the Pippin without certain modifications. Through heavy modification, some DOS and Windows based programs could also be used on the Pippin.<br/><br/> <h2>Hardware</h2>The Pippin units released in Japan were white colored and were called ATMARK units. The Pippins released in the United States were black and were called @WORLD units. Both units were compatible with numerous accessories, including floppy disk drives and printers. Through two Apple Desktop Bus (ADB) ports, up to four controllers could be used simultaneously. With a special adapter standard ADB mice and keyboards could also be used. <br/><br/> <h3>System Specs</h3> <ul class="plain-list"> <li>66MHz PowerPC 603 RISC Microprocessor</li> <li>Superscaler, 3 instructions per clock cycle</li> <li>8 kByte data and 8 kByte instruction caches</li> <li>IEEE standard Single &amp; Double Precision Floating Point Unit</li> <li>6 MB combined System &amp; Video Memory</li> <li>4X CDROM drive</li> <li>64 kbyte SRAM Store/Restore Backup</li></ul> <ul class="plain-list"> <li>Easy memory expansion cards in 2, 4 and 8 MB increments</li></ul><br/> <h3>Audio</h3> <ul class="plain-list"> <li>Stereo 16 bit 44 kHz sampled output</li> <li>Stereo 16 bit 44 kHz sampled input</li> <li>Separate headphone output with dedicated volume control</li></ul><br/> <h3>Video</h3> <ul class="plain-list"> <li>8 bit and 16 bit video support</li> <li>Dual Frame Buffers</li> <li>Support for NTSC &amp; PAL composite, S-Video and VGA (640x480) monitors</li> <li>Up to 16.7M colors<br/></li></ul>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><br/>The Tiger R-Zone is in essence a consolized Tiger pocket game with interchangeable games.  Each cartridge has it's own LCD screen which the unit shines light through, which reflects off a mirror into the player's eye.  The actual unit provides only the controls and processing.  Three versions of the R-Zone were released from 1995 to 1997 and none of them enjoyed any market success.  Largely, games were only red and black with the exception of the Superscreen which has black LCD graphics on a special color background.  The R-Zone was not made to compete directly with any other systems on the market.  Sometimes it is said to have competed with the <a data-ref-id="3045-79" href="/virtual-boy/3045-79/" slug="virtual-boy">  Virtual Boy</a> due to both systems marketing virtual reality and having exclusively red games but this was not the original intention when the unit was first designed.<br/><br/><h2>Hardware</h2><h3><br/></h3><h3>R-Zone XPG</h3> Model: 71-331<br/> Batteries:  4 "AA" until late 1996 then 4 "AAA"<br/> CPU: ???<br/> Screen: LCD<br/>Audio: Mono<br/> Color: 2 (Red &amp; Black)<br/><br/><h3>R-Zone Head Gear</h3>Model: 71-212<br/>Batteries: 2 "AAA"<br/>CPU: ???<br/>Screen: Polycarbonite Screen<br/>Audio: Mono<br/>Color: 2 (Red &amp; Black) <br/><br/><h3>R-Zone Super Screen</h3># of Model: 71-???<br/>Batteries: 4 "C" <br/>CPU: ???<br/>Screen: Magnifying Lens Display<br/>Audio: Mono<br/>Color: 1 (Black)<br/><br/><h2>Models</h2><br/><h3>XPG: Xtreme Pocket Gear (1995)</h3>The XPG was Tiger's first iteration of the R-Zone and had a relatively standard design with a directional pad on the left of the screen and 4 buttons on the right.  The middle of the device simply bears the XPG logo, while the game is reflected onto a mirror that flips up off the top of the device.  It used 4 AAA batteries in 2 separate compartments on either end of the unit. The bulb used to light screen takes up so much room in the device that it is somewhat of a misnomer to be called "pocket." The name XPG was intended to be the systems proper name but the system is usually referred to simply as "R-Zone."<br/><br/><h3>Head Gear (1996)<br/></h3>The R-Zone Head Gear was Tiger's attempt at providing a <a data-ref-id="3015-421" href="/virtual-reality/3015-421/" slug="virtual-reality"> virtual reality</a> experience for the player.  It was marketed as such, but in reality, it only resembles virtual reality in cosmetic design. It plays simple LCD games via a mirror reflecting light through the game screen into one eyeball.  The controller was wired to the headset and provided the power with 4 AAA batteries. The controller has volume and brightness dials on the bottom, as well as a slot to store an extra game cartridge. The Head Gear is largely criticized for being almost exclusively cosmetic. The headset adds nothing to the gameplay experience and limits the viewable screen to one eye.<br/><br/><h3>Super Screen (1997)</h3>The R-Zone Super Screen was a table top version of the original R-Zone XPG. Tiger scrapped the virtual reality marketing campaign and tried to improve the LCD console as much as they could with the Super Screen.  The big changes are that the screen is much larger and magnified, the d-pad was scrapped in favor of 4 buttons and that a color filter could be placed over some games to give the backgrounds more color.  All movement on the screen is still black. Also, the screen is directly backlit so there is no more mirror; the major effect being that other players can see the game since it doesn't need to be viewed at a specific angle. One spare backlight was included with the console. The beastly device ran on 4 C batteries and can hardly be considered a handheld.]]></description>

      <deck><![CDATA[Mattel's HyperScan allowed players to scan in RFID-equipped cards to bring in new characters, weapons, and powers. It came packaged with X-Men, Spider-Man and Ben 10.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2>The <a data-ref-id="3010-460" href="/mattel-electronics/3010-460/">     Mattel</a> HyperScan is Mattel's only entry into the video game market besides the <a data-ref-id="3045-51" href="/intellivision/3045-51/">    Intellivision</a>. It is the first and only console to use Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. The console reads UDF-format CDs that contain a proprietary executable file with the game file. The idea of the HyperScan was to combine card collecting with video gaming and target an audience of younger children who are not ready for mainstream consoles. When scanned, cards will activate characters or power them up for the game currently being played.  Only five games were released for the HyperScan out of seven announced, and the system was discontinued by Mattel in 2008.<br /><br /><h2>Hardware</h2>The HyperScan's main feature is an RFID scanner that reads cards and writes data back to them.  It retailed for $69.99, with extra controllers for $19.99.  The system has a 4x CD-ROM drive and only supports composite video.  The 162MHz Sunplus nMedia processor is not very powerful, and the console only has a 2D graphics engine, so none of the five games released have any 3D graphics.  The graphics are frowned upon for being excessively choppy and sluggish, and the load times off of the CD-Rom drive are upwards of 20 seconds in games.  The system supports up to two players.  Each controller is a simple faux analog stick with 4 buttons which is not ergonomically designed at all.  The video in the games is compressed using MPEG4, and the audio using MP3.  Each character has only one line of low-quality spoken dialogue.<br /><br /><h3>Technical Specifications</h3><br /><em>CPU</em> - SCore (162 MHz Sunplus mMedia 32-bit RISC processor)<br /><em>Video</em> - Composite, 2D graphic engine, 640x480 resolution, MPEG4 codec<br /><em>Audio</em> - MP3 codec, 24 PCM sound channels<br /><em>Memory</em> - 16 MB SDRAM<br /><em>ODD </em>- 4x CD-Rom drive <u><br /></u><em>IO</em> - 1x USB 1.1 port, RFID Scanner<br /><em>RFID Scanner</em> - 13.56 MHz<br /><em>RFID Storage</em> - 110 bytes (96 bytes of user memory 8 bytes unique ID 6 bytes of one time programmable memory)<br /><br /><h2>Software</h2>The HyperScan had seven titles planned but only five were ever released. Games were mostly 2d fighters and platformers. An <a data-ref-id="3030-24897" href="/x-men/3030-24897/"> X-Men</a> 2d fighting game is included with the console and other licensed games available with characters from <a data-ref-id="3030-24894" href="/marvel-heroes/3030-24894/">   Marvel Heroes</a> and <a data-ref-id="3030-24896" href="/ben-10/3030-24896/">  Ben 10</a>.  Each game requires cards to work, which much be purchased separately for $14.99 per booster pack of 6 cards. Games retailed for $24.99 and included the game disc, a manual, and a booster pack. Avatar: The Last Airbender and Nickelodeon Sports were planned for the HyperScan, but never released.]]></description>

      <deck><![CDATA[The Game Wave Family Entertainment System is a simple DVD-based game platform from ZAPiT Games.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2>The <a data-ref-id="3010-6541" href="/zapit-games/3010-6541/" slug="zapit-games">          ZAPiT</a> Game Wave Family Entertainment System is a family-oriented video game console released October 2005 in <a data-ref-id="3035-244" href="/canada/3035-244/" slug="canada">         Canada</a>.  The console is meant to provide an alternative to traditional game consoles by being a console meant for family settings with a software library almost exclusively for non-gamers.  Game Wave uses up to six proprietary remote controls, which resemble TV remotes, to give non-gamer players a familiar tool to control the game with.  Most games are <a data-ref-id="3015-1100" href="/spin-off/3015-1100/" slug="spin-off">        spinoffs</a> of popular board games or trivia games.  Games are on DVD media and the limited control system means games must be must more straightforward than traditional games, so it is unlikely games such as action games or RPGs will ever be released on the Game Wave.  One of the main advertised features of the Game Wave is that six players can play simultaneously, so there is no waiting for turns such as in a board game.<br/><br/><h2>Hardware</h2>The Game Wave console doubles as a DVD player and comes standard with four wireless remotes for an MSRP of $99.  The console comes bundled with the game <a data-ref-id="3030-25009" href="/4-degrees-vol-1/3030-25009/" slug="4-degrees-vol-1">       4 Degrees: The Arc of Trivia, Vol. 1</a>.  Two extra controllers are available for $30.  The console itself supports either composite or S-Video output and recognizes up to 6 of the color-coded controllers.  On the side of the console are six slots that hold the controllers.  None of the controllers take precedence over any of the others, so any controller can control movies or game menus.  The system is not very powerful and graphics are colorful, but often simple 2D mixed with text.<br/><br/>In the Bilmar Station Sports Tavern of Tampa, FL there is a prototype coin-op Game Wave system.  It's a 4-player arcade game that has all of the Game Wave games built in, as well as others such as Texas Hold 'Em.  The game is a redemption game but players are <em>not </em>rewarded with tickets individually.  Presumably the winner of the game gets the tickets.<br/><br/><h2>Software</h2>Game Wave software is largely based around trivia, word games, and simple board games, as the console is not powerful enough, nor does the control scheme lend itself to more complex games.  Being marketed as a family console, every game supports multiplayer for six players.  Every game is also developed and published by <a data-ref-id="3010-6541" href="/zapit-games/3010-6541/" slug="zapit-games"> ZAPiT Games</a> and carries an MSRP of $24.99.  The Game Wave currently has variations of <a data-ref-id="3030-1071" href="/boggle/3030-1071/" slug="boggle">      Boggle</a>, <a data-ref-id="3030-18531" href="/yahtzee/3030-18531/" slug="yahtzee">     Yahtzee</a>, <a data-ref-id="3030-677" href="/hangman/3030-677/" slug="hangman">    Hangman</a>, <a data-ref-id="3030-23773" href="/blackjack/3030-23773/" slug="blackjack">   Blackjack</a>, Sudoku, and <a data-ref-id="3030-3279" href="/scrabble/3030-3279/" slug="scrabble">  Scrabble</a>.  There are also six various trivia games, three of which are based on recent history.  Each trivia game claims to offer up to 25 hours of play without repeat questions.  New software from ZAPiT games does not appear likely.]]></description>

Products will be priced at 0, 200, 500 and 800 points.<br/><br/>Nintendo is planning on have a weekly downloads. New titles or applications will be released every Monday.]]></description>

      <deck><![CDATA[The RDI Halcyon was a short-lived laserdisc-based game platform. Only two games were properly released for the system.  It was the most expensive video game console ever released, retailing at $2,500.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Building upon the success of his laserdisc games Dragon's Lair and Space Ace, <a href="/rick-dyer/3040-47901/" data-ref-id="3040-47901">Rick Dyer</a>, head of <a href="/rdi-video-systems/3010-6663/" data-ref-id="3010-6663">RDI Video Systems</a> led the development of the Halcyon. One of the notable features of the console was its use of a speech recognition processor and a Votrax speech synthesizer, allowing the machine to talk to the player. Dyer claimed that these features made the Halcyon not just a video game console, but something like a "living entity" that he compared to the HAL-9000 computer from <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i>. This voice system was said to take the controls "out of your hands and into your mouth."</p><p style="">As development continued, investors and manufacturers grew skeptical that the public would embrace a system with a high price tag of $2500. This high cost was in part due to its dependence on laserdisc media. The Halcyon never went into full production, and only a few handmade units were given to investors.</p><p style="">Although several games were in production, only two games were technically said to have been released for the system: <a href="/thayers-quest/3030-26100/" data-ref-id="3030-26100">Thayer's Quest</a> and a version of NFL Football called "NFL Football LA Raiders vs SD Chargers." Unreleased games included a live action FMV horror game called The Spirit of Whittier Mansion, a space adventure Shadow of the Stars, and a game titled Orpheus centered around Greek mythology. The latter two used hand-drawn animation in the style of Thayer's Quest.</p>]]></description>

      <deck><![CDATA[A proprietary 32-bit computer from Fujitsu, released in 1989 only in Japan. The first computer with a standard CD-ROM drive, it had many CD enhanced versions of Eastern and Western games (including action, adventure and RPG titles) which are sought after to this day by collectors. Its console version, FM Towns Marty, released in 1993 as the first 5th-gen console.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<p style="">FM Towns is a proprietary 32-bit computer system manufactured by <a href="/fujitsu/3010-6596/" data-ref-id="3010-6596">Fujitsu</a>. It was released in <a href="/japan/3035-37/" data-ref-id="3035-37">Japan</a> only, in February 1989, as the successor to the <a href="/fm-7/3045-114/" data-ref-id="3045-114">FM-7</a> computer platform. The FM Towns had a launch price of ¥400,000 (over $3000 in 1989 dollars, equivalent to nearly $6000 in 2013 dollars). While it was never officially released outside Japan, imports of the FM Towns were available, particularly in the <a href="/united-kingdom/3035-492/" data-ref-id="3035-492">UK</a>. When it first released, the FM Towns was one of the most advanced <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC</a> platforms released up until then, rivalled only by the <a href="/sharp-x68000/3045-95/" data-ref-id="3045-95">Sharp X68000</a>.</p><h2>Overview</h2><p style="">FM Towns was considerably advanced for its time. At launch in 1989, it was using a 32-bit Intel 80386DX CPU (later upgraded to Pentium CPU in early 90's), supported 24-bit colour which could display up to 16.78 million colours, featured high-resolution display modes up to 1024x1024 pixels, and featured the unique ability to overlay two different display modes.</p><p style="">It has a built in <a href="/compact-disc/3055-2133/" data-ref-id="3055-2133">CD-ROM</a> drive as standard, which was many years ahead of its time. Also ahead of its time was its ability to boot directly to a CD version of its operating system, TownsOS. This was a full 8 years before Microsoft thought of doing the same thing. As well as being able to run the TownsOS graphical user interface, it had versions of Windows 3, 3.1 and Windows 95 as they became available.</p><p style="">Games were a strong point of the system as they could be greatly enhanced by the startlingly increased capacity of CDs over floppy discs.</p><p style="">Games were usually enhanced in one or more of the following ways:</p><ul><li>Near <a href="/arcade/3045-84/" data-ref-id="3045-84">arcade</a>-quality ports, instead of inferior conversions on other home systems (with the exception of the <a href="/sharp-x68000/3045-95/" data-ref-id="3045-95">Sharp X68000</a> computer and <a href="/neo-geo/3045-25/" data-ref-id="3045-25">Neo Geo</a> console). At release, it was a very powerful system.</li><li>Containing <a href="/voice-acting/3015-1413/" data-ref-id="3015-1413">voiced</a> speech and <a href="/full-motion-video/3015-604/" data-ref-id="3015-604">full-motion video</a> <a href="/cutscene/3015-22/" data-ref-id="3015-22">cutscenes</a>, which was almost impossible on floppy and cartridge based systems.</li><li>'<a href="/redbook-audio/3015-6487/" data-ref-id="3015-6487">Redbook</a>' CD music <a href="/original-soundtrack-release/3015-189/" data-ref-id="3015-189">soundtracks</a>, i.e. proper, non synthesised music that you can play on any CD player.</li></ul><p style="">As the system grew older, while IBM-compatible <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC</a>'s caught up, the versions of games became identical. For example, <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/wing-commander/3025-212/" data-ref-id="3025-212">Wing Commander Origins</a> in 1993 was identical on PC and FM Towns. Considering the system had been out for 4 years, that was impressive.</p><p style="">In the Western world, the system is perhaps best known for having many CD enhanced ports or <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/remake/3015-340/" data-ref-id="3015-340">remakes</a> (with improved graphics, audio, and interface) of classic Western RPG's and adventure games, such as the <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/ultima/3025-247/" data-ref-id="3025-247">Ultima </a>series and <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/lucasarts-entertainment-company-llc/3010-644/" data-ref-id="3010-644">LucasArts</a> games, for example. The FM Towns versions are sometimes considered the best versions of these games.</p><h2>Technical specifications</h2><h3>Main processors</h3><ul><li>Main CPU: <ul><li>1989: Intel 80386DX (32-bit) @ 16 MHz</li><li>1993: Intel i486DX @ 33-66 MHz / Intel i486SX @ 25 MHz</li><li>1994: Intel i486DX @ 33-66 MHz / Intel i486SX @ 33 MHz</li><li>1995: Intel Pentium @ 90-120 MHz</li></ul></li><li>Upgradable CPU: <ul><li>1993: Intel OverDrive @ 66-100 MHz</li><li>1994: Intel Pentium @ 75-120 MHz / 486DX4 @ 75-100 MHz</li><li>1995: Intel Pentium @ 120-133 MHz</li><li>1996: Intel Pentium @ 133-200 MHz</li></ul></li><li>FPU (floating point unit) arithmetic co-processor: Intel 80387 @ 16 MHz</li></ul><h3>Operating systems</h3><ul><li>Default: Towns OS (1989), Towns OS 2.1 (1995)</li><li>Supported: DOS/V (1990), Windows 3.1 (1992), Windows 95 (1995)</li></ul><h3>Memory</h3><ul><li>Main RAM (Random Access Memory) <ul><li>Default: 1-2 MB (1989), 4 MB (1993), 6 MB (1994), 8-16 MB (1995)</li><li>Upgradable: 10 MB (1989), 64 MB (1993), 128 MB (1995)</li></ul></li><li>Video RAM (VRAM) memory: 656 KB <ul><li>Main VRAM: 512 KB</li><li>Sprite RAM: 128 KB (1024 sprites)</li><li>Text RAM: 16 KB</li></ul></li><li>Storage: CD-ROM (540 MB), 2x 3.5" floppy disk (1.2 MB) drives, hard disk drive <ul><li>Optional storage: 5.25" floppy disk drive, hard disk drive</li></ul></li><li>CD-ROM drive speed: 1x (1989), 2x (1993), 4x (1995)</li><li>Hard disk drive: <ul><li>Default: 20-40 MB (1989), 170-340 MB (1993), 850 MB (1995)</li><li>Upgradable: 45 MB (1989), 3.2 GB (1997)</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Display</h3><ul><li>Display resolutions: 256x256, 320x240, 352x232, 360x240, 640x400, 640x480, 1024x768, 1024x1024, 1120x750</li><li>Colour palette: <ul><li>12-bit (4096 colours) @ 640x480 / 640x400 (2 planes)</li><li>15-bit (32,768 colours) @ 320x240 (2 planes)</li><li>24-bit (16.78 million colours) @ 640x480 (1 plane)</li></ul></li><li>Simultaneous colours: <ul><li>1989: <ul><li>4-bit (16 colours) @ 1024x1024 / 1120x750 (1 plane)</li><li>4-bit (16 colours) @ 640x480 / 640x400 (2 planes)</li><li>8-bit (256 colours) @ 640x480 (1 plane)</li><li>15-bit (32,768 colours) @ 320x240 (1 plane)</li></ul></li><li>1994: 15-bit (32,768 colours) to 24-bit (16.78 million colours)</li></ul></li><li>Sprites: Up to 1024 sprites @ 16x16 pixels each</li></ul><h3>Audio</h3><ul><li>CD audio: 16-bit sampling @ 44.1 KHz, <a href="/redbook-audio/3015-6487/" data-ref-id="3015-6487">Redbook</a> audio</li><li>FM synthesis audio: Yamaha YM2612 sound chip, 6-channel stereo</li><li>PCM audio: <ul><li>1989: Ricoh RF5c68 sound chip, 8-channel stereo, 8-bit sampling @ 19.2 Hz</li><li>1994: 16-bit sampling @ 48 KHz, stereo</li></ul></li><li>Optional sound card: Creative Sound Blaster AWE32 (1994)</li></ul><h3>Other specifications</h3><ul><li>Input: Keyboard, mouse, gamepad, joystick</li><li>Other options: Video card, microphone, <a href="/online/3015-559/" data-ref-id="3015-559">modem</a>, SCSI card, VGA card, <a href="/multi-monitor-support/3015-6433/" data-ref-id="3015-6433">dual-monitor support</a></li></ul><h2>History</h2><p style="">The FM Towns' main 16/32-bit rivals in the Japanese computer market were <a href="/nec-home-electronics-ltd/3010-2708/" data-ref-id="3010-2708">NEC</a>'s <a href="/nec-pc-9801/3045-112/" data-ref-id="3045-112">PC-98</a> (launched 1982) and <a href="/sharp-corporation/3010-6509/" data-ref-id="3010-6509">Sharp</a>'s <a href="/sharp-x68000/3045-95/" data-ref-id="3045-95">X68000</a> (launched 1987). The FM Towns had the best audio quality and multimedia capabilities upon release, and was second only to the X68000 in terms of power and graphical capabilities.</p><p style="">Despite this, the NEC PC-98 remained the market leader in Japan up until the mid-1990s, when the arrival of Windows 95 on <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">IBM-compatible PC</a>'s slowly began gaining rivalling the local Japanese competition around the late 1990s. Despite FM Towns supporting Windows 95, IBM-compatible PC's slowly came to dominate the Japanese computer market by the early 2000s. The mid-1990s is thus often seen as the end of the 'Golden Age' of Japanese computer gaming.</p><p style="">In 1993, Fujitsu released the a console version of the FM Towns called the FM Towns Marty, the first 32-bit console, beginning the fifth-generation of consoles in Japan a year before the launch of <a href="/sega/3010-62/" data-ref-id="3010-62">Sega</a>'s <a href="/saturn/3045-42/" data-ref-id="3045-42">Saturn </a>and <a href="/sony-computer-entertainment-incorporated/3010-995/" data-ref-id="3010-995">Sony</a>'s <a href="/playstation/3045-22/" data-ref-id="3045-22">PlayStation</a>. A variant called the FM Towns Marty 2 was released the following year in 1994 that featured a darker grey shell and a lower price point but was otherwise the same as the original FM Towns Marty. The FM Towns Marty was also backwards compatible with FM Towns games.  </p><h2>External link</h2><ul><li><a href="http://archive.org/stream/ace-magazine-27/ACE_Issue_27_1989_Dec#page/n27/mode/2up/" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">ACE Magazine, Issue 27, article on FM Towns</a></li><li><a href="http://museum.ipsj.or.jp/en/computer/personal/index.html" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">IPSJ Computer Museum</a></li><li><a href="http://www.old-computers.com/museum/doc.asp?c=968" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">Old Computers article</a></li></ul><p style=""> </p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p style="">The BBC Micro was a microcomputer platform, first introduced in 1981, with Acorn Computers winning the contract for the BBC's Computer Literacy Project ahead of <a href="/sinclair-research-ltd/3010-938/" data-ref-id="3010-938">Sir Clive Sinclair</a> and the ZX Spectrum. It was a way for Acorn to quickly make money thanks to the BBC name. Initially code-named "Proton" it became a great success in the UK, with every secondary school and primary school soon having access to one. At the time, the success of the BBC Micro made the UK the most computer-literate country in the world. Two revisions were released in November, 1981 the entry-level Model A at £235 and standard Model B at £335. Model B's included additional RAM a second processor. Later the BBC Master was released with more RAM and OS enhancements. The BBC B+ was released in 1984 which featured double the RAM found in the BBC B.</p><p style="">The BBC Micro is powered by a 6502 processor, the same one found in the Commodore PET and VIC-20 as well as the Atari 400 and 800.</p><p style="">Perhaps the best remembered game for the system was <a href="/acorn-software-products-inc/3010-4956/" data-ref-id="3010-4956">Acornsoft</a>'s <a href="/elite/3030-10902/" data-ref-id="3030-10902">Elite</a>, the first fully 3D space trading and combat game.

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Gaming</h2><p style="">PLATO's plasma panels were well suited for gaming even though the bandwidth was rather low. And using the communication features it was also possible for the games to go online. Many popular MMOs were developed during the 1970s and 80s such as <a data-ref-id="3030-29797" href="/empire/3030-29797/" slug="empire">Empire</a>, <a data-ref-id="3030-28154" href="/airfight/3030-28154/" slug="airfight">Airfight</a>, <a data-ref-id="3030-17598" href="/panther/3030-17598/" slug="panther">Panther</a>, the original <a data-ref-id="3030-32316" href="/freecell/3030-32316/" slug="freecell">Freecell</a>, and several games inspired by <a data-ref-id="3025-167" href="/dungeons-dragons/3025-167/" slug="dungeons-dragons">Dungeons and Dragons</a>. First person shooters like <a data-ref-id="3030-7326" href="/doom/3030-7326/" slug="doom">Doom</a> and <a data-ref-id="3030-8015" href="/quake/3030-8015/" slug="quake">Quake</a> made their appearance on the PLATO systems. Avatar was PLATO's most popular game and was the world's first MUD and has over a million hours of use.</p><h2>PLATO Online</h2><p style="">Although mainly designed for educational purposes the most enduring legacy of the PLATO systems was the online community created by its communication features. PLATO Notes was one of the world's first online message board and by 1976 PLATO had spawned a variety of tools for online communication, including email, chat rooms, instant messaging, remote screen sharing, and emoticons.</p>]]></description>

      <deck><![CDATA[A 16/32-bit Japanese personal computer system launched by NEC in 1982. It was the most successful computer platform in Japan and one of the best-selling computer systems of the 20th century. It has a very large video game library with thousands of titles, the majority of which were never released outside Japan.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">PC-98 is a series of 16/32-bit Japanese <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">personal computers</a>, designed by <a href="/nec-home-electronics-ltd/3010-2708/" data-ref-id="3010-2708">NEC</a>, but also licensed to other companies. In contrast to its <a href="/nec-pc-8801/3045-109/" data-ref-id="3045-109">PC-88</a> predecessor, the PC-98 was initially created as a business machine, but over time it eventually became popular with game developers. The PC-98 is based around Intel 8086 and compatible processors, but the design is proprietary, and it is not compatible with the <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">IBM PC</a> or clones, although versions of DOS and Windows were ported to it.</p><p style="">The system has a very large library of video games, consisting of more than 4,000 commercial titles and countless more <a href="/indie/3015-2911/" data-ref-id="3015-2911">doujin</a> (<a href="/indie/3015-2911/" data-ref-id="3015-2911">indie</a>) titles. The games and system are difficult to find outside of Japan, even on eBay. There are a few sites however that sell the games and systems.</p><h2>History</h2><p style="">When the PC-98 was launched in 1982, it was initially priced at ¥298,000 (about $1400 in 1982 dollars, equivalent to about $3400 in 2012 dollars). The PC-98 computer platform eventually went on to sell more than 18 million units in <a href="/japan/3035-37/" data-ref-id="3035-37">Japan</a> by 1999, surpassing the <a href="/commodore-64/3045-14/" data-ref-id="3045-14">Commodore 64</a> (17 million units) as the best-selling home computer system of the 20th century.</p><p style=""><a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">Laptop</a> versions of the PC-9801 were also being sold in the late 1980s. The first was the PC-98 LT, one of the first mass-market laptops, released in 1986. It is considered the world's first major <a href="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/399405/features/history-lesson-turbografx-pc-engine/" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">laptop PC</a>. The world's first notebook computer was released in 1989, NEC's UltraLite. By 1990, the 32-bit PC-9801 NC model became the world's first laptop/notebook computer with a colour TFT LCD display.</p><h3>NEC APC and rivalry with IBM PC overseas</h3><p style="">In the early 1980's, the PC-9801 was more advanced than Western computer platforms. The PC-98 featured the first dedicated computer GPU chip, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEC_%C2%B5PD7220" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">NEC 7220 GDC</a>, along with a 16-bit NEC CPU. It featured higher VGA display resolutions (initially up to 640x475 pixels, then up to 1024x1024 in 1983, and then up to 1120x750 pixels by 1985) in order to more accurately display Japanese text, a wider <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_C8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA33" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">color palette</a> (16 colors displayed out of a 4096 color palette), Yamaha <a href="/chiptune/3015-3745/" data-ref-id="3015-3745">FM synthesis</a> sound chips for higher-quality audio, and a modem for <a href="/online/3015-559/" data-ref-id="3015-559">online</a> internet access.</p><p style="">NEC attempted to introduce the NEC PC-9801 in <a href="/north-america/3035-1664/" data-ref-id="3035-1664">North America</a>, where it was re-branded as the NEC APC in 1982. NEC, the largest semiconductor company of the 1980s, marketed the APC III as the most powerful computer on the market and more reliable machine than leading competitor <a href="/ibm/3010-190/" data-ref-id="3010-190">IBM</a>'s <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC </a>platform, with the APC III offering twice as much speed (8 MHz), storage (720 KB floppy disks) and resolution (640x400 pixels) at around the same price. Despite the superior hardware compared to its competitors, the APC III eventually failed to make in impact in North America, largely due to the rise of IBM PC clones, which also negatively impacted IBM's share of the North American PC market.</p><p style="">While the NEC APC was unsuccessful in North America, it became successful in the <a href="/asia/3035-1663/" data-ref-id="3035-1663">Asia</a>-Pacific region, <a href="http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=333" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">particularly</a> in <a href="/australia/3035-292/" data-ref-id="3035-292">Australia</a>.</p><h3>Rivalry with Sharp X68000 and FM Towns in Japan</h3><p style="">The PC-98 was later technically surpassed by fellow Japanese rivals <a href="/sharp-corporation/3010-6509/" data-ref-id="3010-6509">Sharp</a> and <a href="/fujitsu/3010-6596/" data-ref-id="3010-6596">Fujitsu </a>when they launched their own more powerful 16/32-bit computers, the <a href="/sharp-x68000/3045-95/" data-ref-id="3045-95">Sharp X68000</a> and <a href="/fm-towns/3045-108/" data-ref-id="3045-108">FM Towns</a>, in 1987 and 1989, respectively.</p><p style="">In response, the PC-98 began using 32-bit Intel CPU processors from 1987 and supported the CD-ROM format from 1989. While both rival computers were capable of more advanced, <a href="/arcade/3045-84/" data-ref-id="3045-84">arcade</a> quality graphics (especially in the X68000's case) and/or greater multimedia features (in the FM Towns' case), neither computer platform was able to dethrone the PC-98 as the Japanese computer market leader.</p><h3>3D graphics cards and rivaly with IBM-compatible PC's in Japan</h3><p style="">Just as <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">IBM-compatible PC's</a> were on the rise in the mid-1990s, <a href="/nec-home-electronics-ltd/3010-2708/" data-ref-id="3010-2708">NEC </a>came back by releasing the first <a href="/polygonal-3d/3015-1430/" data-ref-id="3015-1430">3D graphics</a> accelerator cards on the market, initially for the PC-98. In 1995, NEC released the first 3D graphics card, the PC-FXGA (PC-FX Game Accelerator), exclusively for the PC-98. This allowed the PC-98 to produce the most advanced <a href="/polygonal-3d/3015-1430/" data-ref-id="3015-1430">3D graphics</a> seen on a home system up until that time, with a polygon rendering performance surpassing the <a href="/playstation/3045-22/" data-ref-id="3045-22">PlayStation</a> console and even rivaling the then upcoming <a href="/nintendo-64/3045-43/" data-ref-id="3045-43">Nintendo 64</a>; in contrast, rival early 1996 3D graphics accelerators for IBM PC clones, such as Creative Labs' 3D Blaster and <a href="/nvidia-corporation/3010-6345/" data-ref-id="3010-6345">NVIDIA</a>'s NV1, were unable to rival the PlayStation's 3D graphics. The PC-FXGA was originally intended for both the PC-98 computer and the <a href="/pc-fx/3045-75/" data-ref-id="3045-75">PC-FX</a> console, with as a <a href="/homebrew/3015-4363/" data-ref-id="3015-4363">homebrew </a>development kit for the <a href="/pc-fx/3045-75/" data-ref-id="3045-75">PC-FX</a> console, allowing the PC-98 to play PC-FX games. However, the PC-FX console lacked the 3D graphical capabilities of the PC-FXGA card, due to the FXGA's HuC6273 graphics chip (originally intended for the PC-FX) never actually being used by the PC-FX console.</p><p style="">The PC-FXGA was the most powerful 3D graphics card on the market up until it was surpassed by NEC's successor, the PowerVR, in early 1996. Unlike the PC-FXGA, the succeeding PowerVR was no longer exclusive to the PC-98, but supported both the PC-98 and IBM-compatible PC's. The PowerVR was able to produce near <a href="/arcade/3045-84/" data-ref-id="3045-84">arcade</a> quality 3D graphics, demonstrated by a near arcade quality port of <a href="/namco/3010-7420/" data-ref-id="3010-7420">Namco</a>'s <a href="/rave-racer/3030-23244/" data-ref-id="3030-23244">Rave Racer</a>, though this PowerVR port was later cancelled. The PowerVR would not be rivaled until the arrival of the 3dfx Voodoo graphics card for IBM-compatible PC's in late 1996. Though both the PowerVR and Voodoo were more or less evenly matched when it came to 3D capabilities, it was the Voodoo that became the most popular graphics card line-up of the late 1990s, due to the PowerVR's lack of third-party software support. Besides the PowerVR, the PC-98 very few other 3D graphics cards supported the PC-98.</p><h3>Decline</h3><p style="">The PC-98 would continue to dominate the Japanese computer market until the late 1990s, when the arrival of <a href="/microsoft-studios/3010-340/" data-ref-id="3010-340">Microsoft </a>Windows 95 made it possible for <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">IBM-compatible PC's</a> to accurately output Japanese text, leading to the rise of IBM-compatible PC's in Japan and marking the end of the 'Golden Age' of Japanese computer gaming.</p><p style="">By the end of the 1990s, the PC-98's dwindling market share as well as NEC's greater support for the growing IBM PC market eventually led to the PC-98 slowly losing ground to IBM-compatible PC's. In 1997, the PC-98 NX became one of the first computer platforms produced in line with the PC97 System Design Guide standard, which would later become the worldwide standard for IBM-compatible PC's. As a result, PC-98 standards eventually merged with IBM-compatible PC standards, bringing an end to the traditional PC-98 platform by the early 2000s, succeeded by IBM-compatible PC-98 NX computers which are still manufactured through to the present day.</p><h2>Technical specifications</h2><h3><strong>Main processors</strong></h3><p style=""><strong>Main CPU (Central Processing Unit)

Fujitsu were also later responsible for the <a href="/fm-towns/3045-108/" data-ref-id="3045-108">FM Towns</a>, the powerful 32-bit successor to the FM-7.</p><p style="">The FM-7 was similar to Radio Shack's <a href="/trs-80-coco/3045-68/" data-ref-id="3045-68">TRS-80 Color Computer</a> (colloquially referred to as the "CoCo") in some ways, especially CPU processor (both used the 8-bit Motorola 6809) and included features. One such feature is F-BASIC, very similar to the CoCo's "<a href="/microsoft-studios/3010-340/" data-ref-id="3010-340">Microsoft</a> CoCo BASIC." F-BASIC is essentially a simplistic programming language, including a katakana and kanji character set, graphics manipulation, and music.</p><h2>Model Variants</h2><p style="">There were several different versions of the FM-7 released following the initial release in 1982, including the FM-New 7 and FM-77.</p><p style="">A major breakthrough for computer gaming came in 1985, with the release of the FM-77 AV, the first computer model to break the 8-color barrier of 8-bit computers and achieve a simultaneous display of 4096 colors. In addition, the FM-77 AV also came with a built-in Yamaha FM synthesis sound board, providing higher-quality audio.</p><p style="">FM-7 models included:</p><ul><li><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/2115658-fujitsu_77av3c_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2115658" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.99551569506726" data-width="223" style="width: 223px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:99.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/2115658-fujitsu_77av3c_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2115658"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/2115658-fujitsu_77av3c_1.jpg"></a><figcaption>FM-77 AV</figcaption></figure> FM-New 7 (1984)</li><li>FM-77 (1984)</li><li>FM-77 L2 (1985)</li><li>FM-77 L4 (1985)</li><li>FM-77 AV (1985)</li><li>FM-77 AV20 (1986)</li><li>FM-77 AV40 (1986)</li><li>FM-77 AV20 EX (1987)</li><li>FM-77 AV40 EX (1987)</li><li>FM-77 AV40 SX (1988)</li></ul><h2>Technical Specifications</h2><h3>Processors</h3><ul><li><b>Main CPU (Central Processing Unit) processor</b>: <ul><li>1982: Fujitsu MBL 68B09 (based on 8-bit Motorola 68B09) @ 4.9 - 8 MHz</li><li>1984: Fujitsu MBL 68B09 (based on 8-bit Motorola 68B09) @ 8 MHz</li><li>1985: Fujitsu MBL 68B09E (8-bit) @ 2 MHz (equivalent to MBL 68B09 @ 8 MHz)</li></ul></li><li><strong>GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) processor</strong>: <ul><li>1982: Fujitsu MBL 68B09 (based on 8-bit Motorola 68B09) @ 2 MHz</li><li>1984: Fujitsu MBL 68B09E (8-bit) @ 2 MHz</li><li>1985: Fujitsu MMR (Memory Mapping Register), Fujitsu MBL 68B09E (8-bit) @ 2 MHz</li></ul></li><li><strong>Optional CPU processor</strong>: Zilog Z80 (8-bit)</li></ul><h3>Memory</h3><ul><li><strong>Main RAM (Random Access Memory)</strong><ul><li>1982: 64 KB</li><li>1984: 64-256 KB</li><li>1985: 128-256 KB</li><li>1986: 128 KB / 192 KB / 448 KB</li></ul></li><li><strong>Video RAM (VRAM) memory</strong>: <ul><li>1982: 48 KB</li><li>1985: 96 KB</li><li>1986: 96-144 KB</li><li>1987: 96-192 KB</li><li>1988: 192 KB</li></ul></li><li><strong><b>ROM (Read-Only Memory) memory</b></strong>: 48 KB (1982), 72 KB (1985)</li><li><strong>Storage</strong>: <ul><li>Default: 10-20 MB hard disk drive (1982), 1x-2x 3.5" DD floppy disk drives (1984)</li><li>Optional: Cassette tape, 5.25" floppy disk</li><li>3.5" DD (double-density) floppy disks: 320 KB each (1984), 640 KB each (1986)</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Display</h3><ul><li><b>Maximum display resolution</b>: 640x200 pixels (1982), 640x400 pixels (1984)</li><li><b><strong>Maximum color palette</strong></b>: 8 (1982), 16 (1984), 4096 (1985), 262,144 (1986)</li><li><b>Simultaneous display colors</b>: <ul><li>1982: 3 colors (monochrome), 8 colors (4-bit color)</li><li>1984: 8 colors at 640x200, 2 colors at 640x400</li><li>1985: 4096 colors at 320x200, 16 colors at 640x200, 2 colors at 640x400</li><li>1986: 4096 colors at 320x200, 16 colors at 640x200, 8 colors at 640x400</li><li>1987: 4096 colors at 320x200, 32 colors at 640x200, 16 colors at 640x400</li></ul></li><li><strong>Monitors</strong>: <a href="/multi-monitor-support/3015-6433/" data-ref-id="3015-6433">Multi-monitor support</a> for 2-6 monitors (1985)</li><li><strong>Video digitization</strong>: Supported (1985), Standard (1988)</li></ul><h3>Sound</h3><ul><li>1982: General Instruments AY-3-8910 sound chip (PSG synthesizer, 3 channels, 8 octaves)</li><li>1985: Yamaha sound board (FM synthesis, 3 channels), AY-3-8910 sound chip</li></ul><h3>Interface</h3><ul><li><b>Interface</b>: Tape, RGB, RS232, Joystick (2), ROM/RAM cartridges, BUS</li></ul><h2>External link</h2><ul><li><a href="http://museum.ipsj.or.jp/en/computer/personal/0017.html" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">IPSJ Computer Museum article on FM-77 AV</a></li></ul>]]></description>
