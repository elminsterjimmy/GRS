Rock Band 2 ships with 84 on-disc songs, 20 free downloadable songs, compatibility with all DLC, and the ability to import most songs from the first Rock Band.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Following the huge success of the first <i>Rock Band</i>, <a data-ref-id="3010-648" href="/harmonix-music-systems-inc/3010-648/" slug="harmonix-music-systems-inc">Harmonix</a> began work on <i>Rock Band 2</i>, along with publisher <a data-ref-id="3010-4368" href="/mtv-games/3010-4368/" slug="mtv-games">MTV Games</a> and distributor <a data-ref-id="3010-1" href="/electronic-arts/3010-1/" slug="electronic-arts">EA</a>. It was released as a stand-alone game (i.e. not bundled with instruments) on September 14th, 2008 for the Xbox 360 in North America. The PlayStation 3 version was released as both a stand-alone game as well as bundled with the new instruments on October 19th, 2008, as well as the Xbox 360 bundle, containing the game disc, guitar, drum kit and microphone. The PlayStation 2 and Wii versions were released at later dates.</p><p style="">Naturally, <i>Rock Band 2</i> features full band gameplay similar to that of its predecessor, allowing up to four players of different instruments to play together as a band. <i>Rock Band 2</i> shipped with the largest on-disc setlist for a <i>Rock Band</i> or <a data-ref-id="3025-289" href="/guitar-hero/3025-289/" slug="guitar-hero">Guitar Hero</a> game yet, featuring 84 songs, all of which were master recordings. Some notable inclusions on the set list include AC/DC's first song in a rhythm game with "Let There Be Rock" and Guns N' Roses "Shackler's Revenge," off their newest album <i>Chinese Democracy.</i> Purchasing the disc also grants buyers a voucher that allows them to download twenty free songs, with no additional charge.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">Basic gameplay remains the same as the original <i>Rock Band</i> title; players play solo or as a band in order to complete songs and get high scores by hitting notes and singing in pitch to the tune of rock songs of all years and genres. <i>Rock Band 2</i>, however, features many tweaks to the gameplay modes.</p><h3>Quickplay</h3><p style="">Either as solo or a group, Quickplay allows players to play songs with ease by simply selecting songs to play off of the list of all songs that have been unlocked. <i>Rock Band 2</i>, however, features a way of creating a setlist of many songs to play in order without having to stop to select a new song after completing another, which allows for a quick transition from song to song. Quickplay can be played with players locally on the same console, online with players across the console's mutliplayer service, or a combination of both.</p><h3>Band World Tour</h3><p style="">Contrary to <i>Rock Band</i>, the Band World Tour mode acts as both the single and mutliplayer career-like mode. <i>Rock Band 2</i> no longer offers a single player mode that simply progresses the player through each difficulty of songs down the list. Instead, Band World Tour</p><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/21992/839737-rockma_3000x2000_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-839737" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.66666666666667" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:66.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/21992/839737-rockma_3000x2000_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-839737"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/21992/839737-rockma_3000x2000_1.jpg"></a><figcaption>Create a band and rock the world.</figcaption></figure><p style="">can now be played with any combination of instruments, including a single person. The need for a band leader has also been eliminated, so any player can jump in at any time and play. The core of Band World Tour has remained in tact: players form their own fictional rock band, name it, choose a hometown from a small selection, and progress from city to city around the world as they unlock new venues. Setlists start with simpler songs, but eventually grow into long, difficult sets as the band reaches its final stages of success. Setlists also feature downloadble content, as opposed to only on-disc songs. Throughout their career, players will unlock new cities by earning new methods of transportation, staff members that help them earn more money and fans, and new instruments, clothing, and accessories for their characters that they buy with the money. Band World Tour mode is also able to be played online now, allowing for the creation of online bands, and players are also able to assign the premade characters or their own to fill in the empty spots in a band if there are not four people playing.</p><h3>Tour Challenges</h3><p style="">Another new feature of Band World Tour mode are Tour Challenges, premade setlists that have an underlying theme, such as songs from a specific decade, that players can complete to earn achievements, songs, or other unlocks for their characters.</p><h3>Battle of the Bands</h3><p style="">The last new sub-mode of Band World Tour is the Battle of the Bands, which lets players compete in weekly challenges that compare their scores to others'. The challenges range from a variety of goals, such as obtaining a long streak to simply getting the highest score on the board, and also have certain requirements, like being required to have a vocalist or play on a certain difficulty. Each battle has a leaderboard that compares your score to other player's. Battles can include downloadable content, and are often ideas contributed by the players of the <i>Rock Band</i> community.</p><h2>New Features</h2><h3>Drum Trainer</h3><p style=""><i>Rock Band 2</i> offers a mode in which players can attempt to teach those having trouble keeping time on the drums with a new drum trainer. It has a series of different drum beats ranging from basic patterns to more challenging rhythms, of which players can choose to play on different speeds to increase their skills, as well as a variety of common drum fill patterns. It also contains a freeplay mode, in which players can simply play whatever they want, or even play along with songs from an MP3 player or on their system's harddrive. To get the full effect of playing on a real kit, the cymbal expansions are ideal. All three modes also allow players to choose between a small variety of drum kits to "play on", including the standard <i>Rock Band</i> (1 or 2) kits, electronic, etc.</p><h3>No Fail Mode</h3><p style="">To help make the game more accessible to everyone, No Fail Mode can be turned on so that players cannot fail out of a song if they are performing poorly. This can make the experience more enjoyable for inexperienced players, or for anyone who just wants to play through a tough song without having to be limited to playing it in practice mode.</p><h3>Breakneck Speed</h3><p style="">The Hyperspeed Mode from the Guitar Hero games is back. You can double the scrollspeed of the fretboard for all the instruments, excluding vocals. This makes the notes more spaced out as they come at you, however as a result you cannot see as many notes at a time as you could without Breakneck turned on; it's all a matter of preference.</p><h2>Instruments</h2><h3>Guitar</h3><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7596/193031-rb2_guitar.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-193031" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.66732673267327" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:66.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7596/193031-rb2_guitar.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-193031"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7596/193031-rb2_guitar.jpg"></a><figcaption>Let there be guitar...there was guitar.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Like its predecessor, Rock Band 2 will be available in a bundle featuring all new instrument peripherals. The new Fender Stratocaster guitar, while functioning nearly the same, has a number of improvements from the last and features a new sunburst finish. This new Strat improves on the original Rock Band guitar by having a more reliable strum bar, quieter and more responsive buttons, and a new calibration system that allows you to calibrate the audio/visual lag directly from the guitar. The guitar once again features an effects switch with five effects and the high neck solo buttons. All versions of the guitar are wireless.</p><h3>Drums</h3><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4759/415334-0005.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-415334" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4759/415334-0005.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-415334"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4759/415334-0005.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4759/415334-0005.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Let there be drums....there was drums!</figcaption></figure><p style="">The new drum kit is improved in terms of functionality by offering more responsive pads with better rebound. The pads are also quieter and velocity sensitive, meaning the volume of the notes will be determined by how hard you hit the pads. The kit also includes a new kick pedal that will be reinforced with metal plating, offering a far more reliable and longer lasting pedal. Additionally, the kick pedal can now be attached to the bottom of the drum set so that it doesn't drop when the set is lifted. Expansion plugs are also located on the back of the kit which allow you to plug in optional cymbal additions (sold separately). These cymbals can be used to play yellow, blue, and green notes, allowing up to three cymbals on a drum kit. While there is no visual indication of when a cymbal is being played as opposed to a tom or snare, players can enhance their musical experience by using their own judgment to correctly play both on the cymbals and pads. With all three colored cymbals plugged in, the yellow, blue, and green pads will act as toms during freestyle fills, and the cymbals will all act as cymbals (yellow high hat, blue ride, and green crash - players, however, can still use the green pad to hit the fill-ending crash cymbal to activate overdrive). Like the guitar, the drum kit wirelessly connects to the console.</p><h3>Ion Drums</h3><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7596/192893-set_2_lg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-192893" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.53345388788427" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:53.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7596/192893-set_2_lg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-192893"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7596/192893-set_2_lg.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7596/192893-set_2_lg.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ion Drum Set</figcaption></figure><p style="">Ion Audio has also developed a premium drum kit that can function both as a <i>Rock Band</i> peripheral and an actual electronic drum kit by purchase of a electronic drum module, or "drum brain." The Ion kit, like <i>Rock Band's</i> sports four pads and a bass pedal, as well as two cymbals, with the option of a third.</p><h3>Microphone</h3><p style="">The mic offered for <i>Rock Band 2</i> is the same as its predecessor aesthetically wise, however included an upgraded phoneme detector that increases the accuracy of the atonal "talkie" bits of a song's vocal part. Additionally, any microphone can be used.</p><h3>Compatibility</h3><p style="">All Rock Band instruments are compatible with Rock Band 2, and vice versa. Additionally, for the Xbox 360 and PS3, all other instrument peripherals from games such as Guitar Hero World Tour and Rock Revolution are compatible as well. This is not the case on the Wii due to technical differences. The <a data-ref-id="3030-21171" href="/lips/3030-21171/" slug="lips">Lips</a> and <a data-ref-id="3030-20462" href="/singstar/3030-20462/" slug="singstar">Sing Star</a> microphones are compatible on the Xbox 360 via a title update released on September 25, 2009.</p><h2>Setlist</h2><p style="">All 84 on-disc songs in Rock Band 2 are master recordings. Additionally, 55 songs may be imported from the original <a data-ref-id="3030-9860" href="/rock-band/3030-9860/" slug="rock-band">Rock Band</a> setlist after downloading a $5 export key from either the PlayStation Store or the Xbox Live Marketplace. You may also export the 45 songs from <a data-ref-id="3030-25765" href="/lego-rock-band/3030-25765/" slug="lego-rock-band">Lego Rock Band</a> to Rock Band 2 for $10. The exporting feature does not work for the Wii.</p><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/24/176179-rb2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-176179" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.7981180496151" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:179.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/24/176179-rb2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-176179"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/24/176179-rb2.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/24/176179-rb2.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Let there be rock!</figcaption></figure><ul><li><b>AC/DC</b> “Let There Be Rock” - 1970s</li><li><b>AFI</b> “Girl’s Not Grey” - 2000’s</li><li><b>Alanis Morissette</b> “You Oughta Know” - 1990’s</li><li><b>Alice in Chains</b> “Man in the Box” - 1990’s</li><li><b>Allman Brothers</b> “Ramblin’ Man" - 1970’s</li><li><b>Avenged Sevenfold</b> “Almost Easy” - 2000’s</li><li><b>Bad Company</b> “Shooting Star” - 1970’s</li><li><b>Beastie Boys</b> "So Whatcha Want” - 1990’s</li><li><b>Beck</b> “E-Pro” - 2000’s</li><li><b>Bikini Kill</b> “Rebel Girl” - 1990’s</li><li><b>Billy Idol</b> “White Wedding Pt.

All DLC is cross-compatible between Rock Band and Rock Band 2.</p><p style="">New copies of Rock Band 2 come with a key that can be redeemed for 20 free downloadable tracks.

Much of the praise was focused on the improvements in the World Tour Mode, the excellent setlist, and the ability to create a band online. A major criticism was that the game was a little too similar to the original Rock Band, and that some of the songs were not fun to play on certain instruments.</p><h2>Rock Band Network</h2><p style="">The Rock Band Network functions as a means of players posting <a data-ref-id="3015-129" href="/user-generated-content/3015-129/" slug="user-generated-content">user-generated content</a> to Rock Band. Although from a glance it appears to be a response to the <a data-ref-id="3015-2284" href="/music-creation/3015-2284/" slug="music-creation">song creation</a> tools found in some of the latest <a data-ref-id="3030-20673" href="/guitar-hero-world-tour/3030-20673/" slug="guitar-hero-world-tour">Guitar Hero</a> titles, RBN is an incredibly robust service. At its core, the Network allows for any music owners (be they the artists themselves or legal owners of the intellectual property) to add their song to the Rock Band store. Subscribers to the service can submit a song and create a note chart and background performance using a combination of some of Harmonix's tools, as well as an <a data-ref-id="3015-2533" href="/xna/3015-2533/" slug="xna">XNA</a> development kit.</p><p style="">At present, the service only exists for Xbox 360 Rock Band 2 owners with a membership to the XNA Creators Club. Songs published via the Rock Band Network will be sold in the Xbox Live Marketplace as well as the PlayStation Store with a portion of the proceeds going to the music's creator. RBN has enormous potential for essentially everyone involved: Independent artists will have a way to gain exposure and profit from their music, while established, mainstream artists who somehow aren't yet featured in the game will have another method of submitting their creations.</p><p style="">Several artists have already announced plans to post music for Rock Band Network including Evanescence, Creed, and <a data-ref-id="3040-89796" href="/jonathan-coulton/3040-89796/" slug="jonathan-coulton">Jonathan Coulton</a>. Additionally many of Harmonix's in-house bands (Bang Camaro, etc.) have gone on record saying they will be making contributions.</p><p style="">Gamers can only download songs released on Rock Band Network, if they have access to XNA in their country. As a result, locations such as Australia are unable to partake in the Rock Band Network at this time.</p><h2>Xbox 360 Game Installation</h2><p style="">Rock Band 2 requires 6.3 GB of space to be installed on an Xbox 360 HDD.</p><h2>Star System Patch</h2><p style="">Due to feedback and demand from Rock Band players, a star system was implemented into Rock Band 2 by a patch. It allows you to sort the songs by how many stars you have received in a song. Note that it clears the songs you have already played, so you won't see your star progress unless you play the songs again. The sorting is similar to how you sort by genre, band, etc. The patch was released for the Xbox 360 in summer of 2009 and released on PS3 early 2010.</p><h2>Rock Band Network</h2><p style="">Rock Band 2 has patched in access to Harmonix's third party content system, <a data-ref-id="3015-7161" href="/rock-band-network/3015-7161/" slug="rock-band-network">Rock Band Network</a>. This was the first Rock Band title to have this feature, although it was patched in. It allows for third parties to create their own music tracks without going through a Harmonix approval process.

Thirty years prior, the monarch of Ehb was assassinated. <a href="/jeyne-kassynder/3005-22753/" data-ref-id="3005-22753">Jeyne Kassynder</a> blamed the 10th Legion for his demise and went to war with the legionnaires. With the Azunite church behind her, she defeated the 10th Legion and has spent the years since eradicating every last cell of legionnaires in hiding. There were some survivors, however. Descendants of the Legion with legion blood were scattered around the country. The last legionnaire, Odo, has been watching over them.</p><p style="">A gathering has been called by Odo, requesting the Legion descendants to travel to Rukkenvahl. It is here that the game starts. Odo believes it is time to rebuild the 10th Legion and take back the kingdom they once protected before Jeyne Kassynder took it from them.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/65194/1796561-ds3_17.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1796561" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/65194/1796561-ds3_17.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1796561"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/65194/1796561-ds3_17.jpg"></a><figcaption>AoE attacks also make prettier Screenshots.</figcaption></figure><p style="">At first glance Dungeon Siege 3 should appear pretty familiar to anyone with passing knowledge of overhead action games, but Obsidian has made three major changes. First, there are no potions in the game. Healing is done through a combination of spells and instant health pickups that drop from enemies or reaching a save point. The second change plays into the lack of instant healing through a potion and that is a dodge mechanism. The addition of the dodge puts more emphasis on strategic battles and in preventing damage rather than healing it. The third change is in how abilities are handled. Each character has nine abilities; three defensive and six offensive. The offensive abilities are grouped as sets of three in two separate groups labelled as stances.</p><p style="">The stances offer two differing playstyles, for instance one stance is for ranged fighting and the other is for melee. These abilities evolve as you level up and assign points to them, becoming more powerful as well as gaining secondary effects. Stances can be freely switched with a button press allowing for a quick response to new threats. The stance changes make for a quick feel of combat.</p><p style="">As the first Dungeon Siege game designed for consoles there are some changes to the general gameplay as well. Movement is handled freely through the left analog stick while camera control is handled by the right stick. Your main attack and three current offensive special attacks are mapped to the face buttons while other functions like changing stances and activating your defensive abilites are handled by the shoulder buttons. Blocking is done automatically when the defend button is held and dodging is performed by moving the character while holding the defend button.</p><p style="">Many tropes of the dungeon crawling genre are still retained in the game. Treasure chests and breakable objects are plentiful and contain gold, health orbs, and loot. As you fight off mobs they will drop random loot that may be used by your party. Even though you are only able to equip certain armor to your chosen character; all other loot can be equiped to your companions or sold off. Some loot you collect is instantly reflected as gold in your inventory. Such examples are gold/silver bars or candelabras. Stores are scattered throughout the world as well and offer a wide range of equipment for sale.</p><h2>Playable Characters</h2><p style="">Different from previous Dungeon Siege games, there are now four playable characters, each with their own pre-set abilities instead of a main character that you create at the beginning of the adventure. The four characters are:</p><h3><a href="/lucas-montbarron/3005-18688/" data-ref-id="3005-18688">Lucas Montbarron</a></h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1823414-dungeon_siege_iii__4_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1823414" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1823414-dungeon_siege_iii__4_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1823414"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/62890/1823414-dungeon_siege_iii__4_.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/62890/1823414-dungeon_siege_iii__4_.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Lucas Montbarron</figcaption></figure><p style="">Descended from Lady Montbarron, the protagonist of the original Dungeon Siege game, Lucas is the son of Hugh Montbarron, the Grand Master of the 10th Legion who thirty years ago who led the Legion during their failed fight against Jeyne Kassynder.

Katarina was raised in like and her stances makes full use of her magic and guns. At range she uses a combination of a rifle and magical curses, close up she uses a pair of shotguns and sorcery.</p><h2>Multiplayer</h2><p style="">The co-op aspect of Dungeon Siege 3 will not allow you to bring your single player character into another person's game. When you join another persons game, you will choose which hero you want to play as. You will always be the same level as the host due to downed players still receiving XP. The host is limited to the same character for the entire campaign. It's not possible for multiple people to play the same character.</p><p style="">The client has complete control over their character as if they would be playing single player. The only noticeable change is that the host controls the dialogue selections. Clients are still able to make their dialogue preference known with a vote.</p><p style="">A client can freely manage their own equipment, abilities, and specializations. Inventory and money is shared with the host, allowing the client(s) to use the vendor and purchase items at will. There is no way to "bank" items or restrict certain items from being accidentally sold.</p><h2>DLC</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1879267-ds3dlc1ms05screenshot05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1879267" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1879267-ds3dlc1ms05screenshot05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1879267"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1879267-ds3dlc1ms05screenshot05.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1879267-ds3dlc1ms05screenshot05.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Treasures of the Sun DLC</figcaption></figure><p style="">The first downloadable package was available in October 2011 called Dungeon Siege III: Treasures of the Sun.

When the returning <a href="/aliens/3015-186/" data-ref-id="3015-186">aliens</a> (which the President of the United States claim to be friendly), start a wide-scale <a href="/alien-invasion/3015-408/" data-ref-id="3015-408">invasion</a> to capture all of <a href="/earth/3035-65/" data-ref-id="3035-65">Earth's</a> women (including Duke's "playmates", the <a href="/mary-holsom/3005-18839/" data-ref-id="3005-18839">Holsom</a> twins), Duke (with help from Earth Defense Force head General Graves) must find a way to stop the invasion and rescue the women (while curb-stomping every alien he can find).</p><h2>Story</h2><p style="">Duke Nukem Forever is set twelve years after the events of <a href="/duke-nukem-3d/3030-3407/" data-ref-id="3030-3407">Duke Nukem 3D</a>. The first level is a recreation of Duke 3D's final boss battle with the <a href="/cycloid-emperor/3015-7033/" data-ref-id="3015-7033">Cycloid Emperor</a>. Once players have defeated said Emperor, the camera pans out to reveal that it really was: Duke playing his own video game while being given oral sex by the <a href="/mary-holsom/3005-18839/" data-ref-id="3005-18839">Holsom</a> twins. Duke is living the life (he's apparently retired) and he has everything: <a href="/currency/3015-575/" data-ref-id="3015-575">money</a>, girls, and, most of all, <a href="/reputation/3015-2741/" data-ref-id="3015-2741">fame</a>. The game then proceeds to explain that a potential alien invasion has begun as giant alien ships have appeared around the world and right outside of Duke's casino, the Lady Killer. However, the President of the <a href="/the-united-states-of-america/3035-396/" data-ref-id="3035-396">United States</a> wishes that the aliens be left alone.</p><p style="">After beating his own game, Duke goes to a TV interview. Unfortunately, the interview is canceled when the so-called friendly <a href="/aliens/3015-186/" data-ref-id="3015-186">aliens</a> begin invading. Duke hurries back to the Duke Cave where he has a conference call between him, the President of the United States and General Graves (head of the Earth Defense Force). The President clearly states that Duke is not to engage the aliens, as he is already in negotiations with their Emperor; the President doesn't want another alien <a href="/genocide/3015-3075/" data-ref-id="3015-3075">genocide</a> (said genocide was perpetrated by Duke 12 years earlier). Graves is forced to comply. However, when the Aliens attack the Duke cave it becomes apparent that the aliens are out for revenge. Duke successfully destroys their <a href="/mothership/3015-3572/" data-ref-id="3015-3572">mothership</a> but is knocked out in the process.</p><p style="">Four hours later, Duke discovers that the aliens are capturing all of Earth's women, which enrages both Duke and Graves. All the women (including the Holsom twins) have been regrouped to the Duke Dome and Nukem plans on saving them. Duke heads over to the Duke Dome and discovers the alien's plans: they're collecting women and impregnating them with alien babies. After watching the Holsom twins die (he cruelly tells them that they're "fucked" seconds before they gruesomely explode, unleashing alien babies), Duke gets <a href="/revenge/3015-1363/" data-ref-id="3015-1363">revenge</a> by killing the "Queen Bitch" before once again being knocked out and having an erotic dream. In his dream, he owns an awesome <a href="/strip-club/3035-2718/" data-ref-id="3035-2718">strip club</a> full of awesome dudes and beautiful women. During this sequence, the player is required to collect three things to have sex with one of the <a href="/strippers/3015-2080/" data-ref-id="3015-2080">strippers</a>: <a href="/popcorn/3055-4246/" data-ref-id="3055-4246">popcorn</a>, a <a href="/dildo/3055-833/" data-ref-id="3055-833">vibrator</a> and a <a href="/condom/3055-1929/" data-ref-id="3055-1929">condom</a>. The scene ends right before the sex scene.</p><p style="">Duke wakes up and takes a helicopter to the <a href="/hoover-dam/3035-3072/" data-ref-id="3035-3072">Hoover Dam</a> where the wormhole the aliens came out of is located. Graves has "flipped off" the president and has decided to help out Duke who plans on finishing the aliens off once and for all. Not being able to land near the Dam, the E.D.F. drops off Duke's monster truck, The Mighty Foot. Making his way to the <a href="/dam/3055-2810/" data-ref-id="3055-2810">Dam</a> and fighting aliens along the way, Graves inexplicably believes the only way to close the alien <a href="/wormhole/3055-2004/" data-ref-id="3055-2004">wormhole</a> is by destroying the <a href="/hoover-dam/3035-3072/" data-ref-id="3035-3072">Hoover Dam</a>, which Duke does after his partner fails to plant the charges at the base of the Dam. After closing the wormhole, he meets with the President who is extremely angry. He wanted to negotiate with the alien emperor so they could rule together. Now that his plans have been foiled by Duke, he plans to nuke him to kingdom come. He orders the nuke strike but gets killed by the alien emperor who is then defeated by Duke, who pisses in the emperor's eye socket. Graves comes to pick Duke up via helicopter but the nuke goes off, crashing the helicopter and apparently killing Duke Nukem.</p><p style="">A screen appears stating that Duke is KIA. However, Duke states that that ending is stupid (breaking the fourth wall in the process) and that he can't die. The game cuts to a press conference where Duke has just been sworn in as the 68th President of the United States.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129918/1816391-2011_06_16_00003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1816391" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129918/1816391-2011_06_16_00003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1816391"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/129918/1816391-2011_06_16_00003.jpg"></a><figcaption>A billiards minigame.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Like its predecessor Duke Nukem 3D, Duke Nukem Forever is a first person shooter. Despite the length of the game's development, the game features numerous gameplay elements that are commonplace among modern games of the genre; such features include <a href="../../regenerating-health/92-83/" rel="nofollow">regenerating health</a>, <a href="../../sprinting/92-603/" rel="nofollow">sprinting</a>, <a href="../../useable-vehicles/92-2603/" rel="nofollow">driving sections</a>, and only being able to carry two weapons at once.</p><p style="">As in Duke Nukem 3D, interaction with the environment is a big part of the game. Duke can interact with objects such as toilets, whiteboards and gym equipment. The game also has a large variety of <a href="/minigames/3015-116/" data-ref-id="3015-116">minigames</a> available; these include <a href="/pinball/3045-83/" data-ref-id="3045-83">pinball machines</a>, billiard tables and slot machines. Interacting with certain objects in the environment can grant Duke an "ego boost" by extending the maximum size of his health gauge, referred to in the game as his ego.</p><p style="">Upon completion of the single player game, an extras menu is unlocked that includes:</p><ul><li>Development timeline.</li><li><a href="/e3/3015-3168/" data-ref-id="3015-3168">E3</a> trailers and game play videos from 1997–2007.</li><li>Triptych office pics.</li><li><a href="/concept-art/3015-3763/" data-ref-id="3015-3763">Concept art</a>.</li><li>A Duke Nukem soundboard.</li></ul><h3>Multiplayer</h3><p style="">The multiplayer has four modes that are a variations on common multiplayer modes like <a href="../../deathmatch/92-451/" rel="nofollow">deathmatch</a>, <a href="../../team-deathmatch/92-2463/" rel="nofollow">team deathmatch</a>, <a href="../../capture-the-flag/92-25/" rel="nofollow">capture the flag</a> and <a href="../../king-of-the-hill/92-1292/" rel="nofollow">king of the hill</a>. Duke Nukem Forever shipped with ten maps, including some with <a href="../../jet-pack/93-6/" rel="nofollow">jetpacks</a> in them and some that are designed to be played while Duke is shrunken to tiny size. It features an eight player limit with two teams of four for <a href="../../team-deathmatch/92-2463/" rel="nofollow">team deathmatch</a>.</p><p style="">The name of DNF's multiplayer modes put a spin on standard names:</p><ul><li>Deathmatch is called Dukematch, where everyone has a Duke Nukem skin.</li><li>Capture the flag is called Capture the Babe, where players carry "babes" back to their home base. The "babe" will sometimes protest and the player can give her a "reassuring slap" to calm her down. This slapping mode, along with the rampant misogyny present throughout the campaign, led to a boycott call by Women's right activist Shelby Knox.</li><li>King of the Hill is called Hail to the King.</li></ul><h2>Weapons</h2><p style="">Duke Nukem has a variety of weapons at his disposal for killing the evil women-stealing aliens.</p><h3>Gold <a href="/m1911/3055-61/" data-ref-id="3055-61">M1911</a></h3><p style="">Duke's primary weapon, this weapon is a gold plated <a href="/pistol/3055-59/" data-ref-id="3055-59">pistol</a> with <a href="/laser-sight/3055-1819/" data-ref-id="3055-1819">laser sights</a>. The pistol was designed to be as realistic as possible, which is why during development, <a href="/george-broussard/3040-1866/" data-ref-id="3040-1866">George Broussard</a> brought in a real gun so the designers could play with it and transcribe the feeling of wielding one in the game, but the in-game first person model is pretty inaccurate in terms of proportions. There was also much internal debate on what kind of accessories the gun was to have (at one point it was supposed to be a scoped pistol) but the designers just opted for laser sights on the bottom of the frame. <a href="/pig-cop/3015-2814/" data-ref-id="3015-2814">Pig Cops</a> and EDF soldiers will drop a plain, black M1911 when they're dead. The previous <i>Duke Nukem Forever</i> builds that ran on different <a href="/unreal-engine-1/3015-1919/" data-ref-id="3015-1919">engines</a> had a more interesting <a href="/desert-eagle/3055-90/" data-ref-id="3055-90">Gold Desert Eagle</a> instead of the Gold M1911.</p><h3><a href="/freezethrower/3055-3442/" data-ref-id="3055-3442">Freezethrower</a></h3><p style="">The freeze ray is a short ranged weapon that allows players to freeze enemies for a certain period of time. Unlike the superior weapon from Duke Nukem 3D, this freezethrower only works at short range, which was intentional according to the developers since players would lose a significant portion of health while approaching enemies, but would regain it once frozen. When the enemy is in a frozen state, Duke can or shoot them, or perform a violent execution move involving shattering the enemy into little pieces.</p><h3><a href="/shotgun/3055-114/" data-ref-id="3055-114">Shotgun</a></h3><p style="">The pump action shotgun lets off six rounds and is the most effective at close range. The gun was modeled after a shotgun that George Broussard bought in a gun shop in Mesquite, Texas. Broussard brought the gun to the office so it could be designed into the game. The gun is now said to reside in a closet at Broussard's home. It is the same shotgun that was used in Duke Nukem 3D, based on a Winchester 1300 with a heatshield mounted on the barrel, stock removed, and pistol grips installed on both the rear and the pump-action parts of the gun.</p><h3><a href="/railgun/3055-25/" data-ref-id="3055-25">Railgun</a></h3><p style="">The railgun is a long range weapon equipped with a scope, essentially a sniper rifle with a different name. It usually takes enemies out in one shot. The weapon was included in the game when the developers decided to design outdoor environments with vast open ground that was ideal for sniping.</p><h3><a href="/ripper-chaingun/3055-1896/" data-ref-id="3055-1896">Ripper</a></h3><p style="">The ripper is a massive machine gun that fires from three different barrels. The weapon was originally planned to be an M16; however, it was redesigned to look like Duke Nukem 3D's iconic ripper after the development team changed game engines and decided to create full 3D renders of each weapon, one of the only intelligent moves made regarding the game's arsenal.</p><h3><a href="/rocket-launcher/3055-211/" data-ref-id="3055-211">RPG</a></h3><p style="">The rocket-propelled grenade launcher fires one rocket at a time and is designed after the same RPG in Duke Nukem 3D. players can guide the launched grenade by keeping the reticule on the target after the rocket has been fired.</p><h3><a href="/shrink-ray/3055-839/" data-ref-id="3055-839">Shrink Ray</a></h3><p style="">The shrink ray lets players shrink enemies. By shrinking an enemy, the player can easily squash them with Duke's boot. Also, shrunken enemies have less firepower when shrunk. The shrink ray was born more than a decade ago, as it is one of the legacy weapons from Duke Nukem 3D.</p><h3><a href="/devastator/3055-3441/" data-ref-id="3055-3441">Devastator</a></h3><p style="">A twin-rocket launcher that shoots mini-rockets at a high rate of fire. It fires 2 mini-rockets with each shot.</p><h2><a href="/easter-egg/3015-2/" data-ref-id="3015-2">Easter Eggs</a></h2><h3>Roulette Table</h3><p style="">If the player examines the last paid numbers at any of the roulette tables the following numbers can be seen: 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42. This is a subtle nod to the popular television show <a href="/lost/3025-1777/" data-ref-id="3025-1777">Lost</a>, which was still on the air when the game was written.</p><h2>Development History</h2><p style="">Developer <a href="../../3d-realms-entertainment/65-480/" rel="nofollow">3D Realms</a> began work on Duke Nukem Forever in 1997. Beset with extensive delays, the release date was pushed back again and again until the company chose not to disclose a release date until the project was close to completion. However, that time never came, and the company halted development on May 6, 2009, twelve years after development began, due to a depletion of development funds. The entire development staff was also let go.</p><p style="">Following this turn of events, <a href="../../randy-pitchford/72-4430/" rel="nofollow">Randy Pitchford</a> and <a href="../../gearbox-software-llc/65-1615/" rel="nofollow">Gearbox Software</a> approached 3D Realms heads <a href="../../scott-miller/72-1868/" rel="nofollow">Scott Miller</a> and <a href="../../george-broussard/72-1866/" rel="nofollow">George Broussard</a> with a proposal that would see Gearbox take over the remainder of the game's development. After a deal was struck and the remaining legal hurdles were cleared, Gearbox set to work on Duke Nukem Forever in secrecy. On September 3, 2010, Gearbox unveiled the revived Duke Nukem Forever project to the world at <a href="../../pax-2010/92-5375/" rel="nofollow">PAX 2010</a>. As proof of their work, they provided a playable demo spanning two sections of the game accessible to press and convention goer alike, and a trailer filled with gameplay footage.</p><h3>Timeline</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/21641/810805-7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-810805" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.79298245614035" data-width="285" style="width: 285px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:79.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/21641/810805-7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-810805"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/21641/810805-7.jpg"></a><figcaption>One of the earliest builds of the game.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The development of Duke Nukem Forever was <a href="../../development-hell/92-1339/" rel="nofollow">a rocky ride</a>.

The lead designer stated the transition would take "a month to six weeks" and that the game would be delayed until late 1999, also ensuring that the features shown in the E3 '98 demo would be carried over to the Unreal Engine.</li><li>In 1999, 3D Realms announced they had upgraded to a newer version of the Unreal Engine, the same used in Epic Games' <a href="/">Unreal Tournament</a>, resulting in a second delay of release. 3D Realms released another set of screenshots on November 1st, showcasing Duke Nukem Forever running on the Unreal Engine for the first time.

Several new programmers were brought on board in 2002, and the development team rewrote the Unreal Engine renderer and several other modules, adding technology from an early version of Unreal Engine 2. According to George Broussard, approximately 95% of level design content was scrapped in the process, causing yet another severe delay in the game's development.</li><li>On May 20, 2003, Jeffery Lapin, the then-CEO of Take-Two, told the press that Duke Nukem Forever would not be released in 2003, apparently without the consent of 3D Realms. In a furious response, Broussard responded on Shacknews saying that <i>"</i>Take-Two needs to STFU IMO.<i>"</i> In December of that same year, Lapin said that the game was expected to be finished by late 2004/early 2005.</li><li>In September 2004, Broussard announced the replacement of DNF's Karma physics engine with a physics engine designed by Swedish Studio Meqon, causing further delay.</li></ul><p style=""><strong>2005 - 2006</strong></p><ul><li>Rumors in April 2005 suggested that Duke Nukem Forever would appear at <a href="/e3-2005/3015-3437/" data-ref-id="3015-3437">E3 2005</a> along with 3D Realms' previously canceled Prey.

One notable demonstration, according to the May 2006 issue of Computer Games Magazine, featured the interactive use of an in-game computer to send actual e-mails.</li><li>In June, in a filing with the SEC, Take-Two revealed that they had renegotiated the terms of the publishing agreement and would pay 3D Realms $4.25 million instead of $6 million upon the release of the game. The filing also revealed that Take-Two was offering a $500,000 bonus if DNF was commercially released by December 31, 2006. However, Broussard denied the rumors that DNF would be released before the end of the year. Quoted in a <a href="/">Gamespot</a> article published on June 13th, 2006, he stated:</li></ul><blockquote data-align="center" data-size="small"><p style="">"As for the 500k completion bonus, I don't even know where that came from...I do know that we never cared or asked for it, and I think it was just tossed in as part of some other agreement. We're certainly not motivated by that amount of money, after all this time, and getting the game right is what matters. I would never ship a game early (even a couple of months), for 500k."</p></blockquote><ul><li>The same article also quoted Broussard regarding the game's funding. "We're making the game. It'll be done when it's done. We've funded 99.999% of the game (aside from a very, very small advance from GT Interactive, years ago, before Take 2 bought the game from them). It's our risk, our necks and our gamble.

In the days following the initial leaks and subsequent confirmations, development art and video assets for the game were leaked to the internet, giving the public a glimpse of what Duke Nukem Forever looked like prior to the studio's closure.</li><li>The following week, Take-Two Interactive <a href="/">filed a breach of contract suit against Apogee Software Ltd.</a>, the company behind the 3D Realms label.

Among his quotes, he stated that despite Take-Two paying Infogrames $12 million for the publishing rights to DNF, 3D Realms "didn't get a penny of that." He went on to note that "This, along with so much else, is 100% spin, being eaten up by those who have no clue whatsoever." In the same article, Miller also denied rumors that 3D Realms turned down an offer to sell the Duke Nukem IP to Take-Two for $30 million and stated that no such offer was ever made.</li></ul><p style=""><strong>2010</strong></p><ul><li>On June 11th, 2010, <a href="/">Shacknews</a> reported that the lawsuit between Take Two and 3D Realms/Apogee was dismissed with prejudice.

"Dismissal with prejudice" stipulates that both sides are legally barred from filing lawsuits under the same claim, essentially ending the long-running legal dispute between the companies.</li><li>On August 10, 2010, an unnamed source had told <a href="/">Kotaku</a> that Gearbox Software is continuing the development of Duke Nukem Forever.

Even other game developers have taken cracks at Duke Nukem Forever's expense, such as when a character in <a href="../../grasshopper-manufacture-inc/65-2188/" rel="nofollow">Grasshopper Manufacture's</a> <a href="../../no-more-heroes/61-5581/" rel="nofollow">No More Heroes</a> breaks the <a href="../../breaking-the-fourth-wall/92-138/" rel="nofollow">fourth wall</a> in explaining a theoretical development delay scenario that could have resulted in the game's name being changed to No More Heroes Forever.</p><p style="">Duke Nukem Forever had also been given a catalog of unflattering nicknames over the years, all related to the length of its development and the possibility that it may never see release at all, such as "Duke Nukem Never" and "Duke Nukem Taking Forever." It has also been pointed out on numerous occasions that the game's initials, DNF, are also used in automotive racing parlance to place competitors that "did not finish."</p><p style="">Shortly after 3D Realms halted work on the project, the creator of the internet web-series Zero Punctuation, <a href="../../ben-croshaw/72-89641/" rel="nofollow">Ben 'Yahztee' Croshaw</a>, released a mock review of Duke Nukem Forever stating that if a studio had over a decade to develop a game, then it should be the greatest game ever made. He also stated that people shouldn't feel bad about the fate of 3D Realms because they were under contract to finish the game and over the extended duration of the development had lost a great deal of sympathy from the gaming public.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17015/1818437-dukeforever_2011_06_14_20_50_04_65.png" data-ref-id="1300-1818437" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17015/1818437-dukeforever_2011_06_14_20_50_04_65.png" data-ref-id="1300-1818437"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/17015/1818437-dukeforever_2011_06_14_20_50_04_65.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/17015/1818437-dukeforever_2011_06_14_20_50_04_65.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Many console players noted the long load times.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The game was finally released in Europe on June 10, 2011 and in North America June 14, 2011. The game received poor reviews, with Metacritic giving it separate metascores hovering around 50 for the PC, Xbox 360, and PS3 versions. The game was criticized on multiple fronts. The graphics were said to be out dated and the gameplay boring. Reviewers also stated that Duke Nukem as a character did not have a place anymore in modern gaming since the character had failed to evolve after twelve years of development. The console versions were noted to have long loading times (1+ min) and inconsistent frame rates. The PC version does not have these issues. The only praise that can really be found for the game is the fact that it was released. Giant Bomb's <a href="/jeff-gerstmann/3040-89712/" data-ref-id="3040-89712">Jeff Gerstmann</a> said the following about the title:</p><blockquote><p style="">If you're not willing to play a sloppy, cobbled together first-person shooter just because it has some kind of weird historical meaning, though, just forget this ever happened and move on. It's great, in some ways, that Duke Nukem Forever was released at all. But don't be confused into thinking that it's a great game.</p></blockquote><p style="">Following the negative reviews, the Redner Group, a firm which was handling Duke Nukem Forever's marketing campaign, issued a statement on June 15, 2011 saying that due to venomous reviews, they'd be reviewing who should get early copies of future games because according to them, some reviewers "took it too far". Later that day, the Redner Group apologized, stating that the threat was made under emotional duress and that Take-Two Interactive had nothing to do with the idea. That same day, Take-Two severed ties with the Redner Group and no longer employs them to market their games.</p><p style="">Some of the staff behind the game came to its public defense in response to the overwhelmingly negative reviews. <a href="/jon-st-john/3040-1962/" data-ref-id="3040-1962">Jon St. John</a>, the voice of Duke Nukem, told JoyPads:</p><blockquote><p style="">I have no comments regarding bad reviews by clueless critics. They seem to want to compare Duke Nukem Forever to Call Of Duty and other FPS' and they are missing the point. My thoughts about Duke Nukem Forever: It freakin' rocks! Lots of action, lots of fun, sexy, funny, irreverent... It's everything I hoped it would be.</p></blockquote><p style="">In comparing the game's low review scores and high sales figures, Gearbox president Randy Pitchford <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/DuvalMagic/status/81509576322727937" rel="nofollow">tweeted</a> the following:</p><blockquote><p style="">With sales data, It seems like *customers* love Duke.

Pilots will get to dogfight in 50 missions ranging from the Battle of Britain to Sicily, emphasizing a significant shift in Il-2's traditional focus on Europe's Eastern Front. </p> <p style=""> Keep your eyes on the sky! </p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>20722</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/1824046-box_il2sbop.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/1824046-box_il2sbop.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/1824046-box_il2sbop.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/1824046-box_il2sbop.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/1824046-box_il2sbop.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1824046-box_il2sbop.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/1824046-box_il2sbop.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Il-2 Sturmovik: Birds of Prey]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>2</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-18/]]></api_detail_url><id>18</id><name><![CDATA[PEGI: 7+]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-1/]]></api_detail_url><id>1</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: T]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-29/]]></api_detail_url><id>29</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: E10+]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2009-09-08 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-18/]]></api_detail_url><id>18</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation Portable]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-portable/3045-18/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PSP]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-52/]]></api_detail_url><id>52</id><name><![CDATA[Nintendo DS]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-ds/3045-52/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[DS]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-116/]]></api_detail_url><id>116</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation Network (PSP)]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-network-psp/3045-116/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PSPN]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/il-2-sturmovik-birds-of-prey/3030-20722/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20723/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-06-08 11:04:32</date_added><date_last_updated>2012-08-19 04:45:45</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[WWE Legends of Wrestlemania is a wrestling game that features superstars from the past clashing in WrestleMania-themed events. It was developed by  Yuke's, the developer which made the SmackDown! series.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">The game runs on a modified version of the <b><a data-ref-id="3030-20680" href="/wwe-smackdown-vs-raw-2009/3030-20680/" slug="wwe-smackdown-vs-raw-2009">Smackdown vs. Raw</a></b> engine with many of the features changed. The game is controlled with the face buttons with a strike, block, and grab button. There is a three-tier level system that requires you to do some lower level moves to move up to a higher level. The last level of the moves includes your finisher. There is also a chain system that activates when you string together a combo of attacks on your opponent. Time briefly slows down and you and your opponent have a chance to do moves on each other, the person that gets the first strike gets an advantage with an additional attack on the opponent. Managers play a much bigger role in this game depending on the situation (Distractions, attacks, etc) and there is a "Create A Legend Mode" so players can reenact other classic battles with superstars who don't appear in the game. Legends of Wrestlemania includes connectivity with Smackdown vs Raw 2009, with the ability to transfer over created wrestlers, as well as the WWE roster from the game. This enables players to use the current wrestlers against the legends.</p><p style="">Gameplay involves the use of a health gauge, with body damage not playing a part, unlike its sister game. Weapons may now only be accessed if both players are outside and in the right place for that weapon, as well as having the opponent groggy before the option of grabbing a weapon is allowed. As like previous Smackdown games, DQ can be turned on and off, as well as entrances.</p><h2>Game Modes</h2><p style="">One of the main modes for the game is the Wrestlemania Tour Mode. Within this mode players get the chance to either Relive, Rewrite or Redefine many classic Wrestlemania matches from Wrestlemania I - XV.</p><p style="">Relive allows you to basically replay matches such as <a data-ref-id="3005-247" href="/hulk-hogan/3005-247/" slug="hulk-hogan">Hulk Hogan</a> vs <a data-ref-id="3005-4011" href="/andre-the-giant/3005-4011/" slug="andre-the-giant">Andre The Giant</a> from Wrestlemania III or Hulk Hogan vs <a data-ref-id="3005-3591" href="/the-ultimate-warrior/3005-3591/" slug="the-ultimate-warrior">The Ultimate Warrior</a> from Wrestlemania VI or <a data-ref-id="3005-581" href="/steve-austin/3005-581/" slug="steve-austin">Stone Cold Steve Austin</a> vs <a data-ref-id="3005-1674" href="/the-rock/3005-1674/" slug="the-rock">The Rock</a> from Wrestlemania XV. Before each match a short video package shows the fued between the wrestlers featured in the match and also highlights of their actual match from Wrestlemania. You are then given a list of objectives to achieve during the match to make sure you recreate things that actually happened during the real matches. If you achieve enough of the objectives during the match you are awarded with a gold medal which allows you you to progress to the next match and also unlock new match types for use during exhibition matches and also alternate attire for other wrestlers in the game.</p><p style="">Rewrite mode follows the same pattern but allows you to control the losing Superstar from a classic match and attempt to 'Rewrite' the result of match by winning.</p><p style="">Redefine mode allows you to change the conditions of a specific match by perhaps throwing a steel cage into the mix or making Hogan vs Andre a ladder match!!</p><p style="">There is also the Legend Killer Mode which features various tiers of Legend Wrestlers which you can fight in gauntlet style matches with a created wrestler in order to become the ultimate legend in the ring.</p><p style="">Other modes within the game include the traditional singles and tag team modes (with managers), as well as updated modes for ladder match, cage match and hell in a cell. Triple threat matches, handicap, submission matches, and an updated royal rumble mode have also been added to the list.</p><p style="">The following Superstars are default champions within exhibition modes in the game and can defend their titles witin the various match types:</p><p style="">WWE Champion Hulk Hogan, Intercontinental Champion <a data-ref-id="3005-621" href="/rick-rude/3005-621/" slug="rick-rude">'Ravishing' Rick Rude</a>, Tag Team Champions Iron Sheik &amp; Nikolai Volkoff, Million Dollar Champion <a data-ref-id="3040-59819" href="/ted-dibiase/3040-59819/" slug="ted-dibiase">Ted Dibiase</a>.</p><h2>Superstar Roster</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id="3005-4011" href="/andre-the-giant/3005-4011/" slug="andre-the-giant">Andre the Giant</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-20038" href="/road-warrior-animal/3005-20038/" slug="road-warrior-animal">Animal</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-17632" href="/arn-anderson/3005-17632/" slug="arn-anderson">Arn Anderson</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-3198" href="/bam-bam-bigelow/3005-3198/" slug="bam-bam-bigelow">Bam Bam Bigelow</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-558" href="/big-boss-man/3005-558/" slug="big-boss-man">Big Boss Man</a></li><li>Big John Studd</li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-4841" href="/bret-hart/3005-4841/" slug="bret-hart">Bret Hart</a></li><li>Brutus "The Barber" Beefcake</li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-9311" href="/the-british-bulldog/3005-9311/" slug="the-british-bulldog">Davey Boy Smith</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-9491" href="/dusty-rhodes/3005-9491/" slug="dusty-rhodes">Dusty Rhodes</a></li><li>Greg Valentine</li><li>Hacksaw Jim Duggan</li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-20044" href="/road-warrior-hawk/3005-20044/" slug="road-warrior-hawk">Hawk</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-3166" href="/honky-tonk-man/3005-3166/" slug="honky-tonk-man">Honky Tonk Man</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-247" href="/hulk-hogan/3005-247/" slug="hulk-hogan">Hulk Hogan</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-469" href="/triple-h/3005-469/" slug="triple-h">Hunter Hearst Helmsley</a></li><li>Iron Sheik</li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-9328" href="/jake-roberts/3005-9328/" slug="jake-roberts">Jake "The Snake" Roberts</a></li><li>Jim "The Anvil" Neidhart</li><li>Jimmy "Superfly" Snuka</li><li>Junkyard Dog</li><li>Kamala</li><li>King Kong Bundy</li><li>Koko B.

The game is the first James Bond title to be released by <a href="/activision/3010-78/" data-ref-id="3010-78"> Activision</a> after acquisition of the James Bond video game license in 2006. Being built upon <a href="/infinity-ward/3010-1526/" data-ref-id="3010-1526"> Infinity Ward</a>'s <a href="/iw-engine/3015-7768/" data-ref-id="3015-7768">IW Engine</a>, the game allows for large amounts of environmental damage and other effects, like those found in <a href="/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare/3030-2133/" data-ref-id="3030-2133"> Call of Duty 4</a> and <a href="/call-of-duty-world-at-war/3030-20777/" data-ref-id="3030-20777"> Call of Duty: World at War</a>. Although being focused in a first-person view, the game also switches to a third person view periodically, at points such as quick time events and cover sequences. Quantum of Solace also features a checkpoint system that saves after key events in the story. <a href="/daniel-craig/3040-90200/" data-ref-id="3040-90200"> Daniel Craig</a> provided his likeness and voice to the game, along with actors <a href="http://www.screened.com/mathieu-amalric/14-16091/" rel="nofollow"> Mathieu Amalric</a>, <a href="http://www.screened.com/mads-mikkelsen/14-341416/" rel="nofollow"> Mads Mikkelsen</a> and actresses <a href="/olga-kurylenko/3040-92261/" data-ref-id="3040-92261"> Olga Kurylenko</a>, <a href="/judi-dench/3040-98301/" data-ref-id="3040-98301"> Judi Dench</a> and <a href="/eva-green/3040-92263/" data-ref-id="3040-92263"> Eva Green</a>.</p><p style="">Due to the limitations of the console's hardware, the <a href="/playstation-2/3045-19/" data-ref-id="3045-19"> PlayStation 2</a> version of Quantum of Solace could not take advantage of the Call of Duty 4 engine and became a third person shooter/stealth game instead.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style="">The story in the game follows immediately from the events of the 2006 film <em>Casino Royale</em>. Opening in Mr. White's Estate, the story follows that of Quantum of Solace loosely, but also flashes back to events from <em>Casino Royale</em>. Among these events is the famous chase in Madagascar from the start of <em>Casino Royale</em>, where Bond pursues a bomb-maker through a construction site. Other events were created specifically for the game, such as fighting on the roof of the train traveling to Montenegro. This does not appear in the film, and was created entirely for the game.</p><h2>Story Missions</h2><ol><li>White's Estate</li><li>Siena</li><li>Opera House</li><li>Sink Hole</li><li>Shanty Town</li><li>Construction Site</li><li>Science Center Exterior</li><li>Science Center Interior</li><li>Miami Airport</li><li>Adriatic Express</li><li>Casino Royale</li><li>Casino Poison</li><li>Barge</li><li>Venice</li><li>Eco Hotel</li></ol><h2>Multiplayer</h2><p style="">Multiplayer in Quantum of Solace supports 12 players across seven different game modes on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network. Over the course of a battle, players earn credits that can be used at an in game store, in real-time (without the need to exit out of the game) to purchase new weapons, items and perks. Similar to Call of Duty 4, players can have five different customizable classes for yourself at anytime, and the basic load-out is the same as well, where you will start out with a primary weapon, pistol, and grenades.</p><p style=""> </p><p style="">Different multiplayer modes include:</p><p style=""><b>Classic - </b>Classic deathmatch mode is very similar to the Old-School Deathmatch game type from Call of Duty 4. Instead of choosing from your preset load-outs, all players start out with a pistol and all other weapons are scattered around the map.</p><p style=""><b>Conflict/Team Conflict - </b>Essentially a deathmatch mode that allows you to choose from your preset load-outs. Conflict can also be played as a Team Deathmatch mode.</p><p style=""><b>Territory Control - </b>As the name suggests, Territory Control is all about capturing and defending points across the map.</p><p style=""><b>Bond Versus - </b>A randomly selected player is chosen to be Bond and everyone else is assigned to take him out. The Bond player must either kill all other players or disarm two of three bombs that are placed around the map. In order to make things a bit more balanced, the Bond player is given several advantages like two lives per round, a health boost, a faster run speed than other players, and the ability to see all enemies on his mini-map.</p><p style=""><b>Bond Evasion - </b>Bond Evasion tasks a group of MI6 agents with protecting a randomly selected Bond character as he makes his way to an extraction point. The other team has to take the Bond player out before he reaches the extraction point.</p><p style=""><b>Golden Gun -</b> The Golden Gun mode takes the iconic gold six-shooter from the Bond series and makes it the center of this mode. There are no teams and the only goal is to find the golden gun and kill as many other players with it as possible before you are killed. After the timer runs out, the player with the most points wins.</p><p style=""> </p><h2>Levels</h2><ul><li>White's Estate</li><li>Siena</li><li>Opera House</li><li>Sink Hole</li><li>Shanty

GRID uses an engine modified upon DiRT's Neon engine; called the EGO engine.  It takes a more arcade-style approach to the series along with plenty other new features/changes.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">GRID is spiritual successor to the Toca series, and in this rendition Codemasters made a commitment to develop the game solely on racing. Cutting out anything extra-curricular to motorsports, GRID is based on speed. The cars, hand picked and kept to a minimum are built for high performance, also the real world tracks in the game were kept to the obscure, tracks that usually dont appear in regular racing games.</p><p style="">The GRID racing experience is fast and loose, the controls are forgiving, allowing the driver to take a corner at much higher speeds than usual. Drivers will be able to race in three different regions, <a href="/japan/3035-37/" data-ref-id="3035-37">Japan</a>, <a href="/america/3035-396/" data-ref-id="3035-396">United States</a> and <a href="/europe/3035-289/" data-ref-id="3035-289">Europe</a>.</p><h2>Japan</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1156/223483-0000004324.800x600.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-223483" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1156/223483-0000004324.800x600.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-223483"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1156/223483-0000004324.800x600.jpg"></a><figcaption>Japanese Drift Battle</figcaption></figure><p style="">The Japanese racing experience consists of <a href="/drifting/3015-74/" data-ref-id="3015-74">drift</a> challenges and Touge events.</p><p style="">Drift competitions consist of sliding through turns in order to rack up points, most turns have a red marker on the apex, the closer you get to the marker, while drifting, without hitting it the more points you get. Creating a chain of drifts will result in more points, as well as multiplying the points you've earned in the process. However, making contact with a barrier or an object on the track will immediately drop any points you have active in drifting.</p><p style=""><b>Drift Battle</b> puts you against 5 other drivers, the goal is to score the most drift points before the race ends in the allotted amount of laps. Track position does not matter in this event, although the higher position you are the greater the point modifier is when completing drifts.</p><p style=""><b>Drift GP</b> faces you off with one other driver, you're alone on the track and you must complete drifts to get a higher score than your opponent. Your scores are rated and compared at the end of a race, and whoever earns the most wins the event.</p><p style=""><b>Freestyle</b> Drift places you in an open grid of streets, allowing the driver to choose his own path while drifting, the driver with the most points at the end of the timed event wins.</p><p style=""><b>Touge</b> events consist of a one on one face off on winding mountain roads, neither car can make contact with each other, if a driver makes contact with the car in the lead a time penalty reflective of how hard the car is hit is given as a conseqence that is factored in at the end of the race.</p><h2>United States</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1995/389230-grid_2008_05_10_16_44_21_29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-389230" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1995/389230-grid_2008_05_10_16_44_21_29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-389230"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1995/389230-grid_2008_05_10_16_44_21_29.jpg"></a><figcaption>San Francisco</figcaption></figure><p style="">In the United States drivers race with American horsepower using classic and concept muscle cars on street courses in real world cities such as San Francisco and Washington DC.</p><p style="">Basic events include Pro Muscle events, Touring Car events, as well as Open Wheel racing at courses such as Long Beach. Demolition Derby is also available in the United States region, having no rules the drivers compete in late model stock cars around a course that have hazards such as intersections and jumps increasing the chance of collision.</p><h2>Europe</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1156/223484-0000004323.800x600.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-223484" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1156/223484-0000004323.800x600.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-223484"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1156/223484-0000004323.800x600.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1156/223484-0000004323.800x600.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>BMW at Spa Francorchamps</figcaption></figure><p style="">Drivers compete in professional events and endurance races in Europe, using real world track locations; users have the option to race the 24 Hours of Le Mans in real time, and also may choose racing it in shorter time increments.</p><p style="">Much of the racing structure for European races uses the Le Mans class system, breaking the field up into four separate classes. Le Mans Prototype 1 and 2 as well as the Gran Turismo 1 and 2. The goal of each race is not to finish first overall in the field but first in the class you're competing it. Prototype classes consist of cars with higher horsepower and faster speed while Gran Turismo classes feature lower horsepower cars such as Corvettes and Porches.</p><h2>Grid World</h2><p style="">In Grid World you are an upstart in a new racing team, you start out your career taking driver offers from other teams, raising money to start your own garage. After raising the proper amount of funding you will be able to race on your own team.</p><p style="">Each event you compete in, you will gain more money, reputation and sponsors. Sponsors can be applied to your car to increase your profits by fulfilling incentives during the races. Higher paying sponsors will require more of you, if these goals are not met in the race, you will fail to be compensated.</p><p style="">Race event selection is based on a tiered system, the player has a choice between which races they wish to compete on in each of the three regions, the more reputation points you earn from completeing events higher tiers are unlocked. After a given amount of events each racing season will end, and you will be offered to race in the 24 hours of Le Mans. The player has a choice between driving for another team, or if they have a car thats eligible for the race, they may enter on their own ticket.</p><p style="">At the end of every racing season your team is ranked on reputation and prize money each season. As you progress through the game you are able to hire a teammate, the teammate may have a signing fee and will take a percentage of your winnings, but will also benefit the team by fulfilling sponsorship incentives as well. The better money you earn will allow you to purchase new vehicles as well as hire better drivers as your career progresses.</p><p style="">The game also features name recognition e.g. names like Dave, Matt or Dean will occasionally be called out by your manager or pit chief who will tell you the condition of your vehicle after taking damage or what position you are in.</p><h2>Tracks</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/923012-grid_milan_chase_cam.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-923012" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/923012-grid_milan_chase_cam.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-923012"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/923012-grid_milan_chase_cam.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/923012-grid_milan_chase_cam.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Milan street circuit</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Circuito del Jarama</li><li>Nurburgring Grand Prix Circuit</li><li>Istanbul Park</li><li>Donington Park</li><li>Milan</li><li>Le Mans</li><li>Spa-Francorchamps</li><li>Otukama Grand Circuit</li><li>Yokohama Docks</li><li>Shibuya</li><li>Mount Haruna</li><li>San Francisco</li><li>Washington DC</li><li>Detroit</li><li>Long Beach</li></ul><h2>Car List</h2><ul><li>Aston Martin DBR9</li><li>Audi R10 TDi (LMP1 Class)</li><li>BMW 320Si (Touring Class)</li><li>Chevrolet Camaro Concept</li><li>Chevrolet Corvette C5-R</li><li>Chevrolet Corvette C6-R</li><li>Chevrolet Lacetti</li><li>Courage C65 (LMP2 Class)</li><li>Courage LC70</li><li>Creation CA06/H-JUDD</li><li>Dallara Formula 3 (Open Wheel Class)</li><li>Dodge Challenger Concept</li><li>Dodge Viper SRT-10 (Pro Muscle)</li><li>Doran Racing JE4</li><li>Ferrari F430 GT</li><li>FJ 1000</li><li>Ford Mustang Boss 302 (Classic Muscle Class)</li><li>Ford Mustang GT-R Concept</li><li>Honda NSX-R (Pro Tuned Class)</li><li>Jupiter Eagleray Mk5</li><li>Koenigsegg CCGT (GT1 Class)</li><li>Koenigsegg CCXR</li><li>Lamborghini Murcielago RGT</li><li>Lola B05/40</li><li>Lola B06/10</li><li>Mazda 787B (Prototype Class)</li><li>Mazda RX-7 FD3S (Drift Class)</li><li>Mopar Dodge Charger SRT-8 (Drift Class)</li><li>Nissan 350Z</li><li>Nissan R390 GT-1</li><li>Nissan Silvia</li><li>Nissan Skyline GT-R Z-Tune (Pro Tuned Class)</li><li>Pagani Zonda R (Prestige Class)</li><li>Panoz Esperante</li><li>Plymouth AAR 'Cuda (Classic Muscle Class)</li><li>Pontiac GTO</li><li>Porsche 911 GT3-RSR (GT2 Class)</li><li>Saleen S7R</li><li>Spyker C8 Spyder</li><li>Subaru Impreza</li><li>Toyota Corolla GT-S (AE86)</li><li>Toyota Soarer (JZZ30)</li><li>Toyota Supra (Pro Tuned Class)</li><li>TVR Tuscan Challenge</li></ul><h2>Multiplayer</h2><p style="">GRID features online multiplayer, the servers being based off of a voting system, the participating drivers may vote on which region they wish to race in, as well as which event in that region.

Most of the tracks from the console version remains in tact as well as new and additional tracks.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/16127/566307-944899_20080805_screen005.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-566307" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="1.5" data-width="256" style="width: 256px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:150.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/16127/566307-944899_20080805_screen005.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-566307"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/16127/566307-944899_20080805_screen005.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/16127/566307-944899_20080805_screen005.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Track Editor</figcaption></figure><p style="">Each event usually has 3 medals to be awarded depending on your success in position and/or time on the track. As you win events you will unlock more race locations and track blueprints. Just as in Race Driver Create and Race, GRID has the track editor. The track editor allows the player to design and race on their own courses. They may do this by either entering the garage and selecting that gameplay option, or by entering one of the blueprint events in the career. The blueprint events will have a set amount of rules and requirements in the design. Usually the requirements request specific things, like the amount of 90 degree turns or tunnels on the race track.</p><p style="">Japan has the most drastic of changes, of any region, between the DS and console versions. Featuring multiple new tracks, including the Haneda Airport and Parking garage as well as a new configuration for the Yokohama drift course. Fuji Speedway appears exclusively in the DS version of GRID, available by unlocking it in the single player.</p><p style="">New race modes include Survival and Chase. In these modes you either are placed as the driver who must stay ahead of the chaser for as long as possible, the event ending once the chaser has caught up and passed you. In Chase you must do the same as the previous except catch the other driver in as little time as possible.

It is considered a spiritual successor to the Baldur's Gate series.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Dragon Age: Origins is <a href="/bioware/3010-98/" data-ref-id="3010-98">BioWare</a>'s 2009 dark-fantasy action-RPG. It features tactical party-based combat that can be played from third person, or a more traditional, isometric top-down view. The game features BioWare's signature "Pause and Play" battle mechanics. For its elements, gameplay, and other reasons, Dragon Age: Origins is commonly referred to by BioWare as the spiritual successor to their revered classic roleplaying game, <a href="/baldurs-gate-ii-shadows-of-amn/3030-10637/" data-ref-id="3030-10637">Baldur's Gate 2</a>.</p><h2>Technical</h2><p style="">Built on BioWare's proprietary <a href="/eclipse-engine/3015-1475/" data-ref-id="3015-1475">Eclipse engine</a>, the game features similar "facial technology" to that used with the conversation system in <a href="/mass-effect/3030-16909/" data-ref-id="3030-16909">Mass Effect</a>. Bioware has made a toolset available for the creation of user content, much like it did for <a href="/neverwinter-nights/3030-9953/" data-ref-id="3030-9953">Neverwinter Nights</a>. The toolset is available for free to registered users of the PC version of Dragon Age: Origins.</p><h2>Origin Stories</h2><p style="">One of the major features of the game are the Origin Stories. Players are able to choose and play his or her own "Origin Story," which is the lens through which the entire game is seen and portrayed. The way the player's character sees the world and how the world sees their character is affected by the Origin Story. For example, players may begin the game as a Dwarf Noble and be a part of the Royal Family of a Dwarven City, or they could be a Dwarf Commoner living in the city's streets. These Origin Stories provide an introduction to the game and also help determine the overall direction of the story throughout the game. Characters the player meets during their Origin Story may reappear later on as either friends or enemies. Origin stories also provide the player with background information on the race they are playing. For example, when playing as an <a href="/elf/3015-537/" data-ref-id="3015-537">Elf</a>, players will quickly realize the prejudice the people of Ferelden show towards their race. Executive <a href="/dan-tudge/3040-69678/" data-ref-id="3040-69678">Dan Tudge</a> explained BioWare's perspective on the purpose of Origin stories, stating, "Really, the origin stories are more about your place and your perspective of how the world works."</p><h3>Elf Origins</h3><p style=""><b>Dalish Elf</b></p><p style="">As one of the last "true elves," you were content to spend your life wandering with your clan... until a chance encounter with a relic of your people's past threatens to tear you away from everything you've known.</p><p style="">While out in the Brecilian Forest with your childhood friend Tamlen, you run across three humans you have found an ancient relic in a nearby cave. You decide to go and check them out for yourselves and find the relic the humans were talking about which happens to be some kind of enchanted mirror. Tamlen's curiosity gets the best of him and decides to examine the mirror, which then emits some kind of magical energy and knocks the Dalish Elf unconscious. <a href="/duncan/3005-11652/" data-ref-id="3005-11652">Duncan</a> shows up in time and rescues the elf and returns you to the camp where you wake up two days later.</p><p style="">Having barely recovered from a fever, you decide to go back to the caves and looks for your friend Tamlen. Inside the cave you meet Duncan again and he informs you that the mirror is emitting some kind of <a href="/darkspawn/3015-4263/" data-ref-id="3015-4263">Darkspawn</a> taint which has infected you and is the cause of your fever. The only way for you to survive is to join the Grey Wardens whom can resist the taint and head to Ostagar so you can help Duncan defeat the Darkspawn.</p><p style=""><b>City Elf</b></p><p style="">The story of the city elf starts on a somewhat upbeat note. It’s a joyous day because there are not one, but two weddings going to be held that day, yours and Soris’. Both arranged, but important nonetheless, for the joining of these people ensures a strong continuation of the Elven bloodline. Or so you are told. Regardless of your sentiments towards this arrangement, today is the day that your life as a single man comes to an end.</p><p style="">Before you can get married to your betrothed, however, the festivities are rudely disturbed by Vaughan, the son of the Arl of Denerim. His interference does not last long, as Shianni sneaks up behind him and knocks him out with a wine bottle. Thinking that the day can now continue without further hindrance, the preparations for the wedding continue. But just as the wedding is about to truly start, Vaughan and his henchmen return.</p><p style="">At this point the experience differs slightly depending on whether you are playing a female or a male elf. If you are playing a male, you and Soris set out to rescue the women. When you get there, however, at least one of the women is killed, and Shianni has already been raped.</p><p style="">If you play as a female elf, you will get kidnapped along with the rest of the women. Just as you are about to be bound to be taken to Vaughan, Soris comes in and slides a sword to you. After slaying both guards, the rest plays out the same way as when playing a male elf.</p><p style="">When you return to the Alienage after successfully completing the rescue, the City Guards quickly catch wind of what went down at the estate and come looking for the ones responsible at the Alienage. You can either claim sole responsibility, or you can say that Soris helped you. Either way, your life is forfeit. But thankfully salvation comes thanks to <a href="/">Duncan</a>, a Grey Warden who has been visiting the Alienage to look for a new recruit. He invokes the right of conscription and recruits you into the ranks of the Grey Wardens. Between the joining the Grey Wardens and facing your death sentence, you find little choice but to join Duncan and embark on your new life as a Grey Warden.</p><h3>Dwarf Origins</h3><p style=""><b>Dwarf Commoner</b></p><p style="">The <a href="/">Dwarf</a> Commoner story takes place in the Dust district of <a href="/">Orzammar</a>, a section where the city's casteless are pretty much left to rot on their own. You start the game in service to Beraht, a dwarven crimelord who plans to marry your sister, Rica, to a dwarven noble. This act would elevate her and her family (Beraht of course considers himself 'family' in this case) above casteless status. Meanwhile, you are tasked to do his dirty work, which consists mainly of collecting on some debts and maybe cracking some skulls with your buddy Leske.</p><p style="">After doing said work, Beraht sends you to the Proving Grounds to rig the upcoming game by drugging one of the contestants. Whether you do this or not doesn't really matter since you invariably end up masquerading as one of the contestants. Of course you handily whoop all the other contestants but end up having to reveal yourself as a lowly 'brand' (a nickname for casteless, for they are all tattooed on the face). Chaos ensues and you and Leske are captured and end up in Beraht's dungeon, awaiting your fate. But as luck would have it, you escape.</p><p style="">After some <a href="/">dungeon crawling</a> you finally confront Beraht and kill him and his lackeys. You step out victorious and are greeted by a crow of people, including some guards and man named Duncan, who insists on recruiting you for the Grey Wardens after being impressed by your skills at the Proving. With your sister's blessing, you head out of Orzammar and the real quest begins.</p><h3>Dwarf Noble</h3><p style="">The favored child of the <a href="/">Dwarven</a> king, you proudly take up your first military command... only to learn that the deadly intrigues of dwarven politics and sibling rivalry pose an even greater danger than that faced on the battlefield. You are banished and must rely on your strength and cunning to get out of the mess your family has put you in.</p><h3>Mage Origin</h3><p style=""><b>Mage</b></p><p style="">Born with an aptitude for Magick, considered a dangerous curse by most, you have spent most of your life sequestered in the remote tower of the <a href="/">Circle of Magi</a> to be trained and contained under the close watch of the dreaded Templars. As the game begins, you face your final test before your ascent from apprenticeship to true Magedom: the Harrowing. You are instructed that you must enter the Fade, a parallel dimension from which a Mage draws his power to perform spells. It is revealed at this point that communing with the Fade is extremely dangerous as it is the domain of demons who are itching to posses an unsuspecting Mage and break out into the world of the living. Both First Enchanter Irving, the head of the Tower mages, and the Commander of the Templars in the tower, Gregoair, inform you of roughly what to expect from the test. You will enter the Fade, although your body will remain in the Tower, and will have to battle a demon.</p><p style="">If you succeed you will have proved yourself safe from the denizens of the Fade who would try to hi-jack your body and be allowed to continue studying inside the tower. If you fail the Templars who are charged with protecting regular folk from any demons who manage to cross from the Fade, will kill you. Also take too long and the Templars will kill you. They're not big on taking chances.Once you have entered the Fade the most harrowing thing you encounter are imprints of defeated demons named wisps. After wandering around in the Fade for a bit you encounter a talking mouse who claims to be another apprentice who took too long completing the Harrowing and no longer has a body to return to. While in the fade you may encounter a Sloth-Demon, a lethargic bear-like creature, and a spirit of Valour.</p><p style="">The demon will pose three riddles to you and if he receives three correct answers he will teach Mouse to take the form of a <a href="/">bear</a>. The Spirit of Valour will grant a weapon to any who best him in combat, or those who can persuade him to give it up.Once prepared you approach the Rage Demon you have been tasked to fight. In the ensuing conversation it becomes apparent Mouse has betrayed you to the demon yet he will help you fight if he knows the form of the bear. Once the Rage demon has been defeated Mouse attempts to convince you that you could help him get back to the land of the living. At this point you must confront him, Mouse is your true test and if you manage to see through his lies he will reveal his true form, although the camera stays on your character, and threaten you.The next scene sees your first awakening after the Harrowing.</p><p style="">Your friend, Jowan, who is still an apprentice has been sent to find you for the First Enchanter. Before you leave though Jowan voices his fears over his own Harrowing or lack thereof and believes he may be made tranquil. The Rite of Tranquility is performed on those Mages deemed not powerful enough to go through the Harrowing yet cannot be left unchecked, these Mages have all of their emotions, and magical potential removed and are set to do menial tasks around the Tower. After reassuring, or not, Jowan you make your way to the First Enchanters office, here you are introduced to Duncan, a recruiter for the Grey Wardens. He tells you of the suspected Blight in Ferelden and says that you have been picked to become a Warden. The First Enchanter asks you to show Duncan to his quarters so that the two of you may get to know one another better.</p><p style="">Once the mighty <a href="/">Grey Warden</a> has been escorted through the tower the player runs into Jowan once more.Jowan informs you that he has begun seeing someone, which is forbidden, a priestess named Lilly, which is even more forbidden. The young lovers inform you that the Circle of Mages believes that Jowan has been practicing Blood magic and plan to make him Tranquil. Jowan says that his slipping away to see Lily has been misconstrued and that now their only choice is to try and run away. However because the <a href="/">Chantry</a> keep blood samples of every Mage they would be unable to get very far before the Templars tracked them down.</p><p style="">They implore you to help them destroy Jowan's phylactery so that they are able to escape and live in peace.At this point the story can go two ways. Either you can betray the trust of Jowan and Lilly and take their plans to First Enchanter Irving. He will tell you to go along with the plan and destroy the phylactery so that he can catch Lilly red-handed and make certain she is punished. He want's to get back at the <a href="/">Chantry</a> any way he can. Or you may decide to take everything Jowan says at face value, more fool you, and help them any way. If you decide to inform on them then a few tasks must be completed before the phylactery can be destroyed. A Rod of Fire is needed from the store to break through the door to the phylactery chamber. however a signed note is needed from a Senior Enchanter before Owain, the Tranquil storekeeper will let you have it. So you must help out a fellow Mage in need to curry favor with her. She tells you spiders have gotten into the stockroom and asks you to help clear them out.</p><p style="">Once this is completed she will happily sign your note and you can get your hands on a rod of fire.In the Phylactery chamber things don't go exactly to plan. Using the Rod on the main door won't work due to magic dampening spells cast around he room. So you must take the long way round taking out animate suits of armour as you go.Eventually you reach the correct chamber and Jowan destroys his phylactery. at this point you can admit that you've betrayed him, or keep quiet until you run into Duncan, Greogair, Irving and a couple of guards.</p><p style="">Once he sees he's in trouble Jowan cuts his hand and uses his blood to amplify his magical potential, he casts a spell throwing everyone before him to the ground and runs away. Lilly is dragged off by the guards and you are left feeling rather guilty and glad Duncan is about to take you away to join the Grey Wardens.</p><h3>Human Origin</h3><p style=""><b>Human Noble</b></p><p style="">Born to wealth and power second only to royalty, you find your training in both diplomacy and war put to the test when your father's castle is betrayed from within on the very night your elder brother is to lead the family's forces to war. During this betrayal, you are charged with defending your family and home from certain destruction. The Human noble is the only class to begin the story with the Mabari Hound Companion.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Camera</h3><p style="">The camera moves along what has been described as a "J-Axis," referring to the way the camera zooms out and then up, forming a path that roughly resembles a letter 'J.' At its closest (the neck of the J), the camera gives an over-the-shoulder third person view of the action. Zooming out from there, the camera backs away from the character of focus for a progressively wider view. On the PC version, there is one additional level of zoom (the hook of the J), in which the camera jumps high off the ground, assuming an approximation of an isometric view of the battlefield, reminiscent of the fixed isometric view of <a href="/infinity-engine/3015-495/" data-ref-id="3015-495">Infinity Engine</a> games. In this pseudo-isometric view, the camera is not locked on to the currently selected character; instead, allowing free scrolling over the battlefield within a distance limit from the currently selected character.</p><h3><b>Combat</b></h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6731/286220-dragonage.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-286220" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.8" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6731/286220-dragonage.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-286220"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/6731/286220-dragonage.jpg"></a><figcaption>Traditional Isometric Camera Perspective</figcaption></figure><p style="">The combat functions like a traditional tactical party-based RPG, such as <a href="/baldurs-gate/3030-52/" data-ref-id="3030-52">Baldur's Gate</a>. The player controls a party of four characters at one time out of a pool of many more recruited characters. Each character is fully controllable and customizable, no less than the player's own created character.</p><p style="">Dragon Age: Origins uses the same "wheel" system for console versions as <a href="/mass-effect/3030-16909/" data-ref-id="3030-16909">Mass Effect</a>. Using spells and skills together in combos is necessary for success. One example of spells being used in combination is the use of a Grease spell to create a pool of grease which can then be lit on fire by a well placed Fireball spell. Separately, the spells only have specific uses and are not extremely effective. However, when used together, they can set large areas on fire and do damage to several enemies rather than just one like a Fireball spell would normally. Dragon Age: Origins also features boss battles against powerful enemies, like Ogres, which tower over the player's own characters. The ogre has a variety of unique abilities like a boulder throw and a grab ability that picks up a party member and repeatedly punches him until the other party members managed to knock him free from the ogre's hands. The battle ends with a gruesome execution animation where a party member knocks the ogre down to deliver the final blow.</p><h2>Races</h2><h3>Humans</h3><p style="">Although the dominant race within <a href="/thedas/3035-2495/" data-ref-id="3035-2495">Thedas</a>, the human race is divided over many reasons such as regional borders, cultural issues and of course political greed and gains. Among the many nations, three major human nations stand out in Dragon Age lore.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1230210-return_to_ostagar004.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1230210" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1230210-return_to_ostagar004.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1230210"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1230210-return_to_ostagar004.jpg"></a><figcaption>King Cailan Theirin</figcaption></figure><ul><li><a href="/ferelden/3035-2470/" data-ref-id="3035-2470"><b>Ferelden</b></a>: A land of conflict and strife, the people of Ferelden are ones who value the strength of independence and the bond of loyalty.

While the Blight was eventually defeated, the Tevinter Imperium was devastated and is now a shadow of its former glory.

The first conflict came in the form of the Tevinter Imperium invading the Elven homeland of Elvhenan, for perceived hostility. The result was a lasting effect of slavery of the elven people that is still practiced throughout the Tevinter. Later, the Elves claimed Dale as their homeland only to once again be subjected to aggression - this time by the <a href="/">Chantry</a>. The reason for this invasion remains unclear and is hotly debated. Regardless, the Elves were again displaced. As a result, the Dalish Elf and Alienage Elf came to be in the lands of Ferelden. The Alienage Elves live among humans, but segregated to squalor-ridden small communities, living in the poorest of conditions. This is contrasted by the Dalish Elves, who choose to remain nomadic, no doubt to separate themselves from human contact. Elves throughout Thedas are viewed as second-class citizens and are looked down upon.</p><h3>Dwarves</h3><p style="">Most people on the surface think of <a href="/">dwarves</a> and imagine greedy merchants or dour craftsmen, and certainly those are the faces most often seen by those of us who live under the Maker’s eye. But a journey to the thaig reveals a culture of nobility and of <a href="/">poverty</a>, of proud warriors and of necessary brutality. Much as the heat of the forge strengthens the blade, the dwarves have been hardened by the constant threat of the darkspawn onslaught, forcing their warriors to excel or die, their craftsmen to create masterpieces of durability and style, and their nobles to engage in a deadly political game of intrigue that shames the goings on in the simpler courts of <a href="/">Ferelden</a>. Everything done in Orzammar is done to fortify the remaining domains of the kingdom (of which there are, regrettably, few) against the relentless onslaught of the darkspawn.</p><h2>Classes</h2><p style="">The game features three base <a href="/classes/3015-405/" data-ref-id="3015-405">classes</a> with four specialization packages, unlockable over the course of the game, for each class.</p><h3>Warrior</h3><p style="">Available to all races (<a href="/human/3015-810/" data-ref-id="3015-810">Human</a>, <a href="/elf/3015-537/" data-ref-id="3015-537">Elf</a>, <a href="/dwarves/3015-940/" data-ref-id="3015-940">Dwarf</a>), the <a href="/warrior/3015-2646/" data-ref-id="3015-2646">Warrior class</a> has the following unique talents as well as being able to access all four weapon talent categories.</p><p style=""><b>Archery</b></p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6279/1196361-forestbattle.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1196361" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6279/1196361-forestbattle.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1196361"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/6279/1196361-forestbattle.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/6279/1196361-forestbattle.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Two-Handed Warriors focus on brute strength and pure offense</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Melee Archer, Aim, Defensive Fire, Master Archer</li></ul><ul><li>Pinning Shot, Crippling Shot, Critical Shot, Arrow of Slaying</li><li>Rapid Shot, Shattering Shot, Suppressing Fire, Scatter shot</li></ul><p style=""><b>Dual Weapons</b></p><ul><li>Dual Weapons Training, Dual Weapon Finesse, Dual Weapon Expert, Dual Weapon Mastery</li></ul><ul><li>Double Strike, Riposte, Cripple, Punisher</li></ul><ul><li>Dual Weapon Sweep, Flurry, Momentum, Whirlwind</li></ul><p style=""><b>Sword and Shield</b></p><ul><li>Shield Bash, Shield Pummel, Assault, Overpower</li></ul><ul><li>Shield Defense, Shield Balance, Shield Wall, Shield Expertise</li></ul><ul><li>Shield Block, Shield Cover, Shield Tactics, Shield Mastery</li></ul><p style=""><b>Two Handed</b></p><ul><li>Pommel Strike, Indomitable, Stunning Blows, Critical Strike</li><li>Sunder Weapon, Shattering Blows, Sunder Armor, Destroyer</li><li>Mighty Blow, Powerful Swings, Two-Handed Strength, Two-Handed Sweep</li></ul><p style=""><b>Warrior Class Talents</b></p><ul><li>Powerful, Threaten, Bravery, Death Blow</li><li>Precise Striking, Disengage, Taunt, Perfect Striking.</li></ul><p style=""><b>Specializations</b></p><ul><li>Berserker -

A wisp is a demon that has lost its power; either it has existed in our world for too long without finding a true host or it has been destroyed. What remains of its mind clings tightly to the one concept that created it—a hatred of all living things.<br />While its ability to target a living creature is limited these wisps often mindlessly attack when encountered in the Fade.

Their tactics are simple: attack an enemy on sight with as much force as possible until it perishes. Some rage demons carry over their heat-based abilities into possessed hosts, but otherwise the true form is mostly seen outside of the Fade when it is specifically summoned by a mage to do his bidding.</td></tr><tr><td><h3><b>Hunger Demon</b></h3> Main Article: <a href="/hunger-demon/3015-5057/" data-ref-id="3015-5057">Hunger Demon</a><br />A bit higher in the hierarchy of demons, they do little, but eat or attempt to eat everything they encounter, including other demons (this is rarely successful due to being near the bottom of the food chain).</td></tr><tr><td><h3><b>Sloth Demon</b></h3> Main Article: <a href="/sloth-demon/3015-4737/" data-ref-id="3015-4737">Sloth Demon</a><br />These are the first intelligent creatures one typically finds in <a href="/the-fade/3035-2661/" data-ref-id="3035-2661">the Fade</a>.

They cross the Veil and fight to possess creatures just not as much as other demons. Some are however slothful and knowingly cultivate such reputations (possibly due to ulterior motives). Demons of sloth are named so because this is the portion of the human psyche that they feed upon; doubt, apathy, and entropy. They seek to spread these things. The sloth demon hides in its forms, a master of shapes and disguises, and from its hiding place, it spreads its influence. A community afflicted by a demon of sloth could soon become a dilapidated pit where injustices are allowed to pass without comment, and none of the residents could be aware that such a change has even taken place. The sloth demon weakens, tires, and tears at the edges of consciousness and would much rather render its victim helpless than engage in a true conflict. Such creatures are best faced only with a great deal of will, and only with an eye to piercing their many disguises.<br />Although sloth demons are not high in the hierarchy of demons, some are powerful enough to bring creatures across the veil into the fade. They can trap many creatures in their own minds, lulled in blissful sloth.</td></tr><tr><td><h3><b>Desire Demon</b></h3> Main Article: <a href="/desire-demon/3015-4726/" data-ref-id="3015-4726">Desire Demon</a><br /><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/1226911-19_desire_demon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1226911" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/1226911-19_desire_demon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1226911"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22518/1226911-19_desire_demon.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22518/1226911-19_desire_demon.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Desire Demon</figcaption></figure> These are clever and far more powerful demons.

More than one group of templar have made the mistake of attempting to overwhelm a pride demon and suffered the consequences.

Perhaps there is some remnant of desire for vengeance upon the ones who goaded the magisters to assault heaven. Whatever the reason when darkspawn find one of these ancient dragons, it is immediately afflicted by the taint. It awakens twisted and corrupted, and leads the darkspawn in a full-scale invasion of the land: A Blight.<br /><b>Notable Arch Demons:</b><br /><ul><li>Dumat – <i>When the first Blight began, many brave men and women threw themselves at Dumat, the first archdemon, trying to strike him down.

The darkspawn were mindless, soulless, empty shells of flesh that could be formed and remade in the dragon’s image. However, a man’s soul was not so malleable. When a Gray Warden’s hand struck a fatal blow against Dumat, the old god’s spirit was drawn once again to the nearest tainted creature, not to a darkspawn but to the tainted man who had slain him. In that moment, the souls of both the Warden and the archdemon were utterly destroyed. And the dragon rose no more.

Part of an April Fools' Day promotion.</li><li><b>The Lucky Stone -</b> A bonus item that adds 1 to every stat when equipped. Acquired by uploading a character using the character creator on the BioWare social site. The item can be used on consoles, but the character creator is available only on PC.</li><li><b>Darkspawn Chronicles</b> - In this alternate canon downloadable content, the warden never survived the joining. You play as multiple darkspawn during the battle of Denerim. Darkspawn Chronicles places the player in the role of a Hurlock Vanguard, at the beginning of the siege of Denerim near the end of the Dragon Age: Origins game. The player is to lead the invasion, slaughtering all who should stand in your way.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Leliana's Song -</b> A short prequel story detailing Leliana's life as a Bard Spy before she became a Lay Sister in Lothering.</li><li><b>Golems of Amgarrak</b> <b>-</b> After receiving a letter from Jerrik Dace, requesting that the Warden come to Orzammar, to help Jerrik venture-forth into the Deep Roads in search of a missing dwarven expedition party including his younger brother. Face challenging encounters and puzzles that test the Warden's resolve, acquire new companions for this adventure to help you defeat a monstrous creature in this standalone adventure.</li><li><b>Witch Hunt</b> - This DLC takes place a year after the events of Origins proper. The player is able to import an Origins or Awakening character or begin with a fresh high level hero. This DLC is heavy on the spoiler side as it details the events of Morrigan's departure after the joining ceremony and the slaying of the Archdemon. In this journey the party consists of your hero, a Circle Magi named Finn, a Dalish warrior named Ariane, and your furry companion. At the time of its launch, the chapter contains a rather large bug where Morrigan herself is confused as to what the Grey Warden decided in regards to the Joining Ritual commonly refering to the child as your own then immediately berating you for refusing her proposal.</li></ul><h2>Dragon Age: The Alternate History</h2><p style="">The Dragon Age: Origins DLC, Darkspawn Chronicles, illustrates an alternate storyline in which the player character of the main Origins campaign dies during The Joining. The Darkspawn Chronicles DLC opens just as the darkspawn begin their invasion of Denerim, capital of Ferelden. As a Hurlock Vanguard, the player fights their way through Denerim's defenders and civilians, eventually arriving at the Archdemon to help defend it from Alistair.</p><p style="">The events of Darkspawn Chronicles, which coincide with the Origins events from The Joining up until the attack on Denerim, differ slightly from the main campaign, illustrating which choices Alistair would have made throughout his travels as the last of the Grey Wardens. This includes enlisting the major factions as allies, and choosing which party members accompany him.</p><h3>Alistair's Party</h3><p style="">When battling against Alistair, he is equipped with Templar armor, a one handed mace, and Duncan's shield. While still a Grey Warden commander, Alistair also takes up the position of King with Anora as Queen. Morrigan is among the leading party, though is still at constant odds with Alistair. It is unlikely that she offered to either sleep with Alistair in order to save his life, were he to manage to kill the Archdemon, or asked his help in disposing of Flemeth.</p><p style="">Leliana is also a member of Alistair's primary party, still wearing her Lay Sister garments; it is suggested that Alistair and Leliana shared a romance. The Mabari hound was rescued from Ostagar and treated by Alistair, eventually imprinting himself upon his rescuer. Alistair and the hound were said to have been inseparable through Alistair's travels. Alistair dubbed the hound Barkspawn as an obvious pun regarding the Darkspawn.</p><h3>The Other Characters</h3><p style="">Most of the possible party members weren't recruited by Alistair, and instead found themselves defending Denerim by their own paths or sheer chance. Wynne, the only other character who joined Alistairs party, is found in the market district with a small band of Templars instead of at Alistair's side against the Archdemon.</p><p style="">Wynne joined Alistair to help defend against the blight, despite being the only remaining Circle Mage. Sten did not succumb to the darkspawn invasion of Lothering, but also did not join Alistair. Instead he traveled alone to answer the singular question, "What is a Blight?". Over time, he came to Denerim to aid in the fight against the darkspawn invasion. Sten is equipped with his sword, which he must have managed to find on his own.</p><p style="">Zevran, still assigned to kill any surviving Wardens by order of Loghain, encountered and was beaten by Alistair in the same fashion as can be seen in the Origins campaign. Alistair allows him to live and orders him to flee, warning Zevran to never hunt for him again. Zevran is encountered in Denerim only by chance as he was seeking refuge in the Alienage from the Antivan Crows.</p><p style="">Oghren, much like Zevran, only found himself at Denerim during its destruction by chance. Alistair did not agree to help find Branka in the deep roads, and Oghren was eventually exiled under charges for his drunken disorderly behavior. As an exile, he spent his days drowning himself at the Denerim bar. The darkspawn fight against him and a small band of drunks, in the market district.</p><p style="">Shale is not encountered during Darkspawn Chronicles. She most likely remains in Honleath either unencountered, or was barred by Alistair from joining the party. Loghain's fate is not shown, though under Alistair's judgement it's highly likely that he was executed for his crimes rather than being recruited into  the Wardens.</p><h3>Alistair's Decisions</h3><p style="">Based upon what factions are present during the battle of Denerim, Alistair was faced with many, if not all, of the same decisions to make as the Origins player character. Which choices can be proven through his allies in Denerim although most is to be assumed judging by Alistair's personality.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p style="">There is nothing to indicate which origin story applies to the Darkspawn Chronicles. It is instead left to the imagination of the player.</p><h3>Ostagar</h3><p style="">The same exact events occur at Ostagar. Loghain leaves Duncan and the Grey Wardens, as well as King Cailan and his forces, to be slaughtered by the advancing darkspawn. All events up to that point are the same as the Origins campaign, up until the joining, at which point the Origins Hero dies along with Daveth and Ser Jory.</p><p style="">Alistair would have had to have been the one to save the ill Mabari Hound, since the hound joins him on his travels. He fought his way through the Tower of Ishal to light the signal with no Warden assistance, though it is likely that he was assisted by soldiers in the vicinity of the tower. After being overwhelmed by the darkspawn on the top floor of the tower of Ishal, Alistair is saved by Flemeth, and Morrigan was forced to join him on his journey. Alistair then found the hound on the path to Lothering with Morrigan, and accepted it as his companion.</p><h3>Lothering</h3><p style="">Similar events transpire with Alistair's lead. Leliana joins the party and Sten is freed, though does not join Alistair's group.</p><h3>Brecilian forest and the Dalish Elves</h3><p style="">Based upon the presence of werewolves during the attack on Denerim, it is likely that the Dalish Elves were wiped out by them. There is no evidence as to whether or not Alistair assisted the Dalish Elves.</p><h3>The Circle Tower</h3><p style="">Wynne is shown to have survived the brutality inflicted by the abominations, however the Templar's presence defending Denerim suggests that no other Circle Mages survived the disaster.</p><h3>Orzammar and the Dwarves</h3><p style="">While it isn't shown for certain who was made King, between Harrowmont or Prince Bhelen, the Anvil of the Void must have been kept, as Golems also make up a part of the resistance in Denerim.</p><h3>Arl Eamon and Redcliffe</h3><p style="">While Bann Teagan is found in Denerim, his brother Eamon isn't, suggesting that he was not healed of his sickness. Jowan was unlikely to have been released, but Alistair may have used his blood magic to sacrifice Eamon's wife Isolde to fight against the demon that possesses Eamon's son Connor in the Fade. This is based upon the assumption that the Circle of Mages was destroyed.</p><h3>The Urn of Sacred Ashes</h3><p style="">Based upon the assumption that Eamon was not healed of his illness, it is unlikely that Alistair pursued The Urn of Sacred Ashes.</p><h3>The Landsmeet</h3><p style="">With Alistair's lack of tact, and based upon the assumption that he could not rely upon the experience of Arl Eamon, it can be deduced that he wasn't able to convince the nobles to aid him, and may well have simply looked like he was trying to steal the throne. Loghain was also likely executed after dueling with Alistair.</p><h2>Sexual Themes</h2><p style="">After <a href="/mass-effect/3030-16909/" data-ref-id="3030-16909">Mass Effect</a> made a well-known, controversial appearance on Fox News for its "sex scenes", some people were wondering what Dragon Age: Origins would feature in that category. Due to some early trailers, it was evident that there would be some scenes of a suggestive nature. In late July of 2009, the ESRB released their description of Dragon Age's sexual content:</p><blockquote><p style="">During the course of the game, players are able to visit a brothel where a hostess asks what they are interested in. If players select "Surprise me," they can sometimes wind up face-to-face with a woman, a man, a transsexual, or an animal; sexual activity is never depicted during these brothel encounters. Players can also initiate brief cutscene sequences in which couples (male and female or same sex couples) can be depicted kissing, embracing, and caressing one another as the screen fades to black. Though the game never features human nudity, one female demon character is briefly depicted with bare breasts.</p></blockquote><p style="">While it has yet to be seen if any controversy will come of the game's mature themes, David Gaider (Lead Writer for Dragon Age: Origins) has personally said there is no bestiality in the game. This puts at suspect what conclusions people may draw from the very dry text of ESRB's summary of Dragon Age: Origin's content.</p><h2>Character Creator</h2><p style="">Released on October 13th, DA:O's character creation tool allowed PC players to create their character before the full game was released. The character could then be uploaded to the BioWare social site, awarding the player an in-game item.</p><p style="">By looking through the files of the character creator several files revealed "spoiler" type information such as talents, specializations, and codex entries that the developers subsequently cautioned players to avoid in case the player wished not to ruin some parts of the game's story.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p style="">The music for Dragon Age: Origins was composed by <a href="/inon-zur/3040-46828/" data-ref-id="3040-46828">Inon Zür</a>.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Track No.</th><th>Title</th><th>Running Time</th></tr><tr><td>01</td><td>Dragon Age: Origins</td><td>02.49</td></tr><tr><td>02</td><td>I Am the One (High Fantasy version)</td><td>04.03</td></tr><tr><td>03</td><td>The Chantries Hubris</td><td>03.16</td></tr><tr><td>04</td><td>Elves at the Mercy of Man</td><td>01.21</td></tr><tr><td>05</td><td>The Dwarven Nobles</td><td>01.07</td></tr><tr><td>06</td><td>Mages In Their Chantry</td><td>02.01</td></tr><tr><td>07</td><td>The Common Dwarf</td><td>01.24</td></tr><tr><td>08</td><td>The Dalish</td><td>01.18</td></tr><tr><td>09</td><td>Human Nobility</td><td>01.21</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Ruins of Ostagar</td><td>01.18</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Enter the Kocari Wilds</td><td>01.06</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Darkspawn In the Wilds</td><td>01.13</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Join the Grey Wardens</td><td>01.53</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>The Betrayal</td><td>03.01</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>The Party Camp</td><td>00.44</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>Battle the Darkspawn Hordes</td><td>01.05</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>The Endless Wave of Hurlocks</td><td>01.06</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>The Dalish Elves Encampment</td><td>01.18</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>Urn of Sacred Ashes</td><td>01.01</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>Haven!</td><td>01.07</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>Battle for the Urn</td><td>01.06</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>Attack On Denerim</td><td>01.06</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>The Dungeons of Landsmeet</td><td>01.12</td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td>Dungeons and Dungeons</td><td>01.13</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>Howe</td><td>01.08</td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td>The Battle of Lothering Village</td><td>02.18</td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td>Ferelden at War</td><td>02.57</td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td>Lelianna's Song</td><td>02.33</td></tr><tr><td>29</td><td>King Edrin</td><td>01.31</td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td>The Deep Roads</td><td>01.20</td></tr><tr><td>31</td><td>Battle the Blight</td><td>01.05</td></tr><tr><td>32</td><td>To Kill an Ogre</td><td>03.09</td></tr><tr><td>33</td><td>Challenge an Arch Demon</td><td>03.12</td></tr><tr><td>34</td><td>The Coronation</td><td>01.03</td></tr><tr><td>35</td><td>I Am the One (Dark Fantasy version)</td><td>04.09</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Novels</h3><p style="">There are currently two novels set in the <i>Dragon Age</i> universe.

and engage in World War III.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2> <b>Prologue Events</b> </h2>  The events lending up to EndWar begin with the signing of the SLAMS (Space-Land-Air Missile Shield) Treaty in 2011. This treaty between the United States and the European Union allowed for the co-operative development of anti-ballistic technologies and systems. This meant that any Intercontinental ballistic missile launched  could be destroyed. The shield was activated in 2014; Russia however, having been left out of the treaty, began accelerating their development for a similar system.   <br/><br/>Tensions between the superpowers grew, until in 2015, when oil reserves started to run dry and the world was plunged into an energy crisis. This was followed by a nuclear war between and in 2016, lasting 5 hours,  leaving 20 million dead, and destroying the oil-rich countries of Saudi Arabia and Iran. This left Russia as the world’s biggest supplier of natural gases and crude oil. With this surge in the economy, Russia invests billions in the biggest arms build up since the cold war. To prevent another nuclear war, in 2017, the USA and Europe deploy a space-based missile shield, which was quickly countered by Russia’s advanced missile defense system. This rendered all ICBMs useless.  These events forced the EU to form a singular political, economic and military power, named the European Federation (2018.) The most notable exceptions are Britain and Switzerland , who declined membership. This formation creates a superpower, which power rivals both the Russians and the Americans, causing fracture in relations with the USA. <br/><br/> The same year, the USA announced its plans for a high orbiting space station, the ‘Freedom Star,’ to be in orbit by 2020. This station would allow them to deploy Marines anywhere on the globe in 90 minutes. This project is met with extremely negative reaction, with the EF particularly objecting, as the development would bring an imbalance of power. With relations completely broken, EF withdraws from NATO in protest, however the continues with the program. In 2020, the final module of the Freedom Star is attacked on its launch pad, forcing the rising tensions between the three superpowers to breaking point, and the beginning of the Endwar.<br/> <br/> <h2>Gameplay</h2>EndWar is a real-time strategy game that deviates from the genre's PC-oriented conventions in the interest of streamlining its gameplay on console controls. As <figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1590/296865-end1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-296865" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.56181318681319" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1590/296865-end1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-296865"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1590/296865-end1.jpg"></a><figcaption>JSF Command Vehicle and Combat Drones</figcaption></figure>such, the player doesn't view the action from the traditional overhead perspective and move a free mouse-like cursor over the battlefield. Instead, the camera is situated much closer to battlefield-level, and the player cycles the focus from one selected group of units to the next at the touch of a button. The game contains an optional voice-activated interface that allows the player to control all game functions -- selecting units, coordinating attacks, and the like -- entirely with spoken commands.  There is an initial set up of the voice commands early in the game, which only takes a couple of minutes.  The voice commands work well most of the time if the orders are said competently, but the game recognizes many commands even when not said perfectly.<br/><br/>Battles begin with usually 2 to 3 units selected during the mission briefing stage of the battle deployed to the battlefield.  Sometimes the player gets 8 from the start.  Players then rush to control uplink sites throughout the map.  Each uplink will grant additional strategic points and they can also be upgraded to allow support abilities or to add defensive drones to uplink sites.  These points can either be used to request reinforcements or battlefield aids such as air strikes or EMP strikes.  As units take damage in battle their health and shields decrease until both are below 25%, once units reach this critical state their shields are instantly boosted to 100% and a heavy transport helicopter is called in to evacuate the unit.  Units in this state pose no further threat to enemy forces and can be safely ignored.   As the battle progresses both sides victory battle bar increases with each unit destroyed or <figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/18620/971666-wmd_1680x1050.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-971666" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/18620/971666-wmd_1680x1050.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-971666"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/18620/971666-wmd_1680x1050.jpg"></a><figcaption>Laser-strike WMD</figcaption></figure> uplink captured until the End War phase is reached.  Once this happens reinforcements and support powers become much cheaper along with the loser gaining the WMD ability, however once it is used the winning faction also gets their WMD ability, meaning that choosing to not use the ability at all may be a better strategy.<br/><br/><h3>Mission Support</h3>There are a number of mission supports that can be used by players to bring a specific military support to the battlefield to aid the player.  They must be purchased in the barracks.  Most require at least 1 upgraded uplink.<br/><ul class="plain-list"><li>Force Recon:  Calls in reinforcements to protect an uplink.</li> <li>Air Strikes:  Two uplinks are required for a level 2 airstrike upgrade that gives an area of effect.  Airstrikes cost 4 command points.  They can be disabled by a successful Electronic Warfare use by the other side.  An airstrike calls in jets to attack an enemy or area.</li> <li>Electronic Warfare:  This support disables vehicles for a short time and removes their shields until it wears off.  With a level 2 of this, it allows an area of effect. <br/></li> </ul><br/><h3>Mission Report</h3>The player gets an after-action report at the end of each match.  From there the results for each unit can be seen, as either survived, killed in action, or promoted.  Each battle gives a command rating based on how well the player performed in a percent grade.  Funds earned are shown in the report, which vary depending on command rating, player experience, and map bonuses.  Mission Support requests, medals,  awards, and mission results compared to the players faction are shown as well.<br/> <br/> <h2>Factions</h2> <h3>Russian Spetsnaz Guards Brigade</h3> <figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14144/475071-theme2_blade4_sgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-475071" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.68823529411765" data-width="340" style="width: 340px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:68.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14144/475071-theme2_blade4_sgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-475071"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14144/475071-theme2_blade4_sgb.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14144/475071-theme2_blade4_sgb.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Russian Spetsnaz Guards Brigade</figcaption></figure>As part of the military and arms build up, the Spetsnaz were modernized with modifications to existing technology and systems. Everything from weaponry to vehicles was modified to suit, resulting in standard-issue equipment being worked beyond their original capabilities. Its ranks are composed of hardened veterans from other conflicts, trained and specialized in heavy weapons and armor. Comparatively, the Spetsnaz are the toughest armed forced to deal with, relying on superior firepower and heavier armor to always overcome the enemy.  <br/> <h3><br/></h3> <h3>European Federation Enforcers Corps</h3> In response to the increasing threat presented by both the US and Russia, the EF formed the Enforcer Corps. The Enforcers are a collection of high-skilled and trained counter-terrorist and peacekeeper forces, selected from across Europe’s elite forces; with the most notable being members from the Rainbow Six counter-terrorist unit. With specializations in urban warfare, the Enforcers utilize a combination of electronic and energy weaponry, as well as the fastest vehicles of any force. <br/> <h3><br/></h3> <h3>Unites States’ Joint Strike Force</h3> With the completion of the controversial Freedom Star impending; the United States uses the Joint Strike Force for their military operations. Based on the Marine Expeditionary Units, the JSF is renowned for its implementation of integration technologies, combining air and ground combat capacities. The JSF use state-of-the-art technologies, such as stealth and robotics, to allow for specializations in rapid deployment and highly accurate weaponry. This force is led by Scott Mitchell, of the Ghost Recon squad.<br/><br/> <h2>Units</h2>  Units in Endwar consist of: Command Vehicle, Gunships, Artillery, Tanks, Combat Transports, Riflemen and Engineers. Each unit is balanced so that all are of equal value. This means that one unit of tanks is not more powerful than a unit of Riflemen. This places the emphases on using the units effectively as well as knowing the strengths and weakness of each unit. Endwar has one combat triangle: Tanks are weak against Gunships, where as Gunships are weak against Combat Transports; Combat Transports are weak against Tanks.<br/><br/>  Units are reinforced by mission supports, such as air strikes, deep strikes and EMP blasts. This far supports are gained by the capture and upgrading of critical points on the map. Super weapons can also be used, which each factor having their own unique WMD. The JSF have a Kinetic Strike, the Enforcer Corps have an Orbital Laser Strike , whilst the Russian’s use a Nuclear Warhead. <br/> <br/> <h3><b>Customization and Upgrading</b></h3><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14144/476224-endw_nextgen_screenshot_jsf_barracks_transports.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-476224" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14144/476224-endw_nextgen_screenshot_jsf_barracks_transports.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-476224"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14144/476224-endw_nextgen_screenshot_jsf_barracks_transports.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14144/476224-endw_nextgen_screenshot_jsf_barracks_transports.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Barracks- Upgrading a JSF Combat Transport</figcaption></figure>  At a start of a game, the player must choose a battalion. Each battalion has a different specialization and units, such as airborne, mechanized, armored, signals, or assault. The type of battalion determines  the type of bonuses that units can use. For example, Airborne Gunships immediately have access to a rocket barrage that deals both ‘kinetic damage’ and ‘blast damage.’ Each unit also has their own persistent experience, which carries over from each battle. There are up to six levels of experience, each increasing the effectiveness of the unit. However, if the unit is killed in action, the unit and experience is lost. To prevent losing units in an unbeatable situation, the unit can retreat.  <br/><br/> The battalion can further be customized in the barracks. From here, the player can customize the motto, heraldry and even battle camouflage, as well as purchase upgrades for each unit. These upgrades are purchased with CR (gained through each successful battle), which range from increased armor for tanks, to sniper rifles for riflemen, to anti-air rail guns for transports. Each factor has around 150 upgrades. <br/> <h3>Changing Battalions</h3><br/> During the campaign it is possible to change the battalion you are a part of.  This will allow you to choose a battalion with different bonuses and squad numbers, this means that purchased upgrades and credits will be kept but unit's experience will be lost.  You are also able to change which faction you are a part of, however by doing this all unit upgrades, experience and credits are lost.<br/><br/> <h2>Demo, Beta, and "VIP Demo"<br/></h2>  On October 16 a demo came out on Xbox Live for Tom Clancy's Endwar. The demo is over one gigabyte in size and one map available for singleplayer or multiplayer 1v1 use. The demo also features standard voice commands . It is currently available everywhere worldwide except Switzerland.<br/><br/>A beta version of the game was tested between June 16 and July 9, 2008. This was only available to Xbox Live Gold users and contained three maps in both 1v1 and 2v2 match variants. Participants were asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement for the beta. After the conclusion of the beta,  Michael de Plater posted on a development blog and thanked the players for their participation. He also provided a ‘Post-Beta Round Up,' which commented on various aspects of the beta. It was stated that the build used for the beta was older and ‘<i>much worse than you want the final game to be.</i>’ It was also said that every unit has been tweaked and balanced from the beta feedback. <br/><br/>A "VIP demo"(also known as stress test), was due to start mid-September. Participants were required to have pre-ordered the game and obtained an 'Enlistment code' to access the test. But after being dela yed, it was finally released on October 10, only 5 days before the official demo was released.<br/><br/><h2>Theater of War</h2> The Theater of War is the online massive multiplayer component of the game that much of the focus has been on since the games launch, much as Halo 3.  As such, it has been tweaked several times to improve gameplay.  Occasionally the developers have modified the map to move the pace.  During the first battle, the conditions were lowered for winning, to prevent it from going on too long.  The use of this feature has been important as wait times for matches have been long in the past due to less players and an imbalance in gamers per faction, mainly too many in the Joint Strike Forces (JSF).  As more players have joined the battle, possibly due to Christmas sales of the game, as well more sales generally since launch, wait times have been reduced.  However there are still periods of relatively long waits during certain times of the day, usually peak business hours in the United States.<br/><br/>Ubisoft has a page on their homepage updated daily with the Theater of War that shows the current state of the war at <a href="http://endwargame.us.ubi.com/tow.php" rel="nofollow">     endwargame.us.ubi.com/tow.php</a>.<br/><br/> <h2>Escalation Pack DLC</h2><br/>On Dec 11, 2008, the Escalation Pack was released for Endwar as DLC.  It included 4 new missions on new battlefields, one unit upgrade per faction, and new achievements for the 360, and new trophies for the PS3.   The new missions include the Siege of the Kursk Firebase (Ukraine), the Assault on Devon beach (England), the Raid on Rota naval base (Spain) and the Conquest of Dorsey Knob (USA, West Virginia). <br/><br/>A title update was released the same day that added the option of 4 v 4 battles online.  Previously only 1 v 1 and 2 v 2 were available.  Also fixed was the glitch that allowed players to quit and not lose progress.  Now if players quit, if units have been killed in a match, they will be moved down to regular units.  This was implemented to discourage gamers from quitting games just because some of their downed units were killed off.<br/> <br/><h2>Behind the Scenes/Making of<br/></h2><br/>In an interview with strategy podcast Three Moves Ahead,  Ubisoft’s Michael de Plater discussed the making of EndWar.  He detailed the inspiration behind the game, the challenges of making a console RTS and what goals his team had for the game.  There is also some talk of what they are going to change in an attempt to improve upon the sequel.

The main race modes are circuit racing, sprint races, elimination, time trials and a new highway battle mode. Highway Battle mode is the only mode where a player's car can be totalled. Players have to win races to earn money for various car upgrades, which can be either aesthetic or performance enhancing. They also have to win races and challenges to move forward in the story. Police pursuits once again are based on the player's heat level. The higher the heat level, the tougher the cops get. The Tri-City Police Department consists of regular cop cars, SUV's, helicopters and police cars derived from high performance cars. They will employ tactics such as setting up roadblocks, spike strips, and the PIT manoeuvre. <br/> <br/>This instalment of Need for Speed also introduces a levelling system. At the end of a race or event, the player profile has several driving characteristics that experience points are added onto. These different characteristics include braking, top speed and handling. When these skills or characteristics are levelled up, a slightly noticeable increase in performance is seen in all cars the player drives.<br/> <br/>The multiplayer component of the game includes several game modes: <br/><ul class="plain-list"><li>Circuit - A race mode where players have to race each other in a lapped race</li><li>Sprint - A race mode where players race from a starting point to a finishing point</li><li>Cops N' Robbers - A game mode where two teams of four either have to deliver or stop the delivery of an item</li><li>The Heist - A game mode where players have to steal cash and evade the police<br/></li></ul> <br/><h2>Plot<br/></h2> <figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4938/591412-nfsucfmv2gu4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-591412" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:50.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4938/591412-nfsucfmv2gu4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-591412"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4938/591412-nfsucfmv2gu4.jpg"></a><figcaption> A member of Tri-City's Underground</figcaption></figure>     Need for Speed: Undercover takes place in Tri-City, which consists of four distinct boroughs. These are Palm Harbor, Sunset Hills, Port Crescent and Gold Coast Mountains. The game begins with the player, an undercover police officer in the police    department's street racing unit, evading cops on the interstate.

Tri-City is currently a major hotbed of illegal street racing and car smuggling. The player is tasked with infiltrating the criminal underground in order to take down the criminal kingpins. Starting out in the borough of Palm Harbor, the player has to earn the confidence of the local crime boss by stealing and delivering different cars. Once that is done, the player can move onto the other three boroughs to work for other members of the criminal underground, eventually reaching a point where the player can break the case wide open and culminates in a final car chase throughout the Tri-City area.<br/> <br/><h2>Car List<br/></h2> <ul class="plain-list"><li>2006 Aston Martin DB9</li> <li>2008 Audi R8</li> <li>2007 Audi TT</li>

<a href="/third-person-perspective/3015-464/" data-ref-id="3015-464">third-person</a> action-adventure sandbox game developed by <a href="/avalanche-studios/3010-5927/" data-ref-id="3010-5927">Avalanche Studios</a> and published by <a href="/eidos-interactive/3010-658/" data-ref-id="3010-658">Eidos Interactive</a> and <a href="/square-enix-ltd/3010-6492/" data-ref-id="3010-6492">Square Enix.</a> The player takes the role of <a href="/rico-rodriguez/3005-1867/" data-ref-id="3005-1867">Rico Rodriguez</a>, an agent of the US government posing as a mercenary, as he takes jobs and tasks for the various rival factions on Panau, a fictitious island nation in Southeast Asia ruled by the dictator Pandak "Baby" Panay". Players can perform over-the-top stunts by combining the <a href="/grapple/3055-5/" data-ref-id="3055-5">grappling hook</a>, the <a href="/parachute/3055-504/" data-ref-id="3055-504">parachute</a>, and the "<a href="/stunt-position/3015-65/" data-ref-id="3015-65">Stunt Position</a>" system that allows you to mount different areas of the vehicles in the game.</p><p style="">The game was originally slated for release in late 2008; however, it was later announced in October of that year that the game would be pushed back to 2009. Since then, the game was delayed once again to its final release date of March 23, 2010.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style="">Protagonist Rico Rodriguez, an Agency operative, is sent to Panau to find Rico's former commanding officer and friend, Tom Sheldon. Tom is accused of stealing top-secret intel and millions of dollars from the Agency. Recently taken over by Baby Panay, a ruthless dictator, Panau is a violent place.The island features three rival factions: The Ular Boys, The Reapers, and The Roaches. Rico must work with these factions to gain information through helping them in their individual struggles. By completing faction missions and causing "chaos", Rico uncovers information that leads to Sheldon being absolved from his crimes as the plot shifts to a suspicious international interest in the small nation of Panau. Eventually, it is discovered that the island features a great wealth of oil. In the final mission, Baby Panay launches nuclear missiles at the nations attempting to steal his country's oil stash. Rico defuses all but one of the missiles, rerouting it, along with Baby Panay, to destroy the oil and end international interest in Panau. </p><h2>New Features</h2><ul><li>The game uses the Avalanche 2.0 engine, improving upon the engine from the <a href="/just-cause/3030-18163/" data-ref-id="3030-18163">first game</a>.</li><li>The <a href="/artificial-intelligence/3015-218/" data-ref-id="3015-218">AI</a> has been rewritten to use a planning system to use the environment to their advantage, take cover and avoid damage.</li><li>The aiming system has been revamped. A new hybrid system allows the player to lock on and fire at enemies while still controlling the cross-hair. Additionally, it is now possible to target specific body parts for appropriate effects (i.e. head shots do heavy damage, knee shots cripple and slow movement).</li><li>A new adaptive difficulty system, making the game react on the player's successes and failures. For example, causing general chaos successfully causes the government faction to heighten security by adding more guards at important locations.</li><li>New vehicles have been added, including a jumbo jet.</li><li>Each vehicle now controls somewhat differently. Land vehicles will also take into account the type of terrain the player is traversing: certain vehicles will fare better or worse on different sorts of terrain (such as a sports car doing well on flat asphalt, but poorly off-road).</li><li>Vehicles deform more realistically in real-time, allowing individual parts to break or come loose.</li><li>Several new weapons have been added, such as a rocket launcher with laser-guided rockets, a one-handed grenade launcher, sticky remote-triggered C4, and a detachable mounted mini-gun.</li><li>On the <a href="/playstation-3/3045-35/" data-ref-id="3045-35">Playstation 3</a>, players have the ability to record their exploits. The game automatically records the last 30 seconds of gameplay by default (though this can be disabled); alternatively, the game can be manually set to record a sequence of up to 10 minutes. The resulting video can either be saved to the PS3's hard drive or directly uploaded to YouTube.</li><li>The grappling hook no longer has to be selected like a weapon allowing you to use it in conjunction with the parachute to traverse the environment very quickly.</li></ul><h2>Setting</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1048502-justcause2_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1048502" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1048502-justcause2_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1048502"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1048/1048502-justcause2_01.jpg"></a><figcaption>A common sight while skydiving</figcaption></figure><p style="">The game is set on a fictional island in Southeast Asia called Panau, situated in the Malay Archipelago. The island features varied terrain, including snowy mountains, deserts, jungles, cities, and beaches, all of which the player is free to traverse. The back of the box claims that the island is 400 sq miles (making it the second largest open world game with FUEL being the first) although this is debatable.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><ul><li><b>Happy Bubble Blaster:</b> A easter egg weapon.

Visiting the island will cause darkened skies and rain, and if the player is flying an airplane, it will burst into flames. On one section of the beach the word "search" can be seen spelled out in the ground with wooden planks, as well as a crashed plane (Coordinates 1274X 3668Y). The <a href="/the-lost-hatch/3035-2826/" data-ref-id="3035-2826">hatch</a> can also be found, at coordinates 29584X 4363Y. Although a lot of this is explained in game in a mission provided by the Ular boys, the reference is too clear to be just coincidence. Also, once the mission is completed, all the weather phenomenon and plane explosions will no longer occur.</p><p style="">The island is inhabited by an army of 100 year old Japanese soldiers, who never found out the war was over. It is a reference to a real post-second world war myth, that enclaves of elite Japanese Soldiers remained in the deep jungles of the many pacific islands that remained untouched by the allies. Supposedly they had been ordered to keep on the fight for the empire even after the bombs were dropped. This combined with the various real life experimentation programs started by Japan's military during the war make Lost Island one of the most eerie sites in all of Just Cause.</p><h3>Inland Shipwreck</h3><p style="">Located at coordinates 10387X 23520Y. Not much to see here apart from well, an inland ship wreck (on a mountain). Surrounded by a small town (not marked on map) which contains some valuable crates.</p><h3>Cape Canaveral</h3><p style="">Located at coordinates 30172X 14068Y is a replica of the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, a famous rocket launch facility on the coast of Florida.</p><h3>Arecibo Observatory</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31859/1313784-screenshot_229018.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1313784" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.56470588235294" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31859/1313784-screenshot_229018.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1313784"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/31859/1313784-screenshot_229018.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/31859/1313784-screenshot_229018.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Arecibo Observatory</figcaption></figure><p style="">Located at coordinates 23440X 17420Y is the military base PAN MILSAT. This is in fact a replica of Puerto Rico's Arecibo Observatory, a massive radio telescope that many will recognize from its appearance in the James Bond film <i>Goldeneye</i>.</p><h3>I Am Legend</h3><p style="">Located at coordinates 18207X 21543Y, at the end of a pier, there is a desk and a chair that appear to be a reference to the Will Smith movie, <i>I Am Legend</i>.</p><h3>Happy Bubble Blaster</h3><p style="">Located at coordinates 4265X 26020Y, atop a bell tower in a tranquil grove, is a secret weapon named the Happy Bubble Blaster. The Happy Bubble Blaster fires soap bubbles at an automatic weapon rate, and uses the same ammunition as the MP5.</p><h3>Hot Air balloon</h3><p style="">Located at coordinates 7392X 16151Y next to the side of a hill. The hot air balloon can be used by shooting/hitting the sandbags off, jumping into the basket and then lighting the burner by pressing the "enter vehicle button". Once in the air the hot air balloon can be controlled by walking into the sides of the basket.</p><h3>Beached Whale</h3><p style="">Located at coordinates 29611X 31332Y. The whale can be destroyed allowing you access to a armor crate.</p><h3>A shark?</h3><p style="">Located at coordinates 12730X 22494Y this shark isn't all that it seems.......(It's fake)</p><h3>Snowman</h3><p style="">Located at coordinates 23745X 13662Y. Rico is able to talk to the snowman but sadly only two sentences.</p><h3>Baby Panay billboard fun</h3><p style="">Next time you see a Baby Panay billboard try grapple onto his face and press the "enter vehicle button".</p><h3>Banana Fail</h3><p style="">Located at coordinates 21902X 20264Y. On the ground you should see the words "banana fail" spelled out. However, you'll have to look closely because of long grass.</p><h3>Surprised smiley face :O</h3><p style="">Located at coordinates 29110X 7392Y. Only viewable from above is a large surprised smiley face dug into the ground.</p><h3>Skull Island</h3><p style="">Located on the horseshoe island in the center of the map is a skull. Best viewed from the air in a helicopter/jet. The skull is on the front of the island on the front. It is, presumably a reference to King Kong.</p><h2>Pre-Order Bonus Content</h2><p style="">Pre-ordering Just Cause 2 granted access to various pieces of downloadable content depending on the retailer, including:</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/1331475-chaosparachutegb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1331475" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.599609375" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:60.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/1331475-chaosparachutegb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1331475"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/30036/1331475-chaosparachutegb.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/30036/1331475-chaosparachutegb.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Chaos Parachute</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Agency Hovercraft</li><li>Monster Truck</li><li>Chevalier Classic</li><li>Rico's Signature Gun</li><li>Bulls Eye Assault Rifle</li><li>Specially Designed Chaos Parachute</li></ul><p style="">Those who pre-ordered the game in the US were restricted to the piece of content that their chosen retailer offered; customers outside the US, however, could obtain all of the bonus content no matter with which retailer they placed their orders.

The JC2 MP is not yet released but there are public betas that you can find on <a href="https://www.jc-mp.com/" rel="nofollow">JC2-MP website</a>. So far only purchased <a href="/steam/3015-718/" data-ref-id="3015-718">Steam</a> copies of the game can run this mod and they do not plan to make it on Xbox or PS3 ever. The moderators can change the character models of players but as of yet the player has no choice. The AI/NPC's will not be as present as in the singleplayer. The mod does not effect your singleplayer game in anyway however. You can chat with other players by pressing "T" and all player have unlimited ammo.You can not access the black market tho. During the beta all DLC is disabled.</p><blockquote>Progress Update January 12, 2013, 9:21am<br />The past 2 months have been the most productive days of development the project has ever seen. We brought on another developer, <a href="https://www.jc-mp.com/forums/index.php?action=profile;u=4354" rel="nofollow">Philpax</a>, which sparked a development roar as the two of us pushed feature after feature, and squashed bug after bug.<br />We've been working on some major features and are nearing a feature freeze. What this means is that no more features will be implemented for 0.1, and our focus will turn exclusively to improving stability and squashing bugs.<br />The Lua API has grown extensively since the last test, and you can expect a much more engaging experience thanks to a feature we have decided to keep quiet until the test. We have replaced our rendering engine with the very popular UI framework, CEGUI. This has seen a dramatic improvement to framerates, and enables us to greatly improve the user interface.<br />We will be holding a test in the coming weeks, although it is likely there will be a much smaller test held earlier to members of our IRC channel to test specific areas with a lower player count.<br />Keep your ears and eyes poised on <a href="https://twitter.com/jc2mpdev" rel="nofollow">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jc2mp" rel="nofollow">Facebook</a> as these are the channels we will be announcing the test through.<br /><em>Trix</em></blockquote><h2>PC System Requirements</h2><h3>Minimum</h3><ul><li><b>OS:</b> Microsoft Windows Vista (Windows XP is unsupported)</li><li><b>Processor:</b> Dual-core CPU with SSE3 (Athlon 64 X2 4200 / Pentium D 3GHz)</li><li><b>Memory:</b> 2GB System Memory <b>Hard Drive:</b> 10GB of free drive space</li><li><b>Graphics:</b> DX10 compatible graphics card with 256 MB of memory (Nvidia GeForce 8800 series/ ATI Radeon HD 2600 Pro)</li><li><b>Sound:</b> 100% DirectX 10 compatible sound card</li><li><b>DirectX®:</b> Microsoft DirectX 10</li></ul><h3>Recommended</h3><ul><li><b>OS:</b> Microsoft Windows Vista SP1 or Windows 7</li><li><b>Processor:</b> Intel Core® 2 Duo 2.6 GHz or AMD Phenom X3 2.4GHz or equivalent</li><li><b>Memory:</b> 3GB system Memory</li><li><b>Graphics:</b> DX10 compatible graphics card with 512 MB of memory (Nvidia GeForce GTS 250 series/ ATI Radeon HD 5750 series)</li><li><b>Sound:</b> 100% DirectX 10 compatible Dolby Digital 5.1 sound card</li><li><b>DirectX®:</b> Microsoft DirectX 10.1</li></ul><h2>Demo</h2><p style="">On March 4th, a demo for the game was released on Xbox Live, PSN and PC. The demo placed players in 35 square miles of the desert area in Panau, allowing 30 minutes of gameplay in each playthrough. Players who racked up enough Chaos were allowed to take part in one of the Faction Missions for the Reapers, and eventually unlocked the Black Market, allowing them to upgrade their weapons and call in vehicle drops. A Challenge Mission was also included, in the form of an airborne race in which players flew vehicles through rings against a timer in order to earn money.</p><p style="">The PC version of the demo was found to contain some content from the full game that could be accessed by editing the demo's configuration and .ini files.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>20742</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/1897530-box_jcause2.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/1897530-box_jcause2.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/1897530-box_jcause2.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/1897530-box_jcause2.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/1897530-box_jcause2.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1897530-box_jcause2.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/1897530-box_jcause2.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Just Cause 2]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>51</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-16/]]></api_detail_url><id>16</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: M]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-12/]]></api_detail_url><id>12</id><name><![CDATA[OFLC: MA15+]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-37/]]></api_detail_url><id>37</id><name><![CDATA[PEGI: 18+]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-5/]]></api_detail_url><id>5</id><name><![CDATA[BBFC: 15]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2010-03-23 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-86/]]></api_detail_url><id>86</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360 Games Store]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360-games-store/3045-86/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[XBGS]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-88/]]></api_detail_url><id>88</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation Network (PS3)]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-network-ps3/3045-88/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3N]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/just-cause-2/3030-20742/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[Ultimate Fighting Championship 2009 Undisputed

Despite the early criticism, the game received positive reviews upon release.<br /><br /><h2>Plot</h2> <h3> <b>United States Marines</b></h3>As a private in the <a data-ref-id="3015-2241" href="/united-states-marine-corps/3015-2241/">                                    USMC</a>, you will be fighting against the Japanese soldiers, who seem prepared to accept any losses in order to secure a victory. The Japanese soldiers are armed with weapons typical of their time, such as the <a data-ref-id="3055-2658" href="/type-38-rifle-arisaka/3055-2658/">                                     Arisaka</a> rifle.<br /><br />Initially, the first USMC mission begins with your character trapped in a hut by multiple Japanese soldiers, and a fellow prisoner. This occurs in 1942, and serves as a prologue to the main USMC story, on Makin Atoll. You are mocked by a Japanese officer, who berates you, saying that you are a fool for thinking you are strong for not talking. He blows his cigarette smoke in your face, causing the screen to haze, before going towards your ally. The fellow Marine spits in his face, angering the officer who orders you to both be executed. Your comrade is killed immediately, and before you meet the same fate, <a data-ref-id="3005-9511" href="/sgt-roebuck/3005-9511/">                                     Sergeant Roebuck</a>'s squad intervenes. <br /><br /><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/20011/1375125-shot0317.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1375125" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/20011/1375125-shot0317.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1375125"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/20011/1375125-shot0317.jpg"></a><figcaption> Using a Browning Automatic Rifle</figcaption></figure>You are led out of the hut by Roebuck, where you meet your squadmates. Sullivan is the commanding officer of the operation, and he tells you to pick up a rifle and help to 'tear this place apart'. Initial choices are an <a data-ref-id="3055-439" href="/m1-garand/3055-439/">                                     M1 Garand</a>, or a <a data-ref-id="3055-2661" href="/type-100-submachine-gun/3055-2661/">                                     Type 100</a> SMG. Of course, both can be taken, but you must drop the Nambu pistol. During the advance, your squad encounter groupings of Imperial soldiers. You will also meet the main reason that the Japanese army received a reputation for being utterly brutal: their traps. Your squad is ambushed during the mission, and the USMC squad repay the favor later on by crashing a Japanese fuel truck into a fuel depot. Your main objective is to blow up the ammo cache on the island - really denting the IJN's gear, and potentially flushing them out for other soldiers. Unfortunately, as you are leaving the area, a Japanese soldier swings a sword from a hut window, grievously wounding you. Roebuck shoots the swordsman, and carries you to the boat, where you black out. <br /><br />The next mission for the Marine Corps takes place in 1944, on the island of Peleliu. Your squad is sent out with other groups in order to help take the island. Unfortunately, Peleliu is heavily defended by well embedded Japanese defenders. The boat used is caught on the coral barrier in the ocean, and the team are forced to wade through this while under enemy fire after the boat is hit with artillery. Again, the player's character (Private Miller) cheats death, when Sullivan pulls him from the water before he drowns. You are forced to wade through heavy fire, and reach the island. On the island you call off-shore artillery from the American ships in the water, and help the American Sherman tanks advance along the island. When the tanks reach their destination, the squad take cover in some huts. One of the Japanese survivors bursts into the house and stabs Sullivan to death with the bayonet attached to his rifle (these soldiers are known as banzais, and appear frequently in the USMC campaign). Due to the death of Sullivan, Roebuck becomes the commanding officer. <br /><br />Under Roebuck's command, the group are expected to advance through a swamp in order to take the airfield on Peleliu. Along the path through the swamp, the group find the wreckage of an American <a data-ref-id="3055-2727" href="/p-51-mustang/3055-2727/">                                     P-51 Mustang</a> plane and several living soldiers who had previously found the wreck. One of the soldiers investigates the wreck, and sets off a Japanese trap, which kills the unfortunate Marines who were investigating the wreckage. When the trap goes off the Japanese storm the area, leaving Private Polonsky to question the Japanese, saying "I can't believe they would booby trap our dead...". When the group move towards the airfield they encounter heavier resistance, which is eventually crushed, leaving the Marines free to travel onwards. When the airfield is captured the Japanese make a massive push in order to reclaim it, before the American reinforcements arrive. The Marines manage to hold down the anti-aircraft guns long enough to use them against the infantry, as well as allow the American support to arrive, which wipes out the Japanese tanks before they had a chance to fire any shells that caused major destruction. <br /><br /><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11633-Makin The Docks Scree.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11633" data-size="medium" style="width: 1px" data-ratio="0" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11633-Makin The Docks Scree.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11633"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Night assault on Makin</figcaption></figure>The following mission to this involves playing as a different Marine for a single fight from a <a data-ref-id="3055-1945" href="/pby-catalina/3055-1945/">                                     PBY Catalina</a> gunship. Two Catalinas are attacking merchant ships that are traveling towards <a data-ref-id="3035-37" href="/japan/3035-37/">                                     Japan</a>, and they receive urgent distress signals from <a data-ref-id="3015-5272" href="/united-states-navy/3015-5272/">                                     United States Navy</a> ships, that are being attacked by <a data-ref-id="3015-1189" href="/kamikaze/3015-1189/">                                     kamikaze pilots</a>. The two Catalinas travel to the location of the Navy ships, and do their best to protect them from the large number of kamikaze planes in the area. You are tasked with manning the guns on the Catalina, and to start with all is going well - the kamikazes are being suppressed and destroyed, and the Navy ships are slowly reaching land. However, everything soon goes wrong when the friendly <a data-ref-id="3055-1945" href="/pby-catalina/3055-1945/">                                     PBY Catalina</a> is shot down, and you are left alone to take on the kamikazes - saving yourself as well as the Navy sailors. One of the Zeroes manages to nail the target, and the ship goes down. The Catalina pilot lands the plane on the water, and you must save as many soldiers from their deaths. Upon saving as many soldiers as possible, you are caught in a compromising position. The Japanese are mounting an attack against the Catalina. Just before you are annihilated by the Japanese air force, additional backup arrives in the form of two Navy F4U Corsairs, which gun down the would-be attackers. <br /><br /><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11986/939270-300px_pby_catalina_landing.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-939270" data-size="medium" style="width: 300px" data-ratio="0.78666666666667" data-width="300" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:78.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11986/939270-300px_pby_catalina_landing.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-939270"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11986/939270-300px_pby_catalina_landing.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11986/939270-300px_pby_catalina_landing.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption> Real life PBY Catalina</figcaption></figure>Back with Roebuck's squad, you are tasked with taking Wana Ridge from the Japanese. The Japanese are relentlessly attacking with mortars from Wana Ridge, and they are well entrenched in the area. The Japanese have mortars, and bunkers as well as machine guns. Taking Wana Ridge will be difficult, but not impossible. The attacking Americans are swift in their attack, and eventually you will prevail. Upon pushing the Japanese from Wana Ridge, the <a data-ref-id="3015-2241" href="/united-states-marine-corps/3015-2241/">                   US Marines</a> regroup with the commanding officer of the attack: Major Gordon. The Marines are given some less than positive news: their supplies of ammunition are running ever lower, and they are going to be taking the pinnacle of the Japanese defense next: Shuri Castle. <br /><br />Before the team are sent out to take Shuri Castle, they are able to gather more supplies from a weapon drop. During this, a Japanese sniper nails one of your allies in the head, killing him as he dashes forward for supplies. As soon as this happens, the Imperial Japanese begin to fire <a data-ref-id="3055-899" href="/mortar/3055-899/">                   mortars</a> on the area. They have mortar positions that are located in the castle grounds. Without rushing forward, the Marines will be dead: and if they rush forward they're almost begging for death. Roebuck finds a solution, however: sprinting into the Japanese tunnels. While they are likely going to be well protected, the Marines are armed and willing to fight. Miller is sent forward in the tunnels to check for any Japanese and wipe them out, should they be present. Upon advancing, you will discover that there are Japanese, though they are desperate. They are standing around a table discussing the battle, and they appear to be afraid of the Marines after the recent losses they had made.<br /><br /><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2796/216644-1600x1200.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-216644" data-size="medium" style="width: 960px" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="960" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2796/216644-1600x1200.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-216644"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/2796/216644-1600x1200.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/2796/216644-1600x1200.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption> Japanese soldiers wait to strike. Notice the Banzai with the bayonet mounted to his Arisaka.</figcaption></figure>Upon leaving the tunnels, the marine squad find themselves outnumbered again, before they regroup with other marines. When they regroup, they are able to push forwards into the courtyards of the castle, where the Japanese mortars are located. Naturally, the mortars are protected by Japanese soldiers, as they are the main asset of the castle at this stage. However, the Japanese defense is beginning to falter due to the losses they have sustained, and the ferocity of the Marines. Taking Shuri Castle means going home; ending the war; ending the campaign in the Pacific islands; it means everything to the Marines who are still fighting. After clearing the mortar positions for the Marines you are fighting alongside, Roebuck asks you to man a Japanese mounted machine gun and use it against its owners in order to allow a fellow squad of soldiers to push through as well. When this is completed, the team advance to the main courtyard of Shuri Castle: right outside the main building. On their way to this location however, the team encounter three Japanese soldiers who appear to be surrendering. Private Polonsky and Sergeant Roebuck both advance towards the surrendering Japanese, and prepare to subdue them. However, the 'surrender' is a trap, and the Japanese grab both men.  <br /> <br />You have the opportunity to save one, though there will always be a casualty. Saving Roebuck will reward you with an achievement or trophy, and saving Polonsky will not reward you at all. However, saving Polonsky seems to be a more fitting end due to his actions and dialogue. Saving Roebuck will result in the same scenario, where Polonsky is killed. However, when fighting the final wave of Japanese soldiers, Roebuck will remain completely calm and control his emotions. He will not say much or express his feelings at the loss of Polonsky, despite the fact the two soldiers seemed to have a close relationship in their work. Saving Polonsky will result in Polonsky fighting with you, and frequently speaking. He initially says 'They… they killed the Sergeant!', in shock. However, when fighting he will spout lines such as 'That was for Roebuck you bastard!', and other similar lines.  <br /> <br />Unlike his normal mannerism, he frequently curses at the Japanese during this final moment. When the Japanese have been cleared and everyone is celebrating, Roebuck will say 'It's over… we did it… it's over.' If Polonsky is saved, he will shout something along the lines of 'Fuck yeah! It's over!'. During the mock surrender, you can choose to let both men die by simply walking on. If you do this, nothing changes during the final fight. This final fight also becomes much harder on Veteran difficulty, since Polonsky and Roebuck were invincible AI characters, and you could lie down when injured and let them carry on the fight for a few seconds. It may be better to save Polonsky during the fight on Veteran for he tends to be more aggressive at this point. Note also that there is an achievement for saving Roebuck, so it may be more canonical that Polonsky dies.<br /><br />Upon completing the assault of Shuri Castle you are shown a cutscene of the Enola Gay dropping 'Little Boy', the world's first <a data-ref-id="3055-231" href="/nuclear-bomb/3055-231/">                                     atomic bomb</a>, on Hiroshima. In addition to this footage, speech from President Harry Truman is played in the background.

The Nazis are brutal, and quite possibly more well armed than their Japanese counterparts. This campaign displays the brutality and violence of the Red Army, as well as that of the <a data-ref-id="3015-113" href="/nazis/3015-113/">                   Nazi</a> soldiers who will be fighting against you. Weapons in these missions change, and the fighting tends to take place in much more urban environments instead of the dense jungles of the Pacific Theater.<br /><br />The first mission of the Soviet campaign opens with Dimitri lying in a fountain among the bodies of many Soviet soldiers, who have been brutally massacred. This battle takes place during the legendary Battle of <a data-ref-id="3035-3144" href="/volgograd/3035-3144/">                   Stalingrad</a>, of 1942. <a data-ref-id="3005-2888" href="/josef-stalin/3005-2888/">                                     Josef Stalin</a> sent millions of Russians to fight against the German soldiers, who were trained - unlike the Russians ordered to fight to the death. Dimitri is lying beside the fountain, where he was aware of the ongoings. He sees some of the Russian soldiers crawling away, bleeding to death. Some of the Germans return, wielding <a data-ref-id="3055-265" href="/mp40/3055-265/">                                     MP40</a>s. They open up into the fountain, spraying down anyone trying to survive their massacre. Luckily for Dimitri, he is not shot by the Germans as they believe he is already dead. After the Germans leave the scene of the massacre, one of the survivors puts his finger to his lips, to tell you to remain silent. The survivor is <a data-ref-id="3005-10005" href="/sgt-reznov/3005-10005/">                                     Reznov</a> - a Sergeant in the army. He has been wounded in the battle, and has a badly wounded hand. This wound means that he is unable to snipe - which is not good considering the fact he has a plan to assassinate the General of the <a data-ref-id="3015-113" href="/nazis/3015-113/">                                     Nazi</a> army who orchestrated the massacre you are lying in. However, he feels Dimitri will be capable of aiding him. However, he takes the time to give you a 'crash course' in sniping - through getting you to shoot dead the German soldiers who actually carried out the massacre. He teaches you to pick your shot at the right time and ensure you are not spotted. Once completed, he congratulates you (and if you kill all the enemies using less than five rounds to do so, he will call you a true marksman). <br /><br />After proving your worth to Reznov, he leads you into a coffee shop in order to flank German General Heinrich Amsel's route. When in the coffee shop he assures Petrenko that 'One day… things will be different', and that they will take the fighting 'To their land… to their people… to their blood'. After making these remarks and advancing through, you will make it out into the streets. When in the streets, a shot is taken at you from a German building across the river. The shot narrowly misses Reznov, who takes no time in hurling himself through a window. After following his lead, you will have to engage the German sniper in a shootout, with Reznov's help. The Sergeant takes a massive risk by tempting the sniper into taking a shot through exposing himself, and this will aid you in taking the German down. Upon the death, Reznov beckons you to move quickly, as the Germans will most definitely have heard those shots being fired. During the advance through the house from which you fired, a German patrol spots you and attempts to set the building ablaze. You have to crawl through the house to avoid the flames until you reach the second floor, where you sprint to leap out the window.  <br /><br /><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2796/216675-1600x12002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-216675" data-size="small" style="width: 960px" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="960" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2796/216675-1600x12002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-216675"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/2796/216675-1600x12002.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/2796/216675-1600x12002.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption> Rollin' on through</figcaption></figure>Unfortunately, some burning wood collapses on Dimitri. Reznov rushes back to save the Private. He also waits for you to jump from the house first - an action that he barely survives. The explosion in the house flings him out onto the ground alongside Dimitri Petrenko. While lying on the ground, a German patrol arrives, and prepares to kill both of them. The Germans speak before making an action, and their dialogue is 'Roast these swines'. Before they are able to kill the two of you, a group of Russians open fire on them and aid you in getting up again.<br /><br />The Russian view is that you will be of benefit to them, as they prepare to attack a German communications station. Immediately Reznov spots the advantage from aiding them: Heinrich Amsel will not be able to call for backup when he and Dimitri prepare to end his life. He tells the Russians to wait for Dimitri to fire his rifle, and the screams of dying Germans will signify the start of the attack. When you have aided your comrades in attacking the communications station, Reznov will tell of a vantage point from which Amsel will be an easy target. Amsel has several bodyguards who will try to protect him, though he willhide behind objects, such as the remains of a military transport truck, a <a data-ref-id="3055-2673" href="/flak-88/3055-2673/">                                     Flak 88</a> cannon, and a wall. He will try to make it towards a German Kubelwagen in order to escape, though this can be prevented through killing the driver and then Amsel, blowing up the Kubelwagen, or sniping Amsel down. Once Amsel is dead, the Germans will begin to flood into the house from which you took the shot. The only escape is by leaping through a window into the river below. On the way towards the window, a full stairway of Germans will arrive. Reznov screams out, and mows them down with a <a data-ref-id="3055-1941" href="/ppsh-41/3055-1941/">                                     PPSh-41</a>. <br /><br /><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/20011/1375101-shot0293.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1375101" data-size="medium" style="width: 960px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="960" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/20011/1375101-shot0293.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1375101"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/2/20011/1375101-shot0293.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/2/20011/1375101-shot0293.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption> Taking the Reichstag</figcaption></figure>The next Russian mission cuts to April 18th, 1945, in Seelow Heights. Dimitri is being held captive by three German soldiers. Two Russian soldiers have already been executed, and the Germans are preparing for the inevitable Russian attack. Dimitri spots an <a data-ref-id="3055-2689" href="/tokarev-svt-40/3055-2689/">                                     SVT-40</a> rifle propped against the body of an ally, and as he moves for it one of the Nazis spot him, and reward him with a boot to the face. As they prepare to execute Petrenko in the same manner they did his comrades, a <a data-ref-id="3055-3476" href="/t-34/3055-3476/">                                     T-34</a> tank fires a shell at the house, blowing out a large part of the wall, and hurling two of the Nazis onto the ground. The senior German, and the one responsible for assaulting you, survives the blast of the T-34. However, through the smoke flashes can be seen, and gunshots are heard. The Nazi falls to the ground, dead, as Reznov steps into the house. He greets Dimitri again, and tells another soldier alongside him to execute the two surviving German soldiers. This soldier instead sits down and begins to record the event in a diary. When Reznov screams at him to shoot the men dead, you will discover his name is Chernov. Chernov is one of the major members of your squad, similarly to Polonsky in the Marines. However, Private Chernov is a pacifist, and seems to shy away from combat. He argues that there is no point to shooting the two injured Nazis, as they are already bleeding to death. This may be the case, or he could simply be saying this to avoid having to pull the trigger. Reznov looks to Petrenko and grimly says 'Perhaps our friend here could help them bleed faster…'. <br /><br /><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4432/588141-world_at_war_3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-588141" data-size="medium" style="width: 960px" data-ratio="0.56245090337785" data-width="960" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4432/588141-world_at_war_3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-588141"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/4432/588141-world_at_war_3.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/4432/588141-world_at_war_3.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption> Sgt. Reznov leading the charge</figcaption></figure>When exiting the house, Reznov commands the men under his squad to use their <a data-ref-id="3055-75" href="/molotov-cocktail/3055-75/">                                     Molotov Cocktail</a>'s to burn their wheat fields down. When the fields are being torched, the Nazi soldiers will come running out of the fields, and in some cases will burn to death. The team move across a small river before fighting through some trenches. Reznov remarks to Dimitri that 'They have brought the fight to their land, to their people, and to their blood'. After pushing through the trenches, the team find some houses in what appears to be a farm. However, most farms do not have Tiger tanks operating in them. Therefore, the Tigers will need to be destroyed to ensure the safety of all the Russian troops who are fighting. To do this, it will mean acquiring a German <a data-ref-id="3055-1996" href="/panzerschreck/3055-1996/">                                     Panzerschreck</a>. After this, the Russians fight forwards into a German camp outside of the town. Inside the camp are a large quantity of Nazis, who pose a major threat should they not be dealt with swiftly. Some of the Germans take up positions with rifles in the sniper towers, and are difficult to take down without a longer-ranged weapon, such as a rifle of your own. The mission closes with the squad climbing onto a Russian train, and Reznov making a speech about Dimitri. He says that 'As long as he lives, the heart of this army cannot be broken'. <br /><br />After disembarking from the train in Pankow, the Russians are immediately under fire from the German positions, and the main threat is a mounted MG42 that is laying down lead across the entire area. The ground troops are tasked with moving forward to clear the way for Soviet T-34 tanks to enter the area. One of the T-34s takes aim at a building, which it then blows to pieces. The Russian soldiers are ordered to fight through this building and ensure there are absolutely no survivors. As soon as this is completed, and the Russian soldiers exit the area, they are attacked by well entrenched German troops in an asylum. When this happens, the Red Army decide to move tactically as opposed to using pure brute force. They split their force into two groups. One group will assault the asylum through the front courtyard, and the other group will move along the street and enter the asylum from behind, catching the Germans in a pincer movement. After getting into their position, both groups successfully enter the asylum, and after some intense fighting through it, they eventually wrestle control from the Germans who previously controlled it. When this is done, the Russians regroup with the T-34s that helped them push through Pankow initially. The Germans that previously controlled the asylum flee down the street, and the commanding officer, Commisar Markov announces that 'nobody can resist the will of the Red Army', and that the Nazis should give up all hope. <br /><br /><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11630-Berlin - Street Fight.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11630" data-size="medium" style="width: 1px" data-ratio="0" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11630-Berlin - Street Fight.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11630"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png"></noscript></a><figcaption> Marching through Berlin on a rainy day</figcaption></figure>One of the final missions of the fight takes place in Berlin, on the 24th of April 1945. The Third Reich is nearing collapse, and the Germans are desperate. The Russians are no longer nearing the jewel of the Reich - they are in it. Initially, you are fighting from room to room, and in some of the rooms the Germans are unaware of your presence. When the building is cleansed of fascists, the different Soviet divisions meet up in the street, and charge the defenses with T-34 tanks as support. The Germans are desperate, and are fighting relentlessly. After some difficult fighting, the defenses weaken and the Soviets can move through the city of Berlin. Before entering a metro station in the city, there are a group of German soldiers who are surrendering to the Russians. Reznov feels they deserve nothing better than death for the suffering they caused to the Russian people during 1942, and the Battle for Stalingrad. The 'slow death' involves throwing a Molotov Cocktail and letting the Germans burn to death, whereas the faster death is simply putting a bullet in them. Reznov gives a more favorable comment should you choose the faster death for them. The next part of this mission takes place in the metro that the Germans were surrendering outside of. The Germans have this small area well fortified, and they are prepared to die here. After working through the metro, the Germans unveil their final stand, when they cut the power and flood the station in an attempt to drown the Soviets who are in it. To escape the wave of water, Reznov breaks open a locked door and brings Dimitri and his squad through it. <br /><br />The final fight in the Soviet campaign takes place in the city streets beyond the metro station, and inside the Reichstag itself. To begin with, Reznov congratulates you on cheating death again, and tells you to take a few moments to regain your breath. Chernov is sitting writing in his diary, and this enrages Reznov. He grabs Chernov's diary, and slams it into his chest, shouting 'Nobody will ever read this!' at him. He then grabs the Soviet flag, and thrusts it onto Chernov, roaring "If you lack the stomach to kill for your country, at least show me you are willing to die for it!". Chernov accepts this treatment, and carries the flag without a complaint. Before setting off, Reznov hands Petrenko a PPSh-41 sub-machine gun like his own. The group are briefed by Commissar Markov again, and he tells them to help end this war. <br /><br />Reznov's unit marches towards some housing, outside which there are three Nazi corpses hanging from the tree. Reznov states that 'The Germans hang their cowards from trees', and then orders the team to push forward into the housing the Nazis are controlling. After working through it, the squad will meet other groups preparing to assault the outside of the Reichstag, which is fortified with Flak 88 artillery cannons. Therefore, the Soviets are expected to destroy these in order to enter the Reichstag. Destroying the cannons is no mean feat seeing as the Germans will do anything to ensure the loss of the cannons does not happen. After brutal, slow-paced shooting, the Flak 88s will all be destroyed, and the team can advance. Chernov is unlucky however, and is torched by a flamethrower. Whether this flamethrower kills Chernov or not is unknown, but despite Reznov's mockery of his pacifistic ways, he sprints forward, shooting dead the flamethrower to check Chernov. He takes Chernov's diary, and during the next briefing scene, he reads out an extract from it. Below is the quotation from Chernov's diary:<br /><br /><blockquote> <p style="">The path to Berlin has been swift and brutal… all of it has been necessary. </p></blockquote><br /><br /><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/20011/1375104-shot0296.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1375104" data-size="small" style="width: 960px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="960" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/20011/1375104-shot0296.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1375104"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/2/20011/1375104-shot0296.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/2/20011/1375104-shot0296.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption> This is not CTF</figcaption></figure>     The next battle, and the final battle of World at War, is inside the Reichstag. Reznov says that the men inside this building are the SS Honor Guard, and they will be prepared to die for the Third Reich. The SS are armed with some of the best weapons in the game, such as the <a data-ref-id="3055-1442" href="/stg-44/3055-1442/">                   STG .44</a>, although some of them wield MP40s. Inside the building, the amount of resistance to the Red Army is so great that Reznov takes Dimitri Petrenko alongside him to the balcony, where they may provide support with a <a data-ref-id="3055-2120" href="/ptrs-41/3055-2120/">                   PTRS-41</a> anti-tank rifle. His reasoning for taking Dimitri is that after Stalingrad, he knows Dimitri is a good shot. When the Germans are all dead, and the resistance has pulled back, you are instructed to leave the <a data-ref-id="3055-2120" href="/ptrs-41/3055-2120/">                   PTRS</a> and fight alongside your fellow soldiers. After working through the SS Honor Guard, the final remnants of the shattered Nazi army retreat to the roof, where they are wiped out in their entirety. The flag carrier is shot dead, and Petrenko takes the flag to place, as was done in real life by the Red Army. As Dimitri nears the flag pole, the final Nazi soldier stands up, armed with a <a data-ref-id="3055-2505" href="/walther-p38/3055-2505/">                   Walther P38</a>. He takes a shot, which strikes Dimitri. Reznov screams and lunges at the German with his machete. He butchers the Nazi, and pushes him from the roof of the Reichstag. He then aids Dimitri in placing the Soviet flag, by cutting down the Nazi swastika flag with the same machete. He also holds him, and says to him "You can make it, comrade. You never die. As long as you live, the heart of this army cannot be broken." <br /> <br />The Soviet campaign has gained a reputation for being extremely difficult in World at War due to the sheer number of grenades thrown, though this is a complaint also levelled at the Imperial Japanese missions. Even so, the final two missions in the Soviet campaign are probably the most well known difficult missions of the entire franchise.<br />   <h2><b>Gameplay</b></h2> <figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11634-Pel - HellHathNoFury .jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11634" data-size="medium" style="width: 1px" data-ratio="0" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11634-Pel - HellHathNoFury .jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11634"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>A flamethower in action</figcaption></figure><i>World at War</i> has the most mature theme of the Call of Duty franchise, with more blood and gore than other games. High-powered weapons can tear targets apart, 'gibbing' them (ie. blowing them apart). This increased violence reappeared in <i>Black Ops</i>, though does not carry into the online - however, in <i>World at War, </i>it did. Swimming became a viable choice in-game, with the inclusion of wading through water, albeit at a reduced pace. The M2 Flamethrower, first seen during <i>Call of Duty: United Offensive</i>, returns to the game as well. Treyarch have included flammable environments, in order to maximise the entertainment a heated jet of flame can have. Like previous titles, the game uses a first person perspective, but provides more of an awareness of the character - for example, when a burning log collapses on you, your character will put his hands out in order to protect himself. <i> </i><br /><i> </i><br /> One of the other additions made to World at War is the Bayonet. The Bayonet is an alternative melee weapon to a standard combat knife, and can be fitted to some weapons. Bayonets are similar to a standard knife, but have a longer melee range, and can only be used when holding a weapon equipped for the situation. Smaller weapons, such as the MP40, cannot have a bayonet attached, though larger rifles and machine guns can.  <br /> <br /> Missions are split between a Pacific and European campaign, with a focus on two main characters: Private Miller, and Dimitri Petrenko. Both theatres of war have slightly different play styles. The Japanese fight furiously, frequently rushing and attacking with bayonets, while the Wehrmacht are more cautious with their attacks. Weapons encountered during the campaigns are different, and take some adjustment to use. Missions remove some of the linearity, as there are occasionally multiple paths you may advance along, rather than a single laid-out route.

While in water, the player cannot sprint and will only move at half speed. <a data-ref-id="3055-45" href="/flamethrower/3055-45/">                                     Flamethrowers</a>, first introduced in <i><a data-ref-id="3030-12633" href="/call-of-duty-united-offensive/3030-12633/"> </a></i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> Call of Duty: United Offensive</i>, have been reintroduced with new flammable environments. Another new addition to the game is the use of bayonets. Bayonets are used by pressing the melee attack button, they are similar to standard knife attacks but have a longer range. The game is slightly more open than previous games in the series, as there are sometimes multiple ways to complete missions.  <br />   <h2><b>Multiplayer</b></h2> <p style="">For the first time in the <i>CoD </i>franchise, World at War features cooperative gameplay for up to four players via split-screen (on consoles) or four players online. It also uses a perk system similar to <i>CoD4 </i>and makes use of player-controlled vehicles similar to <i>Call of Duty 3</i>. With support for up to 18 players, the game also features an updated party system, which includes the ability to create private parties. The game has a level cap of 65, as opposed to 55 for <a data-ref-id="3030-2133" href="/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare/3030-2133/"> <i>Call of Duty 4</i></a>, but still has 10 prestige levels. Prestige levels now reward the player, albeit just an extra <i>Create-a-Class</i> slot every few levels.</p> <p style="">The multiplayer itself is very similar to that of <i><a data-ref-id="3030-2133" href="/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare/3030-2133/"> </a></i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> Call Of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</i>. All of the previous game modes are available in <i>World At War</i> except for Cage Match, Old School Team Deathmatch, and Hardcore Headquarters (which may or may not be added in the future). The game allows the player to create custom classes to use during matches, with the option of changing the weapons and attachments as well as perks. The experience system is mostly the same as well. Night vision has been replaced with a map. In addition, players can create squads and use the map to set waypoints for their teammates.</p> <figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15434/755097-codwwbeta_07.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-755097" data-size="medium" style="width: 715px" data-ratio="0.56223776223776" data-width="715" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15434/755097-codwwbeta_07.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-755097"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/15434/755097-codwwbeta_07.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/15434/755097-codwwbeta_07.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Roundhouse</figcaption></figure>Killing an enemy will net you 10 points in some game modes, 5 points in others, and 50 points in Search And Destroy. The assist system returns, but rather than getting 2 points each time, the player can get up to 8 points depending on how much they damaged the enemy. <i>World At War</i> also has game modes that were not in the previous installment: <a data-ref-id="3015-25" href="/capture-the-flag/3015-25/">                                     Capture The Flag</a> and War.

After Christmas 2008, Treyarch released an update for the game that unlocks the Nazi Zombies mode automatically. Up to 4 players must survive as long as possible against a never-ending horde of zombies. With each kill, players earn points which can be used to either buy new weapons and equipment or to unlock different parts of the map. Treyarch also revealed that there is no end to the amount of waves of zombies and that the studios personal best was surviving to wave 23, although many players have managed to make it to the thousands through use of glitches.<br /> <br /><h2>Multiplayer Maps </h2><table class="t-editor full-width with-out-border"><tbody><tr><td><h3> </h3> <h3>Airfield </h3>Airfield is a large map that takes place in an  airfield.

The map features a large castle on one side as well  as another large building on the other side. There are many courtyards,  alternate routes, and flanking opportunities on the map.  Castle is based on the idea of Shuri Castle, and concepts from the single player mission at the castle can be seen in the map. This is not the same castle, though the courtyard is identical due to the reusage of resources from the single player in the online experience. Castle is also known for a glitch allowing you to walk through a wall and leave the map. Treyarch countered this by having those outside the map take damage from an invisible enemy, which players christened a shark. This is the only glitch in the entire game where Treyarch chose to leave it accessible upon discovery, but with a surprise. It has since been patched so it cannot be glitched out of.<br /><br /></td><td><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14440/1444840-castle.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1444840" data-size="medium" style="width: 960px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="960" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14440/1444840-castle.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1444840"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/14440/1444840-castle.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/14440/1444840-castle.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Castle</figcaption></figure></td></tr><tr><td><h3> </h3> <h3>Cliffside </h3>Cliffside is a medium-large sized map that takes  place on the edge of a cliff.

Another building is situated on the other side of the center that seems  to be a former library and contains large windows that can leave players  very vulnerable or in perfect sniping position if they are good enough.  The other half of the map contains a large building as well with a  similar courtyard for defending. Deep into this half can be found some  great sniping positions as well.

There are many buildings including two main ones situated  near the entrances of the hangar.  The hangar features a walkway with approaches for both factions, and so can be used to get an ambush on enemies on the ground, but at the risk of being flanked.

This is not a major benefit to the Wehrmacht team, as the map is more than bright enough to see your enemies, but stealthy players may favor hiding in the shadows when they are on the Wehrmacht side.

This mode grew  extremely popular, which is surprising due to the fact it initially  started as an in-joke with the employees of Treyarch. The mode is  unlocked upon completion of the game's campaign, though if the console  used to play the game accesses the internet and downloads an update,  Treyarch made Nazi Zombies mode accessible regardless of campaign  progress. Initially, Zombies contains one map: Nacht der Untoten (German  for 'Night of the Dead'). However, with each of the three map packs  released, an additional Zombies map was included. Technically, upon the  release of Map Pack 2, it is no longer correct to call the mode 'Nazi  Zombies', due to the fact that the Zombie level, Shi No Numa, is  Japanese, and features Imperial Japanese zombies. Nazi Zombies can be played with up  to four players, both online and offline. Through injuring or killing  Zombies, player earn points. Initially they start off in a small area,  with some chalk outlines of weapons on the wall. They may purchase  these weapons for a set amount of points, or pay to open a door. Opening  doors allows access to different areas, but Zombies can also attack  through these areas. Later maps also included different machines, such  as vending machines, and with Verrückt, the ability to pay in order to  restore power to the facility. Upon killing all the zombies in a wave,  another wave will begin. The mode has an infinite number of waves, and  zombies grow stronger from round to round. It is impossible to reach an  'end' in Zombies due to the fact there is none. <br /><br /><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/20011/1375132-shot0324.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1375132" data-size="medium" style="width: 960px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="960" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/20011/1375132-shot0324.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1375132"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/2/20011/1375132-shot0324.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/2/20011/1375132-shot0324.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption> Pop</figcaption></figure>     This mode  has become a modern phenomena among players, with some prolific members  of the Call of Duty community reporting easter eggs, which unveil more  to the story. One of these sites is Call of Duty Zombies, or CoDz as it  is also known. The site can be accessed here, and is a forum devoted  mainly to the discussion of the Zombies mode. Across the three map packs  for World at War, the Zombie maps increased in scope, and advanced a  storyline that was told through easter eggs only. Map Pack 2 contained a  modified version of the multiplayer map 'Asylum', entitled Verrückt,  which is German for 'crazy'. This map was the first to contain the Perk  vending machines, which gave players different perks from online  gameplay in Zombies mode, which potentially could make the survival  easier during tough moments. Map Pack 2 contained a map entitled Shi No  Numa, which is a Japanese-based map, and roughly translates to 'Zombie  Swamp'. This map introduced the characters of the 'storyline'.  Furthermore, the Zombie Swamp technically stops the mode from accurately  being classed as Nazi Zombies, due to the fact that the Japanese  soldiers during World War II were not Nazis. Shi No Numa also introduced  the 'Hellhounds' - large dogs that are ablaze, and can rip you to  shreds in seconds due to their speed and strength. Hounds come in packs,  and music will begin to play when they arrive in a round. During a  Hellhound round, no Zombies will spawn. Furthermore, Shi No Numa  introduced the 'Wonder Weapon' - the Wunderwaffe DG-2. The weapon is a  fictional German creation, that fires bolts of electricity and can fry  more than one zombie in a single shot. The final map pack to be released  was Map Pack 3, which contained the Zombie factory (Der Riese). Der  Riese is an extremely large map, and it contains such features as the  'Pack-a-Punch Machine'. This machine allows you to take a regular  weapon, and then upgrade it vastly. The upgraded weapon is altered  visually, and performs better than the standard weapons.<br />     <h3>Perks <br /></h3>In  Verruckt (Map Pack 2) perks are introduced into the action for a fee  players could become more powerful along with their weapons.    <p style=""><a href="/"> </a><a data-ref-id="3055-3594" href="/juggernog/3055-3594/">                   Juggernog</a> - 2500pts, increases your health <br /><a href="/"> </a><a data-ref-id="3055-3605" href="/quick-revive/3055-3605/">                   Quick Revive</a> - 1500pts, shortens the time it takes to revive a fallen team member <br /><a data-ref-id="3055-3596" href="/double-tap-root-beer/3055-3596/">                                    Double Tap Root Beer</a> - 2000pts, doubles your rate of fire<br /><a href="/"> </a><a data-ref-id="3055-3595" href="/speed-cola/3055-3595/">                   Speed Cola</a> - 3000pts, decreases reload time </p> <h3>Mystery Box<br /></h3><a href="/"> </a><a data-ref-id="3055-3608" href="/the-mystery-box/3055-3608/">                   The Mystery Box</a>  is a random weapon generator.

Roebuck firing his Thompson</figcaption></figure>The Nintendo Wii version of <i>World at War</i> has a number of features either missing or changed compared to the other console versions despite the publisher's previous claims of it being an identical gameplay experience. Most notably, Nazi Zombie mode and the vehicles from the multi-player modes have been removed, as have the death cards. The game also lacks compatibility with the Wii Speak accessory.  Most of the maps, weapons, leveling, and the perk systems are in the game, though any perks and challenges relating to vehicles have been removed.  Additionally, the knife challenge isn't available in the Wii version. Cooperative mode (called "Squad Mode") is different in the WIi version; one player controls as they normally would in single player mode, but, strangely, another player can aim and shoot on the same screen.<br /><br />Reviewers generally agree that the Wii controls work well, though a common sentiment is that they're still not as well handled as <i><a data-ref-id="3030-9967" href="/medal-of-honor-heroes-2/3030-9967/"> </a></i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i>Medal of Honor Heroes 2</i>'s control system. The game's visuals have also been praised for their quality despite the inherent limitations imposed by the Wii's hardware and despite not being the lead platform for development.  Judging by the numerical scores on aggregate review sites Metacritic and GameRankings, <i>Call of Duty: World at War </i>is among the best first person shooter experiences available on the Wii, second only to <i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i><a data-ref-id="3030-4725" href="/metroid-prime-3-corruption/3030-4725/"> </a></i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> <a data-ref-id="3030-4725" href="/metroid-prime-3-corruption/3030-4725/"> </a></i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i>Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</i>.  <br /> <br /><h2>Limited Collector's Edition</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/32849/1535922-waw_le.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1535922" data-size="medium" style="width: 335px" data-ratio="0.92238805970149" data-width="335" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:92.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/32849/1535922-waw_le.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1535922"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/3/32849/1535922-waw_le.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/3/32849/1535922-waw_le.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption> Limited Collector's Edition</figcaption></figure>     Limited Edition copies of Call of Duty: World at War were available at release of the game, in 2008. The Limited Edition copies of the game come in a large steel case, with the Call of Duty: World at War logo emblazoned upon it. The Limited Edition also includes a plastic 'hip-flask' ornament, styled like those which appeared in <a data-ref-id="3015-471" href="/world-war-ii/3015-471/">                   World War II</a>. The Limited Edition contained a code for the M1 Carbine and FG42 weapons to be unlocked immediately, at Rank 1. In actuality, it did not unlock the weapons as such - it replaced the weapons in two Default classes. The game also came with a code to enter the 'Officer's Club', which afforded seven days of Double XP and a gold clan tag to members. The Double XP ran for a week after redemption of the code, but the Gold clan tag was a permanent bonus.<br /> <br /><h2>Reception</h2>Reception for Call of Duty: World at War was generally quite impressive, and it was well received among gaming critics, who praised the campaign and multiplayer, even if it was somewhat familiar. Giant Bomb shared this view, saying that while the game was good, it was 'trapped in the shadow of a better game'.   <br /> <br /><h3>Metacritic  </h3><h3>Professional Reviews </h3>The Xbox 360 version of the game has an aggregated Metascore of 84, which is relatively high. Destructoid were responsible for effectively damning the game to readers, giving a 60/100 rating. Their attributed quote reads: <br /><br /><blockquote><p style="">Ultimately, the single player campaign is atrocious and I had a rotten time playing it. It seems to take everything that was frustrating about Modern Warfare, magnify those elements, and then leave out the interesting objectives, characters that matter, and anything that leaves a lasting impression beyond anger and disappointment.     </p></blockquote>The review was written by Jim Sterling, who has a relatively negative opinion in the gaming world. Responses to Sterling's review have been mixed, and generally the review was not noted as much as larger gaming press. Both AceGamez and Yahoo! Games have given the game full 100/100 ratings, which is extremely impressive.  <br /> <br /><b>AceGamez'</b> quote reads: <br /><blockquote><p style="">Its fairly brief but dramatic and adrenaline-fuelled campaign has been greatly enhanced by the excellent co-op mode and XP incentives, while its multiplayer is every bit as good as CoD 4, making this arguably the definitive Call of Duty experience thus far.     </p></blockquote> <br />Meanwhile, <b>Yahoo! Games</b> quote reads: <br /><blockquote><p style="">Call of Duty: World at War is clearly one of the top games of this year, and a must have for any action gamer.    <br /></p></blockquote> <br

Eight-round magazines for the M1911 pistol were not available during WWII, becoming available around the 1980s.

Developed by EA Tiburon with a less orthodox approach to the sport, NFL Tour strived to create a more accessible football experience.  ]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<p style=""> <br/></p><h2>Gameplay<br/></h2> NFL Tour features a more accessible take on the standard Madden game. While on offense, there is a myriad of special moves you can perform to aid you in dealing with defenders. Each face button represents an action your character can take to avoid being tackled, including a dive, a power tackle, a juke (Or wall run, if near one), and a lateral pass. Directly after tackles, there is occasionally a final opportunity to avoid the tackle, or to finish it, performed with a timed button press. <br/><h2>Game Modes<br/></h2> NFL Tour features a myriad of game modes, including standard exhibition and online play. The Tour mode features matches in locations around the United States that must be won meeting certain conditions. For example, while in San Francisco, only passing plays are allowed and first downs are 20 yards, instead of the standard 10.  <br/> <br/>The Redzone Rush mode features 1 on 1 play, switching off between attempting to score touchdowns and attempting to stop your opponent. Smash and Dash is another 1 on 1 extra-curricular mode that is reminiscent of arena combat. One player starts with the ball while trying to evade the other, your score is based on the amount of time you are in possession of the ball as well as bonus spotlights players run through to achieve additional points.<br/> <br/><h2>Reception<br/></h2> NFL Tour was panned by the majority of critics, with a mere 49/100 score average on Metacritic. Many reviewers were unhappy with the campy attitude that the FMV and commentary attempted to achieve. The majority also claimed that the game simply did not have enough value to be worth the price at release.<br/><br/><h2>The Soundtrack</h2><ul class="plain-list"><li>Aceyalone featuring Chali 2Na - "Easy, Lightning Strikes"</li><li>Airbourne - "Blackjack, Runnin' Wild"<br/></li><li>All Time Low - "This Is How We Do, So Wrong, It's Right"<br/></li><li>Biffy Clyro - "Saturday Superhouse Puzzle"<br/></li><li>Black Tide - "Shout Light From Above"<br/></li><li>E Da Boss featuring Gift Of Gab &amp; Lateef The Truth Speaker - "Go Left Go Left"<br/></li><li>Flo Rida - "Radio, Mail On Sunday"<br/></li><li>L.A.

The Y button (on Xbox 360) or the Triangle button (on PS3) can be used to launch the ball into the air. If you are standing still, the player will start to juggle, but if you are running, he'll knock the ball in front of him to set himself up for a volley or beat a player. You can also use the stick to do ground tricks, both in beating players or using various flashy-looking drags. Finally, you can trap the ball with the left trigger or L2 for additional tricks. A player can also do some extremely unrealistic tricks such as running along a wall with the ball at his feet, then flipping off it and beating a player before knocking the ball over another defender and ramming the ball into the net (or any other object that serves as a goal). Situations such as these are very common in the FIFA Street games.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><ul><li>Hexstatic - Red Laser Beam</li><li>Hexstatic - Tokyo Traffic</li><li>Hexstatic - Bust</li><li>Tim Deluxe - Let The Beats Roll</li><li>Tim Deluxe - Let The Beats Roll (Rennie Pilgrim Mix)</li><li>Asian Dub Foundation - Stop Start</li><li>Bassnectar (feat.

In the game, the player takes control of either Wall-E or EVE (and sometimes, both at the same time) as they adventure through 9 levels that follow the same plot as the movie and allow the player to play scenes taken directly from the film. The Wall-E gameplay consists of platforming segments that use his ability to crush cubes and throw them, while the EVE gameplay segments play out similarly to a flying game. Additionally, the Wii version of the game included multiple mini-games, including two on-rail light gun levels , and a cooperative mode.  The PS2 and PC version was developed seperately from the Wii/XBox 360/PS3 version and features 26 chapters, shorter EVE flight sequences, and increased gameplay diversity. <br /> <br /><h2>Arabic Version</h2>THQ partnered up with Emirati company Pluto Games to release a localized version of the game in the Middle East, marking Wall-E as the first Western game to be officially translated and produced into Arabic for seventh generation video game consoles. THQ's Export Sales &amp; Marketing Manager, Luke Keighran said in a press release that "there are only few games that would suit the Middle East's morals more than <em>WALL-E</em>. The game depicts family virtues through a fun and adventurous story line", following up that  THQ "do hope it will be the first of a long line up for Arabic titles in the future". However, the Arabic translated version is only available on the PS3, PSP and 360, despite the original version of the game also being available for the PS2, DS, Wii and PC.<br /> <h2>Xbox 360 Installation<br /></h2>The amount of memory it takes to install this game is 4.7 GB.]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>20794</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/2284725-box_walle.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/2284725-box_walle.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/2284725-box_walle.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/2284725-box_walle.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/2284725-box_walle.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2284725-box_walle.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/2284725-box_walle.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Wall-E]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>3</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-6/]]></api_detail_url><id>6</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB:

<a href="/third-person-perspective/3015-464/" data-ref-id="3015-464">third-person</a> science-fiction <a href="/survival-horror/3015-4801/" data-ref-id="3015-4801">survival horror</a> game that was created at <a href="/electronic-arts/3010-1/" data-ref-id="3010-1">EA</a>'s <a href="/ea-redwood-shores/3010-121/" data-ref-id="3010-121">Redwood Shores</a> studio. The story takes place on the <a href="/usg-ishimura/3035-1678/" data-ref-id="3035-1678">USG Ishimura</a>, an enormous Planet-Cracker-class ship, and <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/aegis-vii/3035-1819/" data-ref-id="3035-1819">Aegis VII</a>, the planet being cracked. The player controls <a href="/isaac-clarke/3005-1197/" data-ref-id="3005-1197">Isaac Clarke</a>, an engineer attached to a small maintenance crew responding to a distress signal from the Ishimura. However, neither Isaac nor his team have any idea what is waiting for them aboard the ship. Creatures known as <a href="/necromorph/3015-2472/" data-ref-id="3015-2472">Necromorphs</a> have taken over the ship and infected the entire crew. It is up to Isaac and his companions to get a grasp of what has happened aboard the ship and, more importantly, survive.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">Dead Space is a third person action game that mixes those conventions with survival horror.</p><p style="">Isaac isn't a soldier, so he isn't always equipped with proper weaponry. He mostly uses repurposed engineering tools. The Necromorphs on the Ishimura are both stronger and faster than Isaac so he must use his wits to take them out. Unlike other shooter games, if the player runs out of ammo there is no fallback weapon. This means that players will have to use Isaac's heavy duty mining boots and melee attack to stomp and smash his enemies, respectively. This encourages the player to conserve ammo and attack the Necromorphs' limbs to reduce their combat effectiveness. EA has named this <i>strategic dismemberment</i>.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/921933-dedspgenscrn052808v5_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-921933" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/921933-dedspgenscrn052808v5_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-921933"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/921933-dedspgenscrn052808v5_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg"></a><figcaption>Strategic dismemberment at work.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Isaac's main weapon, the plasma cutter, presents the player with multiple options for eliminating his foes, depending on the situation. For example, cutting off an alien's head will cause it to thrash blindly and become an easy target, while going for its appendages might slow it down enough for the player to safely get by without using too much precious ammo. Early alien encounters are relatively easy to begin with but become increasingly more complex as the player progresses through the game. Players will eventually encounter more advanced forms of Necromorphs, including pregnant Necromorphs which have a tendency to spew out hundreds of flesh-eating parasites, and discover that indiscriminate shooting is not such a wise idea.</p><p style="">Isaac comes across stores in many areas that allow him to purchase ammo, med packs, air canisters, and more. Additionally, he can sell items for Credits and even store items in a universal safe. Throughout the game, he also comes across Power Nodes that allow him to upgrade his weapons and suit at Benches.</p><h2>Story</h2><h3>Main Characters</h3><h4>Isaac Clarke</h4><figure data-ref-id="1300-1212560" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/34651/1212560-0isaac2.jpg" data-size="small" data-align="right" data-ratio="1" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/34651/1212560-0isaac2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1212560"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/34651/1212560-0isaac2.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/34651/1212560-0isaac2.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Isaac Clarke, the game's protagonist.</figcaption></figure><p style=""><a href="/isaac-clarke/3005-1197/" data-ref-id="3005-1197">Isaac Clarke</a> is the <a href="/silent-protagonist/3015-54/" data-ref-id="3015-54">silent protagonist</a> of the game.

The company uses large ships called Planet Crackers<i>,</i> which are used to literally tear planets open by extracting large sections of the crust, or corks, and mine the valuable resources that they contain. The first Planet Cracker-class ship is the <a href="/usg-ishimura/3035-1678/" data-ref-id="3035-1678">USG Ishimura</a>, the largest planet cracker in service. Right before the events of Dead Space the Ishimura was cracking <a href="/aegis-7/3035-1819/" data-ref-id="3035-1819">Aegis VII</a>. Isaac has a girlfriend, <a href="/nicole-brennan/3005-8976/" data-ref-id="3005-8976">Nicole Brennan</a>, who is a Senior Medical Officer aboard the Ishimura. The story of Dead Space doesn't dwell on their relationship, but it is revealed that Isaac and Nicole care deeply about each other. When the Ishimura transmits a distress signal, a crew of five is sent on the small USG Kellion to fix the problem. Isaac volunteers, along with <a href="/zach-hammond/3005-8949/" data-ref-id="3005-8949">Zach Hammond</a>, <a href="/kendra-daniels/3005-8948/" data-ref-id="3005-8948">Kendra Daniels</a>, and two other unnamed members, to go to the Ishimura. Another key element to the plot of Dead Space is <a href="/unitology/3015-2416/" data-ref-id="3015-2416">Unitology</a>. Unitology is a religion whose members believe an ancient, possibly alien artifact called the <a href="/the-marker/3055-2540/" data-ref-id="3055-2540">Marker</a> is the key to an eternal afterlife. Many of the USG Ishimura's crew members are Unitoligists. It is possible that the Marker has more influence on the USG Ishimura's mining mission than expected.</p><p style=""><a href="/isaac-clarke/3005-1197/" data-ref-id="3005-1197">Isaac Clarke</a>, <a href="/kendra-daniels/3005-8948/" data-ref-id="3005-8948">Kendra Daniels</a>, <a href="/zach-hammond/3005-8949/" data-ref-id="3005-8949">Zach Hammond</a>, and two unnamed men are on-board the USG Kellion and are heading to the USG Ishimura to respond to its distress signal. Isaac is viewing a video log from his girlfriend <a href="/nicole-brennan/3005-8976/" data-ref-id="3005-8976">Nicole</a>. As the <a href="/usg-kellion/3035-2805/" data-ref-id="3035-2805">Kellion</a> is about to dock into the Ishimura, a malfunctioning magnetic field causes it to crash land. Everyone survives and the crew enter the Ishimura. When Isaac checks the status of the ship, creatures known as <a href="/necromorph/3015-2472/" data-ref-id="3015-2472">Necromorphs</a> emerge from the air ducts and kill the two unnamed crew members. Isaac escapes but is briefly separated from Kendra and Hammond; they reconvene at a tram station a short while later. Isaac repairs the ship's tram system so Hammond and Kendra can go to the bridge to get more information and Hammond orders Issac back to the Kellion to prepare for takeoff. As soon as Isaac reaches the Kellion's controls, Necromorphs attack and the Kellion explodes, trapping the three on-board the Ishimura.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2403/787190-usg_ishimura.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-787190" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.56230031948882" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2403/787190-usg_ishimura.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-787190"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2403/787190-usg_ishimura.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2403/787190-usg_ishimura.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Concept art for the USG Ishimura.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Isaac begins to do tasks for Hammond and Kendra to improve the condition of the ship. First, he goes to the Medical Deck to get the deceased captain's <a href="/rig/3055-1791/" data-ref-id="3055-1791">R.I.G.</a> From this the three learn the condition of the ship; overrun by Necromorphs, almost all of the crew were killed and turned into more Necromorphs. The Necromorphs are revealed by Kendra to be an alien lifeform capable of reanimating corpses.</p><p style="">Later, while the Ishimura is being bombarded by meteors, Hammond seals and releases a Necromorph in an escape pod. At this point, Isaac starts seeing cryptic messages of Nicole saying <i>"make us whole again."</i> Issac mans a turret to protect the ship from meteors while Hammond repairs the ship's asteroid defense system. Afterward it is revealed that something is poisoning the air, and the ship will shortly run out of oxygen. Meanwhile, Kendra grows suspicious of Hammond and his knowledge of what has happened on the ship.</p><p style="">Isaac returns to the Medical Deck to concoct a poison to destroy the oxygen blocker. Here he encounters the first significant survivor -- <a href="/dr-challus-mercer/3005-8977/" data-ref-id="3005-8977">Dr. Challus Mercer</a>. Mercer is a crazed Unitologist who believes that the Necromorphs are the successors to the human race and that the reanimation process is the only way to achieve eternal life. Mercer attempts to stop Clarke's actions by releasing an unkillable Necromorph on him.</p><p style="">Barely escaping, Isaac goes to the Hydroponics Deck to restore oxygen. Here Isaac sees Hammond barely able to breathe. Once Isaac defeats the giant slug Necromorph that was preventing oxygen production, Hammond disappears. Kendra (who keeps seeing her dead brother in hallucinations) sends Isaac to the Mining Deck to send out an S.O.S. beacon.</p><p style="">Here Isaac encounters Nicole who is apparently alive and well. The beacon gets received by the military ship, the <i><a href="/usm-valor/3035-2806/" data-ref-id="3035-2806">USM Valor</a></i>. Unfortunately, the Valor also received the escape pod that Hammond sealed. Apparently the single Necromorph in the pod was enough to cause the Valor to lose control and come crashing into the hull of the USG Ishimura. Immediately after the crash Hammond contacts Issac; someone was jamming his R.I.G.'s communication, but it stopped after the crash. In addition, Isaac also learns that the USM Valor was actually sent to destroy the Ishimura.</p><p style="">Isaac is sent aboard the Valor to get a part for an intact but unusable shuttle on the Ishimura. Another survivor from the Ishimura, <a href="/dr-terrence-kyne/3005-8980/" data-ref-id="3005-8980">Dr. Terrance Kyne</a>, contacts Isaac. Kyne is a Unitologist who accidentally killed the captain. Kyne tells Isaac that an artifact called the Marker is on-board the Ishimura and is responsible for the Necromorph infection. He urges Clarke to return the Marker to the Aegis VII colony in a shuttle. Before leaving the Valor, Hammond is ripped to pieces by a Brute (mini-boss Necromorph) and dies. Kendra, while in doubt of Hammond earlier, is still greatly affected by this. She tells Isaac to follow Kyne's instructions but to be careful.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/921931-dedspgenscrn052808v3_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-921931" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/921931-dedspgenscrn052808v3_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-921931"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/921931-dedspgenscrn052808v3_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/921931-dedspgenscrn052808v3_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Isaac battles a Necromorph.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Kyne meets up with Isaac and tells him that the Marker was unearthed by the colonists on Aegis VII, and that a gigantic creature that controls the Necromorphs called the <a href="/the-hive-mind/3005-9106/" data-ref-id="3005-9106">Hive Mind</a> was also found. In this chapter Isaac also can discover that the current mining operation is illegal and most likely financed by the Church of Unitology. Also, Clarke defeats the unkillable Necromorph from earlier, which prompts Dr. Mercer to allow himself to be killed by a Necromorph, an act he believes is the first step to achieving the second life that the Church of Unitology looks forward to. Isaac then retrieves the Marker and brings it to the shuttle for its return to Aegis VII.</p><p style="">As Clarke is about to leave with Kyne and the Marker on the shuttle, Kendra kills Kyne. She reveals that she is really a government agent sent to retrieve the Marker. She also reveals that the Marker that was found on Aegis VII is really an experiment and man-made. According to her, the Marker was based off of another Marker found on Earth centuries earlier. The new Marker was a disaster and was buried, only to be unearthed by the Ishimura. Kendra then takes the shuttle and abandons Isaac on the Ishimura. Nicole makes another appearance to help return the shuttle. However, Kendra uses an escape pod on the shuttle to land on the colony below.</p><p style="">Isaac takes the shuttle to Aegis VII to return the Marker to its rightful place. When Isaac puts the Marker back on it's pedestal, Kendra encounters him once again. This time she reveals that Nicole has been dead all along and Isaac was just receiving hallucinations from the Hive Mind. In addition, the large chunk of planet being held above Aegis VII by gravity tethers begins falling. Kendra proceeds to take the Marker back to the shuttle. As she is about to leave, the Hive Mind emerges and crushes/smears Kendra. Isaac is able to kill the Hive Mind and quickly flees on the shuttle as the giant piece of planet destroys the colony. On the shuttle, Isaac removes his helmet and views Nicole's message one last time; this time, however, he cuts it short willingly. As he turns his head, a terrifying vision of Nicole attacks him. The credits roll.</p><h3>Logs</h3><p style="">Throughout the game, Isaac will come across video, text, and audio logs that fill in the story of the USG Ishimura before and during the Necromorph infestation. There is a series of audio logs from an engineer on the ship named <a href="/jacob-temple/3005-12441/" data-ref-id="3005-12441">Jacob Temple</a> that are found in chronological order. In them, Temple documents his attempts to repair several parts of the ship during the Necromorph infestation. It is worth mentioning that Temple is not only similar to Isaac in that he visited the same parts of the ship, but he is also extremely resilient; he managed to traverse many sections of the ships without dying or being driven insane by the dementia that was spreading throughout the ship.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><p style="">There are <b>seven</b> weapons in Dead Space. Each weapon's damage, ammo capacity, speed, and reload can be upgraded. Also, every weapon has an alternate fire mode. The weapons are:</p><ul><li><h3><b><a href="/plasma-cutter/3055-1743/" data-ref-id="3055-1743">211-V Plasma Cutter</a></b></h3></li></ul><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1670682-dead_space_plasma_cutter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1670682" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.55555555555556" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:55.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1670682-dead_space_plasma_cutter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1670682"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1670682-dead_space_plasma_cutter.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1670682-dead_space_plasma_cutter.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Plasma Cutter</figcaption></figure><p style="">Initially a tool used for the cutting of rock and other objects, the Plasma Cutter is essentially Dead Space's pistol. It holds 10 shots to begin with, but can be upgraded to hold 20 shots. It shoots on a vertical plane but its alternate fire mode flips the gun so that it shoots on a horizontal plane, which is useful for dealing with wider enemies or cutting legs. After fully upgrading the Plasma Cutter's damage, it becomes one of the most powerful and versatile weapons in the game, as a fully upgraded Plasma Cutter can cut through almost any enemy limb with one shot, ammo is fairly abundant, and the ability to switch the firing plane allows for easier dismemberment. Moreover, the range of the Plasma Cutter is as good as the Contact Beam. Getting 30 kills with this weapon will unlock the 'Tool Time' achievement/trophy. Additionally, using only this weapon on a single playthrough will unlock the 'One Gun' achievement/trophy.</p><p style="">Statistics: Initial Cost: 0 Shots Per Sec: 1 Damage: 10 Ammo Capacity: 10 Ammo Cost: 1200 (6 shot)</p><ul><li><h3><a href="/pulse-rifle/3055-1794/" data-ref-id="3055-1794"><b>SWS Motorized</b> <b>Pulse Rifle</b></a></h3></li></ul><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1670684-pulse_rifle.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1670684" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:50.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1670684-pulse_rifle.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1670684"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1670684-pulse_rifle.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1670684-pulse_rifle.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Pulse Rifle</figcaption></figure><p style="">The standard assault rifle used by marines and security personnel. Unlike most of the other game's weaponry, the Pulse Rifle is an actual weapon, and not a tool that Isaac uses as a weapon. The gun works on essentially the same principle as a rail gun. It uses magnetic induction coils to shoot a round at high speed. It initially holds 50 shots, but can be upgraded to hold 200. Its secondary fire is a 360 degree bullet explosion, useful when you're surrounded. Focused fire on limbs can severe them, but at the cost of more time.

It is great for torching the Necromorphs, and works well in close-quarters. Since the Necromorphs' limbs are so fragile, the flamethrower even has the ability to dismember foes. It's secondary fire is a straight flame projectile with limited range. The projectile consumes 10 rounds of ammo when fired. Additionally, both firing modes can set a target on fire, which causes it to burn for a few seconds dealing damage over time. The major downsides to the flamethrower are its high rate of ammo consumption, scarcity of ammo pick-ups, and the inability to use it in vacuum environments due to the lack of oxygen. Getting 30 kills with this weapon will unlock the 'Live with the Hot Ones' achievement/trophy.</p><p style="">Statistics : Initial Cost: 11000 Shots Per Sec: N/A Damage: 0.75 Ammo Capacity: 125 Ammo Cost: 1000 (25 unit)</p><ul><li><h3><a href="/ripper/3055-1795/" data-ref-id="3055-1795"><b>RC-DC Remote Control Disc</b> <b>Ripper</b></a></h3></li></ul><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1670686-ripper.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1670686" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.952" data-width="250" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 250px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:95.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1670686-ripper.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1670686"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1670686-ripper.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1670686-ripper.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Ripper</figcaption></figure><p style="">Another tool that Isaac turns into a weapon, the Ripper is essentially the game's chainsaw. It initially carries 8 blades, that when fired, leash onto the gun and can be used to plow through foes. The secondary fire of the Ripper shoots a saw-blade powerfully straight ahead. The game also seems to favor ammo drops for this weapon. So having it in your inventory with the Plasma Cutter will ensure that at least two of your four weapon slots will be sufficiently stocked with ammo for large scale enemy encounters. The Ripper is also very thrifty in terms of its ammo consumption as both the primary and secondary fire modes both consume one round of ammo. Moreover, you can also use Kinesis to grab a saw blade after the tether disappears after firing the weapon in primary mode. You can then shoot the saw blade using Kinesis to get even more use out of that one round.

It also has a wider range than the Plasma Cutter and is much more powerful. The ammunition has explosive capabilities, and the gun holds five "line racks" when first acquired. It's secondary fire launches a single ball of mines in a straight line, which has a delayed fuse. The Line Gun's secondary fire is capable of blowing Necromorphs to pieces and at its max level can even kill Isaac if used in a confined space. Moreover, the primary fire is capable of killing enemies without even dismembering them when shot at the enemies center of mass. The blast from the primary fire is also capable of cleaving through multiple targets with one shot, so try to group the enemies appropriately when using it.

Likely used by the miners for breaking into rock, the gun can be described as having "shotgun-like" qualities. It is extremely powerful, but only at close range. At longer distances, the gun's primary fire does little to no damage at all. The secondary fire of the weapon compensates for this by turning the Force Gun into a makeshift grenade launcher. The force bomb that it launches is capable of detonating on impact with an enemy. If the bomb fails to hit it will roll around on the ground for a short period of time before detonating. At its maximum damage level the primary fire is capable of shearing off the limbs of a Necromorph at close range and the secondary fire can blow an enemy to pieces on impact. The gun holds 8 shots when it is first acquired.

The Contact Beam is analogous to a sniper rifle. The primary fire has a short charge duration, but when fired unleashes a hellish beam that destroys most enemies in one blast that can traverse the length of a room or corridor with ease. The ammo for this weapon is very expensive. Moreover, the initial ammo capacity is only 4 rounds. Its secondary fire works sort of like a jackhammer, and it creates a powerful blast of energy that shoots through the ground, damaging all nearby enemies. It is likely that when fully upgraded, the Contact Beam is the most powerful weapon in the game.

These modules help greatly in traversing the ship and defeating enemies.</p><h3>Stasis</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11986/1762179-stasis_meter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1762179" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.56285714285714" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11986/1762179-stasis_meter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1762179"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11986/1762179-stasis_meter.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11986/1762179-stasis_meter.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Stasis meter on Isaac's back.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Acquired in chapter 1, the stasis module allows Isaac to drastically slow the movement speed of both Necromorphs and inorganic objects. An object or enemy hit with stasis turns a blueish color and is dramatically slowed down for a period of time. (The amount of time something remains slowed down can be upgraded). Stasis is used throughout the game to slow down hazardous moving parts, but it can also be used by Isaac for Necromorph crowd control.</p><h3>Kinesis</h3><p style="">The kinesis module is given to Isaac by a dying woman in chapter 2. The kinesis module allows Isaac to grab objects from afar and move them around, similar to the <a href="/zero-point-energy-field-manipulator/3055-20/" data-ref-id="3055-20">Gravity Gun</a> in Half Life 2. Through upgrades, the distance that Isaac's kinesis module reaches can be upgraded. The kinesis module is used primarily to solve environmental puzzles, to clear debris, and to manipulate large pieces of equipment on the Ishimura.</p><h2>Common Enemies</h2><table><tbody><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th><th>Sub-Specie Variants</th></tr><tr><td><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1670318-brute.png" data-ref-id="1300-1670318" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.81666666666667" data-width="300" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 300px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:81.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1670318-brute.png" data-ref-id="1300-1670318"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1670318-brute.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1670318-brute.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Brute</figcaption></figure></td><td>A large and strong Necromorph that can charge with great speed.

The site features 3D animations and voice overs that tell stories of fellow crew members aboard the USG Ishimura.</p><h3>Misplaced Affection</h3><p style="">This story tells the story of organ replacement technician, George Greggs who falls in love with an officer named Jane Gauthier. Gauthier and her squad were helping fight an apartment fire. As Gauthier was trying to escape the building, the front door closed on her hand, severing her middle, index and ring fingers. Gauthier is then sent to Greggs for replacements fingers, which is when Greggs falls for Gauthier. George and Jane are scheduled to go on a date but before they can, the Necromorphs attack the USG Ishimura.</p><h2>Development</h2><p style="">The game's executive producer, <a href="/glen-a-schofield/3040-21387/" data-ref-id="3040-21387">Glen Schofield</a>, and his long-time co-worker, <a href="/brett-robbins/3040-28455/" data-ref-id="3040-28455">Brett Robbins</a>, had been dreaming of making a sci-fi horror game for a long time. They were given a chance to pitch their idea to <a href="/paul-lee/3040-7219/" data-ref-id="3040-7219">Paul Lee</a>, the former president of EA. Lee was extremely impressed and asked what they needed. Schofield responded <i>"Let me hand-pick a team, put me in a corner, and leave us alone."</i> Lee agreed, as long as they had something to show within six months time. After the time had elapsed, Schofield and crew had a playable demo ready. The demo was given to all the higher ups at EA including then COO <a href="/john-riccitiello/3040-65707/" data-ref-id="3040-65707">John Riccitiello</a>. They were amazed by the game and instantly gave the project the green light, and tagged it as a possible trilogy.</p><p style="">It was revealed by Warren Ellis that much of the structure and narrative of Dead space was penned by himself. Ellis announced the following on his "Bad Signal" mailing list ( <a href="http://mailman.flirble.org/mailman/listinfo/badsignal" rel="nofollow">http://mailman.flirble.org/mailman/listinfo/badsignal</a>)</p><blockquote><p style="">Oh, I got released from an NDA the other day, so I can finally say that I wrote a bunch of the groundwork, backstory and structure on the forthcoming EA videogame <em>Dead Space</em>, which recently got a comic prequel from the hands of Antony Johnston and Ben Templesmith.

Mount Arreat, home of the proud <a href="../../barbarians/92-3911/" rel="nofollow">Barbarians</a>, was obliterated when the Worldstone exploded. Now Arreat is nothing more than a giant crater. The Barbarians, with no home and no Worldstone to protect, have become nomadic. There are few still living who can bear to remember the horrors that the <a href="../../prime-evils/92-2879/" rel="nofollow">Prime Evils</a> wrought upon the world.

The stipulations are that one has to agree to lock themselves into a year of World of Warcraft. This deal is called an Annual Pass. It also includes a World of Warcraft mount and beta access to <a href="/world-of-warcraft-mists-of-pandaria/3030-36734/" data-ref-id="3030-36734">World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria</a>.</li></ul><h2><b>Classes</b></h2><p style="">Diablo III features five character classes, and, unlike previous installments in the series, lets players choose their character's gender.</p><h3>Barbarian</h3><p style="">Their land, shattered by the destruction of the Worldstone, is now known as the Dreadlands. The once proud and noble Barbarians who resided in Mount Arreat have either stayed or struck out to battle evil in atonement for failing in their ancient stewardship. Over the course of two decades, those who stayed have regressed into bloodthirsty cannibals.</p><p style="">The Barbarian uses brute force and dual weapons to inflict maximum damage on his enemies. He also uses war cries to boost his fighting ability and defense, and prefers melee weapons like axes and swords. Their unique equipment consists of special Mighty Weapons and Mighty Belts.</p><p style="">Having been in <a href="/diablo-ii/3030-1119/" data-ref-id="3030-1119">Diablo II</a>, the Barbarian is the first class to appear in more than one Diablo game. However, though the Barbarian is similar to his Diablo II counterpart, it is not the same character. This was initially intended to be the case, but later abandoned as it became too much work to rewrite parts of the dialogue specifically for just one character who was not new to the events of the world.</p><h3><b>The Witch Doctor</b></h3><p style="">The Witch Doctor belongs to one of the legendary Umbaru tribes. The Umbaru reside in a dense jungle area known as Torajan. They are said to be a primitive race who regularly engage in tribal warfare sparked by ritualistic differences among the different tribes. Prisoners of these conflicts willingly submit themselves as sacrifices to honor the revered spirits of the rainforest. They believe that in death they will reach the true reality, commonly known as the Unformed Lands.</p><p style="">That being said, the Umbaru (and especially the Witch Doctor) are masters of the dark arts. To defeat their enemies, they summon spirits, raise the dead, and call upon the denizens of the jungle. They alone can wield ceremonial knives, mojos, and voodoo masks.</p><h3>Wizard</h3><p style="">The word <i>wizard</i> is dysphemism for dangerous rogue sorcerers and magi. These particular wizards are natives of Xiansai. The mages of Yshari Sanctum brought the prodigies to Caldeum for training. After defying their instructors and destroying part of the Sanctum, they fled the city.</p><p style="">The Wizard class has the ability to manipulate the elements and alter the very fabric of space and time. Although Wizards are not as hardy as the other classes, their powerful spells keep enemies at bay. Only Wizards have access to wands, orbs, and special Wizard Hats.</p><h3>Monk</h3><p style="">The Monks of Ivgorod are rarely seen outside their predominantly isolationist kingdom. Secretive and reclusive, these holy warriors undergo intense mental and physical training to hone their minds and bodies into living instruments of divine justice.</p><p style="">The Monk is a melee class with a mixed fighting style like that of Diablo II's Assassin and Paladin classes. The Monk's combos are skills that build up Spirit, have three different stages, and end big. You can mix up the combo with any other combo skill you have. For example, you can start with Fist of Thunder, then use Way of the Hundred Fists, and then go for the big finish with Crippling Wave. Supplementing this, Monks use Mantras (similar to auras from Diablo II) to boost their own power and that of nearby allies, and they execute powerful Spirit-consuming attacks like Seven Sided Strike. The Monk alone can equip fist weapons, spirit stones, and daibos.</p><h3>Demon Hunter</h3><p style="">Demon Hunters have a vendetta against the demons who killed their loved ones. While not native to the region, the secretive cadre of hunters has chosen to make its home in the harsh and unforgiving Dreadlands. The abundance of demonic creatures and mutated beasts provides a wealth of training opportunities for the Demon Hunters to hone their deadly skills.</p><p style="">The Demon Hunter mainly uses shadow-themed skills and gadgets like Grenades, Traps, and Bolas. Half the skills require the class to have some kind of ranged weapon equipped, but if one were so inclined, one could make a Demon Hunter who uses melee weapons. The Demon Hunter alone can equip hand crossbows, quivers, and cloaks.</p><p style="">Being part of the Holy Trinity of Character Design (i.e., melee fighter + spell caster + bow/crossbow fighter), <a href="/jay-wilson/3040-98309/" data-ref-id="3040-98309">Jay Wilson</a> said that it was one of the first class archetypes on the <a href="/whiteboard/3055-2858/" data-ref-id="3055-2858">whiteboard</a>, even though the Demon Hunter was the last class to be revealed.</p><h3><b>April Fool's Fake Class</b></h3><p style="">Every year on April 1st, Blizzard makes joke announcements related to all their games, and in 2009 the April Fool's Day announcement for Diablo III revealed the supposed fourth class; the <b>Archivist</b>, essentially a combat librarian.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10005/944681-ss83c_hires.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-944681" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.45373737373737" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:45.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10005/944681-ss83c_hires.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-944681"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10005/944681-ss83c_hires.jpg"></a><figcaption>The Archivist</figcaption></figure><blockquote><p style="">These brave souls wade into battle wielding tome and quill, armoured not in ensorcelled plate or links of chain, but in the knowledge of generations past. These Archivists fight not only for our future, but for our past as well.</p></blockquote><p style="">Archivists have powerful skills like "Lorenado", which unleashes a miniature vortex consisting of ancient tomes that batters the enemy into oblivion. "Quest Bolt" removes an enemy from a battle without actually killing them by transforming them from a hostile monster into a quest giver (parodying the exclamation points used in <i>Diablo II</i> to mark quest givers, but made more popular by the use of the same visual in <i>World of Warcraft</i>) Finally, Blizzard demonstrated the Archivist's ultimate weapon, the "Shush!" spell, which releases a demand for silence so powerful that all the noisy monsters in the area drop dead immediately. Apparently the main drawback to playing an Archivist would have been their frailty; at the end of the first two videos, a single enemy gets in a single hit on the Archivist, and that hit is enough to kill the unfortunate hero. At the end of the third video, despite Shush! Having killed all the monsters, the Archivist inexplicably died as well, exploding into <a href="../../gibs/92-334/" rel="nofollow">gibs</a> as a tip of the hat to the non-serious nature of the class.</p><p style="">Notably, elements of previous April Fool's jokes have made it into the final versions of some of Blizzard's products; the <a href="../../pandaren/92-599/" rel="nofollow">Pandaren</a> race, for example, announced for <a href="../../warcraft-iii-reign-of-chaos/61-12567/" rel="nofollow">Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos</a>, made an appearance in-game in the form of the neutral Pandaren Brewmaster hero. It has therefore been theorized that the Archivist or his abilities will make some sort of appearance in the final game, although it should be noted that adding a single unit to an RTS as a joke is a very different proposition than adding an entire character class to an RPG as a joke, making playable Archivists extremely unlikely.</p><h2>Resource System</h2><p style="">Blizzard chose to have a different resource for each of the 5 classes in Diablo III, instead of a general <a href="/mana/3015-257/" data-ref-id="3015-257">mana</a> system used in Diablo II and many other RPGs:</p><ul><li>The Barbarian's resource is <b>Fury</b>. Fury is generated by dealing and taking damage, and spent when skills are used. Fury decays when not in combat for a few seconds.</li><li>The Demon Hunter's has two resources: <b>Hatred</b> and <b>Discipline</b>. Both Hatred and Discipline slowly regenerates over time. Hatred has skills that generate more Hatred as well as skill that spend Hatred. Discipline, on the other hand, is used for defensive and utility skills.</li><li>The Monk's resource is <b>Spirit</b>. Spirit is built as the Monk uses combo skills, and is spent when non combo skills are used. Spirit is static and does not regenerate or decay over time.</li><li>The Witch Doctor's resource is <b>Mana</b>. Mana is a large pool that slowly regenerates. The witch doctor's spells and summons are semi-permanent which gives time for mana to regenerate.</li><li>The Wizard's resource is <b>Arcane Power</b>. Arcane power is a small pool similar to mana, but regenerates very quickly, allowing the Wizard to constantly cast spells with little down time.</li></ul><h2>Attributes</h2><p style="">In late 2009, Blizzard revealed that attribute points will be pre-assigned at every level up. The reasoning behind this decision was that unless a player follows a specific build known in advance, they will all but inevitably create a weaker character in the long run, which undermines a player's satisfaction with their character. So in substitution for requiring a player to do research outside of the game on optimal character builds or requiring a large amount of trial and error, the game will handle this facet of character building for the player.</p><p style="">Players can still further customize their attributes using Gear and Gems.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Before (Diablo II)</th><th>Now</th></tr><tr><td><p style=""><b>Strength</b> (Melee Damage, Equippable Gear)</p></td><td><p style=""><b>Strength</b> ( + Barbarian damage, + to Armor)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=""><b>Dexterity</b> (Hit, Block, and Dodge Chance)</p></td><td><p style=""><b>Dexterity</b> ( + Monk, and DH damage, + to Dodge)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=""><b>Vitality</b> (Life and Stamina)</p></td><td><p style=""><b>Intelligence</b> ( + to Wiz and WD damage, + to Resist)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=""><b>Willpower</b> (Mana)</p></td><td><p style=""><b>Vitality</b> (+ to life)</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Skills</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10005/2148106-skill_window_march2012.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2148106" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.84416924664603" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:84.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10005/2148106-skill_window_march2012.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2148106"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10005/2148106-skill_window_march2012.jpg"></a><figcaption>Skill window as of March 2012</figcaption></figure><p style="">In Diablo III, Blizzard took a different approach to skills from their previous Diablo games. Gone are the skill trees and skill points from <a href="/diablo-ii/3030-1119/" data-ref-id="3030-1119">Diablo II</a>. In place of that is a new system of Skills, Runes, and Passives. At every level-up, the player will unlock a combination of between one and five new Skills, Runes, and Passives, all specific to each character class.</p><p style="">Skills are activated abilities that can be put onto a hotbar and used on demand. Runes are Skill modifiers that alter the effects of a Skill. Passives are persistent bonuses for your character. At one time, a character can have up to 6 Skills equipped, each with 1 Runes, as well as 3 Passives. By default, of the 6 equipped Skills, one must come from each the class's Skill families. However, if you wish, you may enable Elective Mode in the Options menu which removes this restriction, allowing you to equip more than 1 Skill from specific families.</p><p style="">Every single Skill, Rune, and Passive is unique and there is no overlap between classes. Thus, spanning all five character classes there are 113 different Skills, each with 5 different Runes, and 75 different Passives, creating a total of 753 distinct Skills, Runes, and Passives to play with in the game.</p><p style="">In a break from RPG conventions, Diablo III will allow you to <a href="/re-spec/3015-4313/" data-ref-id="3015-4313">respec</a> your character's Skills, Runes, and Passives at any time with no penalty or cost aside from a few seconds of cooldown for your newly equipped Skills (to discourage changing Skills in the middle of a battle). Free respecs combined with the large number of ways of customizing each character class encourages players to experiment creatively to discover play styles that they enjoy most. For Skill list, click on the following class below.</p><h2>The Caravan</h2><h3>Followers</h3><p style="">Diablo III expands upon the mercenary system from <a href="/diablo-ii/3030-1119/" data-ref-id="3030-1119">Diablo II</a> by allowing players to recruit an NPC companion to follow them on their adventure and assist them in combat. They will have their own voice, dialog, and story, akin to companions in other RPGs (like Dragon Age). They will also have their own unique animations, gear appearance, and skills. There are three followers to choose from, and each can be hired out at the player's Caravan. They are found via quests, similar to the artisans. At any point the player can return to the Caravan and switch out one follower for another. Followers do not die when their health is reduced to zero. Instead, they temporarily go unconscious for a period of time, and can be revived by the player.</p><p style="">Followers are not player-controlled or directed, but have AI behaviors that suit a specific role depending on what skills the player gives them. Each of the three followers has 12 different skills. At specific levels (5,10,15,20) they will unlock a new skill tier, allowing players to choose one of two skills for their follower to learn. A follower can have a maximum of 4 skills. As of now there is no way to alter these choices once made, but there were plans at one time to have a pay-to-unlearn system.</p><p style="">Followers can equip left and right weapons, along with 2 rings and an amulet. Starting from level 18, they can also equip a special character item that is unique to them. Followers will only be available in solo play and are purely optional.</p><h4><b><a href="http://us.battle.net/d3/en/follower/scoundrel/" rel="nofollow">Lyndon</a>:</b> the Scoundrel form Kingsport, kicked out of the thieves’ guild.

The salvaging system looks to fix this issue. With the help of the Blacksmith, players can break down unwanted magical items into crafting materials. Crafting materials can be stacked in high numbers while only using a single inventory slot, leaving more room in the players' inventories for additional loot. All of the materials the player salvages can be used to craft new magical items, giving new life to unwanted loot.</p><h2>Town Portal</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10005/2148149-town_portal_in_town.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2148149" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.45952380952381" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:46.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10005/2148149-town_portal_in_town.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2148149"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10005/2148149-town_portal_in_town.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10005/2148149-town_portal_in_town.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Town Portal in town</figcaption></figure><p style="">Should the need to go back to town arise away from a waypoint, a player can simply click on the icon in their UI to cast a town portal spell.

One will be in-game gold-based, the other will be real currency-based. Both will be accessible from anywhere in the game. Players can open the auction house interface to make purchases or list items for sale. Items can be sold from the shared stash (storage shared among all the characters on your Battle.net account) or from any individual character’s inventory. When posting the item, the seller picks whether it will be sold in the gold-based auction house, or the real-money auction house (RMAH). The item is then held by the auction house system until the listing expires or a purchase is made. Items that are not sold are returned to the seller’s shared stash, and items that are sold are delivered to the winning bidder’s shared stash. In either case, the auction house system will deduct a nominal fixed transaction fee from the seller, the amount of which is determined by whether or not the item was sold. For the currency-based auction house, players will have a few different options for how to pay for item purchases and receive funds for item sales. This system is Player to Player only; Blizzard will not be selling any items.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10005/2148146-ah_selling_ui.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2148146" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.67258064516129" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:67.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10005/2148146-ah_selling_ui.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2148146"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10005/2148146-ah_selling_ui.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10005/2148146-ah_selling_ui.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>AH selling UI</figcaption></figure><p style="">Hardcore-mode characters will not be able to use the real-money auction house.

The goal of the Paragon system is to make the end-game longer, as well as giving the player other means of progression during a play session. Paragon levels are similar to normal levels in that the character gets a stat boost in the normal abilities (Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence and Vitality), but it differs from regular levels in that the character also gets permanently higher Magic Find and Gold Find. Because of this, Blizzard hopes to gradually decrease the need for items with Magic Find and Gold Find bonuses. There are no other benefits to getting a Paragon level, i.e. the character will not be able to equip better equipment or get new skills.</p><h2>Talisman (currently removed from game)</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10005/1724202-talisman_full.png" data-ref-id="1300-1724202" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.05" data-width="220" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 220px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:105.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10005/1724202-talisman_full.png" data-ref-id="1300-1724202"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10005/1724202-talisman_full.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10005/1724202-talisman_full.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Talisman with 13 charms</figcaption></figure><p style="">On May 25th 2011, Blizzard made the decision to put the Talisman on the shelf, due to it not meeting their high standards as well as not having the time to make it work without delaying the game's release. It may return to the game later in an update or in an expansion. The Talisman was not only set to be a dedicated inventory space for your charms, it was going to be a means of customizing your character's attributes. The Talisman was planned to start off with five slots for charms and grow to hold thirteen.</p><h2>Charms (Currently removed from game)</h2><p style="">Charms were an item type that augment your character's attributes. The developers felt they overlapped too much with gear's roll, so they removed them for now and put them on the shelf next to the Talisman.

The maximum Monster Power is 10.</p><h2>The Infernal Machine</h2><p style="">This is an event that has been added in patch 1.0.5 whereby players can fight against uber versions of the sub-bosses by creating "The Infernal Machine".

They can only be taken from the 4 Keywardens:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Keywarden</th><th>Act</th><th>Area</th><th>Item to Collect</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Odeg</td><td>Act 1</td><td>Fields of Misery</td><td>Key of Destruction</td></tr><tr><td>Sokahr</td><td>Act 2</td><td>Dahlgur Oasis</td><td>Key of Hate</td></tr><tr><td>Xah'Rith</td><td>Act 3</td><td>Stonefort</td><td>Key of Terror</td></tr><tr><td>Nekarat</td><td>Act 4</td><td>Silver Spire</td><td>Blacksmith Plans</td></tr></tbody></table><p style="">These items are tied to the account.</p><p style="">It's also worth noting that due to the Monster Power update as well, when the number is increased, it also increases the chance of collecting the items.</p><p style="">Once created (and after paying up 12,000 gold to craft it), the player must go to the Heretic's Abode which is in New Tristam and upon activation of the machine, a red portal appears and teleports the player in one of three places:</p><ul><li>Realm of Discard fighting against King Leoric and Maghda</li><li>Realm of Chaos fighting against Ghom and Rakanoth</li><li>Realm of Turmoil fighting against Siege Breaker and Zoltun Kulle</li></ul><p style="">They are the bosses as before with also additional moves as well.</p><p style="">Upon killing the 2 bosses, the player is rewarded with an organ which is used to combine into a legendary item called the "Hellfire Ring"</p><p style=""><i>Note: Once the player has used the infernal machine, it is then destroyed and must be created again to re-access to portal.</i></p><h2>Brawling</h2><p style="">Brawling, previously known as dueling, was introduced in patch 1.0.7. Brawling allows up to 4 players to battle each other in a Free-For-All format. To initiate a brawl, plays must enter a specifically designated area called "The Scorched Chapel", which can be accessed by speaking with Nek the Brawler in any of the four Act hubs.</p><p style="">Once in the Scorched Chapel there are four different areas to fight, the church, the graveyard, the river, and the lake. The actual game mode is very bare-bones. There is no score or objectives to strive for, just plain fighting.</p><p style="">Brawling was announced shortly after Blizzard revealed that the games PvP mode was being delayed after coming to the conclusion that it didn't meet their high standards. The more elaborate PvP mode is still planned for release, but there is no time frame for it's arrival.</p><h2>Collector's Edition</h2><p style="">The Diablo III Collector's Edition was announced at Blizzcon 2011 with the following features:</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/61859/1999828-d3ce1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1999828"

The missions are adapted from the 14th century novel Romance of The Three Kingdoms written by Luo Guanzhong.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Dynasty Warriors 6 is the first game in the series to feature a redesigned engine to take advantage of the power of the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3. As in previous entries in the series, the game takes a hack-and-slash approach to depicting scenarios adapted from the novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms. In Musou Mode, the player guides a warrior through his or her own story as the nations of Wei, Wu, and Shu fight to unite China under one banner.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5910/247511-dynastywarriors6image.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-247511" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5959595959596" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:59.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5910/247511-dynastywarriors6image.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-247511"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5910/247511-dynastywarriors6image.jpg"></a><figcaption>A number of returning characters such as Lu Bu have been redesigned and use new weapons and fighting styles in addition to sporting new looks.</figcaption></figure><p style="">With the introduction of a new engine, the gameplay in Dynasty Warriors 6 has changed quite a bit from its predecessors. The basics remain the same, in that a player selects an officer, heads into battle and defeats enemy officers and waves of enemies while completing objectives. However, the player now has several new abilities.</p><p style="">The most notable new ability comes in the form of the Renbu system. By attacking enemies and creating attack change, the Renbu guage will fill until it reaches a higher level, at which point the player character's attacks will become more powerful. A higher Renbu Rank also allows for more attacks. However, if the player goes without attacking enemies for a time, the guage will gradually deplete and the Renbu Rank will drop. Each character begins with a maximum Renbu Rank of 2, but as characters level up and earn sSkill points, Third and Infinite Ranks will become unlocked. The player may also find an item on the battlefield that grants the player character Infinite Renbu Rank for a brief time, even if Infinite Renbu has not been unlocked for that character.</p><p style="">As mentioned above, character progression is now handled using skill points. As a player defeats enemies and earns experience points, skill points are awarded when a character levels up. At the end of battle, the player may then distribute these points to unlock new skills and stat bonuses on charts that are similar in ways to the Sphere Grid found in Final Fantasy X.</p><p style="">Each character has access to a special attack that can be triggered if he or she has a tome in stock. The special attacks vary from character to character and can be enhanced by unlocking new special attack abilities when spending skill points. Special attacks are particularly useful for taking out large groups of enemies and can help fill the musou guage quickly.</p><p style="">Other new features include the ability for characters to climb ladders and swim across water, making the environment less of an impedement than it was in previous games. Enemies may also become temporarily confused and drop experience items on defeat when performing surprise attacks by dropping into enemy bases from above. Also, in addition to the primary objective of each stage, each battle features three objectives which provide experience bonuses when cleared. Some characters can only be unlocked by completing specific stage targets.</p><h2>Online Features</h2><p style="">Dynasty Warriors 6 does not feature online play. However, high scores earned in the game's Challenge Mode can be uploaded to online leaderboards.</p><h2>Xbox 360 Game Installation</h2><p style="">Dynasty Warriors 6 requires 6.8GB of space to install on an Xbox 360 HDD.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>20816</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/0/5830/188043-dw6.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5830/188043-dw6.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/0/5830/188043-dw6.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5830/188043-dw6.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/5830/188043-dw6.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5830/188043-dw6.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/0/5830/188043-dw6.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Dynasty Warriors 6]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>6</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-33/]]></api_detail_url><id>33</id><name><![CDATA[CERO: B]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-1/]]></api_detail_url><id>1</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: T]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-36/]]></api_detail_url><id>36</id><name><![CDATA[PEGI: 12+]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-31/]]></api_detail_url><id>31</id><name><![CDATA[OFLC: M]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2007-11-11 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-19/]]></api_detail_url><id>19</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 2]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-2/3045-19/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS2]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/dynasty-warriors-6/3030-20816/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20819/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-06-30 13:01:12</date_added><date_last_updated>2015-08-29 16:56:03</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[NBA Live 09 is the next installment in the popular basketball franchise from Electronic Arts.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">NBA Live 09 is a basketball game developed by both <a href="/ea-canada/3010-69/" data-ref-id="3010-69">EA Canada</a> (<a href="/xbox-360/3045-20/" data-ref-id="3045-20">Xbox 360</a>, <a href="/playstation-portable/3045-18/" data-ref-id="3045-18">PSP</a>, and <a href="/playstation-3/3045-35/" data-ref-id="3045-35">PlayStation 3</a> versions) and <a href="/hb-studios/3010-1878/" data-ref-id="3010-1878">HB Studios</a> (<a href="/playstation-2/3045-19/" data-ref-id="3045-19">PlayStation 2</a> version).

Path of the Furon takes players on a journey through thirty different missions over twenty side missions all which feature the series Destruction and Enlightenment set in the Funked Out '70's. The newest installment in the acclaimed franchise, redefines the brand's irreverent Sci-Fi action gaming experience for the next-generation Xbox 360 video game and entertainment system from Microsoft with new weapons and mental abilities, high-fidelity destruction and expanded open-world gameplay. THQ on November 26, 2008 confirmed that the PS3 version of the game had been canceled due to troubles working with the Cell processor.</p><p style="">In Destroy All Humans! Path of the Furon, players will pick up where prequel Destroy All Humans! Big Willy Unleashed leaves off, controlling Crypto in the Funked out 1970's when mysterious new enemy attacks Earth, sweeping Crypto up in a conspiracy that unravels his groovy new way of life and threatens the very survival of the Furon race. Players will take Crypto on a journey of Enlightenment and Destruction as he gains new powers, including the temporal fist, from an alien Kung Fu Master in order to take on his most difficult enemy yet-his own kind.</p><p style="">Players will be using the money Pox and his loyal minion Crypto gained in Big Willy. They invest this money on a casino called "Space Dust" in which they have an stable stream of human DNA a well as dollars. The game revolves around Crypto's lack of enthusiasm when killing humans, this is due to an abuse on drinking and watching television all day, everyday and is pretty much a coach potato. The whole plot turns around when the Casino starts having trouble with the Mafia. Crypto discovers the conspiracy when fighting some of the Mafia robots called the Nexos, which come form Crypto's homeworld, at this point Crypto has returned to his human-hating self.</p><h2>Features:</h2><ul><li>Destroy All Humans!

Publisher EA Games canceled the project in September 2008, citing quality concerns.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<p style=""><em>This game is canceled, and should not have a release date or be attached to any concept, object, location, or character except the <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/canceled-games/3015-2310/" data-ref-id="3015-2310">Canceled Games</a> page. See the page for details.</em></p><h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Tiberium was a tactical first-person shooter set in the <a href="/command-conquer/3025-98/" data-ref-id="3025-98">Command &amp; Conquer</a> universe, and was being developed by <a href="/ea-los-angeles/3010-1382/" data-ref-id="3010-1382">EA Los Angeles</a>, makers of <a href="/medal-of-honor/3030-29336/" data-ref-id="3030-29336">Medal Of Honor</a> and <a href="/command-conquer-3-tiberium-wars/3030-17551/" data-ref-id="3030-17551"> Command &amp; Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars</a>.</p><p style="">Powered by <a href="/unreal-engine-3/3015-86/" data-ref-id="3015-86"> Unreal Engine 3</a>, the game focused around Ricardo Vega, a retired <a href="/global-defense-initiative/3015-2946/" data-ref-id="3015-2946"> Global Defence Initiative</a> battle commander put back into action to explore a <a href="/scrin/3015-2947/" data-ref-id="3015-2947"> Scrin </a>Threshold Tower eleven years after the Third Tiberium War has ended. Referred to as "Tower 6" by the Scrin, and "Tower Omega" by the GDI, it appears to be just a relic of the past. However, this seemingly harmless structure turns out to be the base of another Scrin invasion.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">Little is known about Tiberium's gameplay, but its main focus was on <a href="/squad/3015-667/" data-ref-id="3015-667">squad</a> mechanics. The player would have commanded up to four squads at once, and would have had to use them to counter the many types of enemies to be encountered by the player. The confirmed controllable squads were a Rifleman unit, a Missile unit, a Titan unit, and an Orca unit. If killed, units would be replaced by new ones after some time.</p><p style="">The player would also be able to attack independently, of course. The only weapon revealed was the GD-10, a versatile weapon system that can be changed into an <a href="/assault-rifle/3055-413/" data-ref-id="3055-413">assault rifle</a>, a <a href="/grenade-launcher/3055-252/" data-ref-id="3055-252">grenade launcher</a>, an anti-aircraft <a href="/missile-launcher/3055-3889/" data-ref-id="3055-3889">missile launcher</a>, and an ion cannon <a href="/sniper-rifle/3055-67/" data-ref-id="3055-67">sniper rifle</a>. It also featured a digital ammo counter that would replace the conventional HUD ammo count. It is unknown whether the player would have had access to weapons other than the GD-10, as EA LA was not forthcoming with details.</p><p style="">Tiberium was originally slated for a September 2nd release, but it was later pushed back to the publisher's 2010 fiscal year. On September 30th, it was announced that EA had officially cancelled the game because it did not meet their quality standards.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>20821</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/0/24/175982-tiberium001.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/24/175982-tiberium001.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/0/24/175982-tiberium001.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/24/175982-tiberium001.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/24/175982-tiberium001.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/24/175982-tiberium001.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/0/24/175982-tiberium001.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Tiberium]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating/><original_release_date/><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/tiberium/3030-20821/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[Lego Batman]]></aliases><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20822/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-06-30 17:19:39</date_added><date_last_updated>2014-12-29 04:39:14</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[LEGO Batman: The Video Game is an action adventure platformer focused on the combination of the popular Batman universe and the continued licensing of Lego-styled video games.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Gameplay</h2><p style=""> </p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/870/699043-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-699043" data-size="medium" data-ratio="1" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/870/699043-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-699043"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/870/699043-3.jpg"></a><figcaption>The one and only: Dark Knight.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The game is split up into three unique-to-game stories based around <a href="/batman/3005-66/" data-ref-id="3005-66"> Batman</a>, his allies and enemies.

It was formally announced by <a href="/take-two-interactive-software-inc/3010-450/" data-ref-id="3010-450">Take-Two</a> in March of 2008, and the initial teaser trailer, which named the game as "BioShock 2: Sea of Dreams", was included as a bonus in the PlayStation 3 version of BioShock, viewable once the game is beaten. It was announced that development would be handed over to <a href="/2k-marin/3010-6350/" data-ref-id="3010-6350">2K Marin</a> rather than having 2K Boston develop, but BioShock's director <a href="/ken-levine/3040-33273/" data-ref-id="3040-33273">Ken Levine</a> confirmed that he worked on BioShock 2 but only as the "creative consultant". The title released world wide on February 9, 2010.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82996/1282770-delta001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1282770" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.16640625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:116.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82996/1282770-delta001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1282770"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82996/1282770-delta001.jpg"></a><figcaption>Subject Delta.</figcaption></figure><p style="">In BioShock 2, you control a prototype <a href="/big-daddy/3015-624/" data-ref-id="3015-624">Big Daddy</a> known as " <a href="/subject-delta/3005-11413/" data-ref-id="3005-11413">Subject Delta</a>", the first one to ever be bound to a <a href="/little-sisters/3015-1111/" data-ref-id="3015-1111">Little Sister</a> and also the first one to be able to think independently. As a prototype, you have the unique ability to use Plasmids, which was removed from later models, as well as a mind of your own which enables you to make your own choices in the world. You can use tools like the iconic drill, which requires fuel to run to keep things balanced. You even have the Big Daddy Dash which was used to lethal effect in the original game. Another weapon you'll be able to use is the rivet gun, which was too heavy for the mere human <a href="/jack-ryan/3005-4149/" data-ref-id="3005-4149">Jack</a> to use during the first game. Carrying larger weapons (such as the infamous bouncer drill) is one of the perks of being a Big Daddy. You are not as bulky and slow as the other Big Daddies but you have more advanced weapons. This game also presents the player with a moral decision as to what will become of a Little Sister; however, while this game allows players to Harvest a Little Sister as before, which drains her of her ADAM, killing her in the process, as a Big Daddy, the player is also given the option to Adopt the Little Sisters. By adopting said little sister Subject Delta will be carrying one at a time on his shoulders and setting her down to harvest ADAM from corpses. However while she is not on the character's shoulder she is vulnerable, so naturally as a Big Daddy, defending the girl from <a href="/splicers/3015-647/" data-ref-id="3015-647">Splicer</a> attacks is key until she is finished. Minor Splicers are far less of a threat in the game now that you have heavy armor and more powerful weaponry. The game gives you a better sense of self-awareness, such as your body casting shadow in certain lighting conditions and the screen being framed with the edge of your helmet.</p><p style=""><a href="/plasmid/3055-24/" data-ref-id="3055-24">Plasmids</a> are now more versatile. Instead of just upgrading the amount of damage they do, some now change the way they function as they become more powerful. One example is the Incinerate! plasmid. The first level of Incinerate! allows you to set things on fire with a snap, just as in the first game. However, when upgraded another level, it gains the ability to also shoot a <a href="/fireball/3055-120/" data-ref-id="3055-120">Fireball</a>. The fully upgraded version grants both previous abilities, in addition to allowing you to shoot a steady stream of fire like a <a href="/flamethrower/3055-45/" data-ref-id="3055-45">Flamethrower</a>. Subject Delta also has the ability to heal hacked turrets and sentries, which makes a pet/minion approach to the game more viable. You can also combine certain Plasmids to increase their effectiveness and even use bait and traps for a more devious play style. Arguably the biggest change</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4344/959610-flame_on2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-959610" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4344/959610-flame_on2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-959610"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4344/959610-flame_on2.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4344/959610-flame_on2.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>New dual-wielding Big Daddy combat.</figcaption></figure><p style="">to gameplay is the ability to "dual wield" Plasmids and weapons; at all times, the Prototype will have a weapon in his right hand and a Plasmid equipped on his left hand, similar to the system of <a href="/clive-barkers-undying/3030-10157/" data-ref-id="3030-10157">Clive Barker's Undying</a>, which let players equip one weapon and one spell simultaneously. In addition, as in the original BioShock, you can still upgrade your weapons. The developers want you to feel that you have created a specialized character by the end of the game.</p><p style="">Little Sisters are now designed to look less monstrous since you are seeing them through the eyes of a Big Daddy, who is genetically encoded to see them as darling children who must be protected. This time, you will have to steal them away from other Big Daddies. While killing Big Daddies is now on a much more even playing field than the previous game, they are still hard battles that have to be planned out, since Subject Delta's armor isn't quite up to par with the later models, though his ability to use Plasmids should give him an edge. Once you kill a Big Daddy, the Little Sister will be happy to see you as they are mentally conditioned to trust all Big Daddies as their beloved "Mr. Bubbles". In addition to harvesting or adopting Little Sisters, as previously mentioned, you can also help them escape the city. These moral choices will affect the game world and lead to a good or bad ending but the developers want you to feel like there was a good "Trade-Off" for each outcome.</p><p style="">Now that you are a Big Daddy, enemies that were tough in the first game are now not even worth a glance unless they attack you in large numbers. Delta's hands are far too large to use ordinary weapons such as the <a href="/pistol/3055-59/" data-ref-id="3055-59">pistol</a> or <a href="/shotgun/3055-114/" data-ref-id="3055-114">shotgun</a>, but weapons dropped by Splicers can be searched for ammo that is compatible with your weapons. As the developers put it: "Why would you wield a homemade shotgun when you have a rivet gun with exploding ammo?".</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/40179/1265604-bioshock_2_big_sister_screenshot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1265604" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.56129032258065" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/40179/1265604-bioshock_2_big_sister_screenshot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1265604"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/40179/1265604-bioshock_2_big_sister_screenshot.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/40179/1265604-bioshock_2_big_sister_screenshot.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>A Big Sister.</figcaption></figure><p style="">While you may feel like the the strongest creature in Rapture, Big Sisters are a more even match for you. While it was originally implied that there was only one Big Sister who the player would encounter several times, 2k revealed that there are actually many Big Sisters, and that individual encounters end with the Sister dying, not escaping. This is meant to parallel the Big Daddy encounters from the original game, a hostile character far more powerful than the player, so that the player feels a sense of accomplishment when they defeat them.</p><p style="">The glow from your helmet illuminates dark areas like a flashlight in select areas and sequences, a feature many gamers wished for in the original game. Another interesting feature added to BioShock 2 is the option that allows you to turn off the Vita-Chambers completely in the game. In the first BioShock you were not able to do that unless you had the free DLC or the PS3 version.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style="">At the beginning of the fall of Rapture, Andrew Ryan brought in a psychologist, Sofia Lamb, to calm the minds of the people. However her intentions were not the same as Ryan's, her collectivist philosophy at odds with Ryan's objectivist views, and she came to be worshiped by the denizens of Rapture. After the deaths of Ryan and Frank Fontaine at the end of BioShock, Lamb became the de facto leader of Rapture. She opposes the old Big Daddy system with her own army of Big Sisters, and specifically wishes for Subject Delta to be destroyed, for reasons that aren't clear at the outset of the game. Lamb believes in the power of community while Ryan believed in the power of individual minds.</p><p style="">BioShock 2 begins with a first person cinematic showing Subject Delta protecting Eleanor, the Little Sister he was partnered with, from Splicers while she gathers ADAM. However, after defeating all of them, Sofia Lamb arrives and takes Eleanor, but not before having Subject Delta shoot himself with a pistol.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4344/959611-flame_on3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-959611" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4344/959611-flame_on3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-959611"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4344/959611-flame_on3.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4344/959611-flame_on3.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Burning a Splicer.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Delta awakens 10 years later and embarks on a journey to get back his "daughter", Eleanor, who is actually the daughter of Sofia Lamb. With the help of a gentleman named <a href="/augustus-sinclair/3005-12999/" data-ref-id="3005-12999">Augustus Sinclair</a>, Delta navigates several sections of Rapture, using a train to get from location to location. It is revealed that "Subject Delta" was the first person to discover Rapture as a diver. While the local citizens hailed him as a celebrity, and nicknamed him "Johnny Topside" <a href="/andrew-ryan/3005-424/" data-ref-id="3005-424">Andrew Ryan</a> did not trust him, and <a href="/stanley-poole/3005-13962/" data-ref-id="3005-13962">Stanley Poole</a>, a Rapture Journalist, turns him in to Ryan who in turn sends him to the Big Daddy program. Poole is met in <a href="/dionysus-park/3035-2803/" data-ref-id="3035-2803">Dionysus Park</a> where he insists the players "handles" all the little sisters in the area, as their ingestion of the Park Residents' Adam gave them a sort of residual genetic memory which gave witness to what Poole did. It is revealed Poole both flooded the park to cover his tracks and gave <a href="/eleanor-lamb/3005-13897/" data-ref-id="3005-13897">Eleanor</a> to the little sister program. The player is given the option to dispose of Poole if they so choose, a decision that moves the player towards the "neutral" and "evil" endings.</p><p style="">Eventually, he arrives in Fontaine Futuristics and locates Eleanor. Unfortunately, Sofia Lamb is also there, and suffocates Eleanor with a pillow so that Delta goes into comatose. Delta wakes up strapped to a table with a Little Sister sent by Eleanor on him. The Little Sister injects him with ADAM, which allows Delta to take control of the Sister. The girl gathers up pieces of armor for a Big Sister and gives them to Eleanor, who puts all of it on and becomes one of them. Delta is freed by Eleanor and together they fight their way to Sinclair's escape pod. Unfortunately, Sinclair himself is captured and turned into a Big Daddy, and Delta is forced to kill him to get a pass code. Delta hangs on to the escape pod as it rockets away from the city up to the surface, and watches as Sofia Lamb drowns inside the escape pod.</p><p style="">The game's ending can be slightly different or completely different depending on the decisions the player makes during the game. This is dependent on what the player does when he encounters Big Daddies escorting little sisters. If the player rescues all of them, the positive ending will occur. The other endings are the when the player rescues and harvests some little sisters. This is the neutral ending. The evil ending will occur when the player harvests all Little Sisters that are encountered.</p><h2>Multiplayer</h2><p style="">BioShock 2's multiplayer component is similar to that of the <a href="/call-of-duty/3025-82/" data-ref-id="3025-82">Call Of Duty</a> series. Players earn experience points (called ADAM) from performing certain actions during a game, and they are able to create custom load-outs to use during a match and also minimally customize the appearance of their character. Here is a breakdown of the experience point system:</p><ul><li>Killing an enemy = 10 XP</li><li>Hacking something = 10 XP</li><li>Assists = 5 XP</li><li>Putting on a Big Daddy suit = 50 XP</li><li>Killing a Big Daddy = 100 XP</li><li>Researching a dead enemy = 10 XP</li><li>Completing a Trial = Varies</li><li>Picking up an ADAM Vial = 10 XP</li><li>Killstreak (3 kills without dying) = 50 XP</li></ul><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1182223-fry_big_daddy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1182223" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1182223-fry_big_daddy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1182223"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1182223-fry_big_daddy.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1182223-fry_big_daddy.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Multiplayer gameplay.</figcaption></figure><p style="">There are several characters to choose from, and each have their own backstory. When you first start up the multiplayer, you'll be greeted by an introduction cinematic in which Andrew Ryan wishes you a happy New Year. You'll find yourself in your apartment, which can be thought of as a private lobby. From here you can customize your character (by activating the wardrobe), customize your loadouts (by activating the Gene Bank), look at the leaderboards (by checking the news stand), and listen to audio recordings that you unlock at certain levels. There is also an audio recording from each character sitting on a couch that can be listened to.</p><p style="">There are seven game modes in <i>BioShock 2</i>. They are:</p><ul><li><b>Survival of the Fittest</b> - A free for all mode</li><li><b>Civil War</b> - Team Deathmatch</li><li><b>Last Splicer Standing</b> - Another free for all mode, but with no respawning</li><li><b>Turf War</b> - Two teams fight to gain control of points spread out across the map</li><li><b>Capture the Sister</b> - Capture the Flag, but the flag is a Little Sister</li><li><b>ADAM Grab -</b> A mode where players grab the Little Sister and hold onto her to gain points</li><li><b>Team ADAM Grab</b> - Same as above, but with teams</li></ul><p style="">The multiplayer is based on power, researching enemy splicers after they have been killed gives the researching player an added damage bonus against the specific player, but if the player is killed by the one he/she researched they will lose that advantage. This method is a key strategy to taking out the real threat of multiplayer. The Big Daddies.</p><p style="">The Big Daddy suit will appear at random in predetermined areas, granting the ability to become a Big Daddy to whomever finds it first, this is one of the most prominent turning points in a match, but does not come without a price. In addition to a massive health bonus and powerful weapons like the Rivet Gun and Motion Sensor Mines, players lose whatever damage bonus against other players that they had obtained prior to putting the suit on as well as not having the ability to regenerate health or use Plasmids, Big Daddies are also targeted by the opposing team making prolonged survival a rarity. Once the Big Daddy has been killed the player will spawn as a normal Splicer again. Dying takes the suit out of the play, however, it will respawn at a later time during the match. If a Big Daddy survives long enough, another suit will appear placing two of the power players on the same field.</p><h2>Multiplayer Unlocks</h2><p style="">These are all of the various unlockables that are obtainable in the multiplayer.

There have been three DLC releases so far. The first DLC released was the Sinclair Solutions Tester Pack, the second was the Rapture Metro Pack, and the third being Minerva's Den.</p><h3>Sinclair Solutions Tester Pack</h3><p style="">The first DLC to be released was Sinclair Solutions Tester Pack. It was released on March 11th, 2010 for all platforms and is available for $4.99 or 400 Microsoft Points. However, it is not available in Japan.</p><h4>DLC Content</h4><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/66282/1343620-bioshock_2_dlc_announced.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1343620" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.56271186440678" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/66282/1343620-bioshock_2_dlc_announced.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1343620"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66282/1343620-bioshock_2_dlc_announced.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66282/1343620-bioshock_2_dlc_announced.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Louie McGradd and Oscar Calraca.</figcaption></figure><ol><li>The rank cap was raised from level 40 to level 50.</li><li>As the player progresses past level 40, more trials open up, twenty in total.</li><li>Five new masks were added to the customization.</li><li>Two new playable characters were added - Louie McGraff and Oscar Calraca.</li><li>A third weapon upgrade for every weapon, available upon activation.</li></ol><h4>Controversy</h4><p style="">Despite rumored speculation surrounding DLC file sizes, it would later be confirmed that some content was already provided on the game disc, and that it was held back to be sold later. 2K's community manager said that "<i>The engine and game structure required that players have the exact same content to play together. Making the DLC unlockable content was a tactic to prevent splitting the player base.</i>"</p><h3>Rapture Metro Pack</h3><p style="">The Rapture Metro Pack was initially scheduled to be released on March 11th 2010, but had been postponed until</p><p style="">April 29th 2010 for unknown reasons. There were no reports of the DLC not being ready, but 2K decided to adjust the release for marketing reasons. The release of Modern Warfare 2's Stimulus Package has been noted as the reason for the push-back.</p><h4>DLC Content</h4><ol><li>A new multiplayer mode called "Killing 'Em Kindly". Players battle to the death using only golf clubs. A reference to killing the antagonist in the first BioShock game.</li><li>Six new maps, Pauper's Drop, Dionysus Park, Fighting McDonagh's, Fontaine Fisheries, Siren Alley, and Smuggler's Hideout.</li><li>Rank increase from Level 40 to 50.

(Playing a match on each of the new maps, winning a match on each of the maps, and using the rebirth feature after reaching Level 50)</li></ol><h3>Minerva's Den</h3><p style="">After a dictator assumes control of a new district in Rapture, the player takes control of a new character and assists Brigid Tenenbaum in figuring out what's going on. Minerva's Den was released on August 31, 2010. It is the final piece of downloadable content released for Bioshock 2.</p><h4>DLC Content</h4><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11986/1478951-1478721_minervas_den_super.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1478951" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.56333333333333" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11986/1478951-1478721_minervas_den_super.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1478951"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11986/1478951-1478721_minervas_den_super.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11986/1478951-1478721_minervas_den_super.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>A Big Daddy being electrocuted.</figcaption></figure><ol><li>A new area to explore called Rapture Central Computing</li><li>New weapons</li><li>New plasmids</li><li>Upgraded Splicers</li><li>A never-before-seen breed of Big Daddy called The Lancer</li><li>Owners of the Protector's Trials DLC will be able to buy a tonic that increases both the harvesting time and ADAM gained from Little Sisters</li></ol><p style="">The Minerva's Den DLC was argued for by <a href="/brad-shoemaker/3040-89869/" data-ref-id="3040-89869">Brad Shoemaker</a> during the lengthy Best Downloadable Add-On debate during the <a href="/podcast/1600-podcast_id=198/" data-ref-id="1600-podcast_id=198">Giant Bomb Game Of The Year 2010: Day Two podcast</a>.</p><h2>Development</h2><h3>PS3 Teaser</h3><p style="">A brief teaser was included in the PlayStation 3 release of <i>BioShock</i>, for what was assumed at the time to be called "BioShock 2: Sea of Dreams", a subtitle that was later removed in favor of the more spartan title, " BioShock 2".</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/919589-ncjb5s.png" data-ref-id="1300-919589" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.8744019138756" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:87.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/919589-ncjb5s.png" data-ref-id="1300-919589"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/919589-ncjb5s.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/919589-ncjb5s.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>There is Something in the Sea.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The first teaser for BioShock 2 shows a young girl dressed in clothes similar to that of a Little Sister. She is holding a Big Daddy doll and standing on a platform jutting into the sea, somewhere in the ocean. Rock formations then begin to rise out of the sand creating a pattern similar to the depiction of Rapture on the logo for the game; the logo itself then appears. The logo for BioShock 2 is notably different from the logo for the first game; there are an abundance of barnacles and a butterfly is seen fluttering around the edges. The subtitle "Sea of Dreams" then appears below the main title.</p><p style="">The song that is used in the teaser is titled 'Dreams' by the Pied Pipers.</p><p style="">BioShock 2 was revealed to have a multiplayer component on Gamasutra’s job listings section. The job listing looked for engineers to extend and enhance <a href="/unreal-tournament-3/3030-10955/" data-ref-id="3030-10955">Unreal Tournament III</a> proprietary networking and tech to address gameplay, performance, platform, production, tools, and Q&amp;A needs and to interface with Microsoft, Sony, and other providers for matching-making and other services. "The BioShock team is betting big on multiplayer and plans to stay at the top of the charts– we’re careful about the problems we tackle, innovative in our approach, solid in our implementation, and we polish the heck out of everything we do. Right now we’re looking for an exceptional individual to direct the development of this multiplayer experience through a combination of leadership, design, coding, and daily problem solving on the gameplay networking and back-end server components."</p><p style="">On May 8, 2009, 2K revealed that the multiplayer component of BioShock 2 was to be in the form of a prequel, set during Rapture's fall. Players will take on the role of "Plasmid test subjects for Sinclair Solutions, a premier provider of Plasmids and Tonics." In other words, each player will control an ADAM-mutated Splicer "testing" weapons and combat Plasmids by fighting and killing other Splicers with them. In team-based matches, teams are split between Splicers loyal to Ryan Industries and Atlas' forces, with separate announcers for each team; the Atlas announcer encourages players to "take the fight to the fascists", while the Ryan announcer tells them to "drive back the parasites".</p><p style="">Experience can be gained to unlock Plasmids, tonics and weapons. Mercury Suites and the Kashmir Restaurant, two locations from the first game, will appear in their pre-fall-of-Rapture state. In the midst of matches, players can photograph the corpses of their enemies; like the research cameras from BioShock and BioShock 2's singleplayer mode, this grants a combat bonus to the player; from then on until the end of the match, the player's attacks will do more damage to that specific enemy player. The effect can stack up to two times, and it can be nullified if the victim, after respawning, photographs the player's body. The name of a new multiplayer-specific plasmid was also revealed. "Aero Dash" allows the player to get out of situations where they are taking fire or need to get somewhere fast. The multiplayer component was externally developed by <a href="/digital-extremes/3010-2159/" data-ref-id="3010-2159">Digital Extremes</a>, makers of the critically-maligned <a href="/dark-sector/3030-20497/" data-ref-id="3030-20497">Dark Sector</a> and some of the <a href="/unreal-tournament/3025-240/" data-ref-id="3025-240">Unreal Tournament</a> games.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1546054-bs2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1546054" data-size="small" data-ratio="1" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1546054-bs2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1546054"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1546054-bs2.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1546054-bs2.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Cover Art for the second Bioshock game.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The <a href="/original-soundtrack/3015-189/" data-ref-id="3015-189">original score</a> for Bioshock 2 was composed by the returning <a href="/garry-schyman/3040-22530/" data-ref-id="3040-22530">Garry Schyman</a>.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Track No.</th><th>Song Title</th><th>Running Time</th></tr><tr><td>01</td><td>Pairbond (Bioshock 2 Theme)</td><td>02.33</td></tr><tr><td>02</td><td>Waking Up in 1959 (Multiplayer Main Theme)</td><td>01.31</td></tr><tr><td>03</td><td>Ten Years Later</td><td>01.46</td></tr><tr><td>04</td><td>Protecting His Charge</td><td>01.07</td></tr><tr><td>05</td><td>Welcome Back</td><td>02.20</td></tr><tr><td>06</td><td>Cult of Lamb</td><td>01.18</td></tr><tr><td>07</td><td>Out the Airlock</td><td>01.41</td></tr><tr><td>08</td><td>How She Sees the World</td><td>02.46</td></tr><tr><td>09</td><td>Grace Under the Ocean</td><td>01.51</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>The Abyss</td><td>01.24</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Big Sister On the Move</td><td>02.00</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Send Him Howling Back to Hell</td><td>02.06</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Eleanor's Darkness</td><td>01.42</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>That Symbol On Your Hand</td><td>02.00</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>Drained Memories</td><td>02.40</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>Entrance to Eden</td><td>01.37</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>Persephone</td><td>01.08</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>Cell Block</td><td>01.14</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>Lockdown March</td><td>01.28</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>Welcome to the Drop (alternate version with vocals)</td><td>01.38</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>Under the Tracks (unused version with vocals)</td><td>02.43</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>Research</td><td>01.11</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>Destroying the Lobby</td><td>01.09</td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td>Gil's Entertainment</td><td>01.48</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>Escape</td><td>03.32</td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td>Eleanor's Lullaby</td><td>01.39</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Viral Website</h2><p style="">The game's <a href="/">viral site</a> was spotted on 5th March, 2009.

The game released on the <a href="/xbox-360/3045-20/" data-ref-id="3045-20">Xbox 360</a>, <a href="/playstation-3/3045-35/" data-ref-id="3045-35">Playstation 3</a>, and <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC</a> during September 2008.

Market Garden was a very ambitious plan, which was intended to culminate with the Americans cutting a path straight to Berlin before Christmas 1944.</p><p style="">Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway is a first-person shooter, like the rest of the games in the series. Crucially however, it retains the emphasis upon strategic actions. Rushing forward will do little more than kill the player rather players must strategically command their squad mates to provide covering and suppressing fire in order for the player to flank the enemy.</p><p style="">As with previous games in the <a href="/brothers-in-arms/3025-617/" data-ref-id="3025-617">Brothers in Arms</a> franchise, individual soldiers are not incredibly strong and succumb to their wounds after sustaining only a few bullets. For this reason, it is important to move soldiers in a manner where they can exploit weaknesses in enemy defenses. </p><p style="">Characters previously established in the franchise, such as <a href="/joe-red-hartsock/3005-3353/" data-ref-id="3005-3353">Joe Hartsock</a>, reappear, though they are not playable. The game also includes <a href="/full-body-awareness/3015-1692/" data-ref-id="3015-1692">full body awareness</a>, which previous Brothers in Arms titles did not. This is due to the use of third person models, in which the player's view is placed.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">While playing as Baker, players are encouraged to move slowly and think tactically about their methods of approach. Players are allowed to manage small squads of soldiers, each with their own benefits and setbacks. For example, players can control a machine-gun team, who will set up a <a href="/m1919-browning-machine-gun/3055-2693/" data-ref-id="3055-2693">Browning M1919A6</a> and pump hundreds of rounds at the enemy. They are weakened by their long reloads, and general exposure to enemy fire - after all, the idea of a machine gun isn't that you hide - it's that you make an entire enemy squad keep their heads down. When a team is killed in action, they are not gone for good however, and will rejoin the fight at the end of the skirmish. Even so, losing team members is not good, due to the fact that they may be useful to have during combat. It is possible for the player to lose their entire squad, forcing them to advance solo; a tactic which is both suicidal, and virtually impossible to succeed with.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9532/287467-brothers_in_arms_hells_highway_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-287467" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.74418604651163" data-width="430" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 430px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:74.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9532/287467-brothers_in_arms_hells_highway_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-287467"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9532/287467-brothers_in_arms_hells_highway_2.jpg"></a><figcaption>A US soldier carries his Bazooka in a downpour</figcaption></figure><p style="">Hell's Highway is the first game in the Brothers in Arms franchise to include a fully-fledged cover system, as a bonus. Rather than simply crouching behind a wall, it is possible for the character to actually enter cover by leaning against the wall. It is possible to ' <a href="/blind-fire/3015-612/" data-ref-id="3015-612">blindfire</a>' over or around cover, in order to minimise exposure to enemy bullets. Enemies, and friendly soldiers, will also use these tactics, so it is imperative for the player to understand the cover system, and use it their advantage. If a Nazi is hiding behind a barrel, a few bullets will quickly negate any advantage he may have held, as Hell's Highway also includes an environmental damage system. Some cover can have its weaknesses, such as tables. They are wooden, and wood can easily be penetrated by bullets. If the players sets their teams up correctly, then they can kill a hostile using weak cover before he even hits the floor. Similarly, some cover is much stronger than others, such as concrete walls. These cannot be penetrated as easily, and therefore are sometimes useful to hide behind.</p><p style="">Rather uniquely, the game does not depict Baker taking several bullets and continuing to move. Instead, the game suggests that rounds are going to be passing around Baker. As bullets miss Baker, the screen takes on a red scheme, before Baker is killed. Only one or two shots are needed to kill, and the rest of the bullets going past give a similar threat style as other titles (such as Call of Duty) use for injuries. The system is known as the "Threat Indicator", and is intended to give a heightened sense of realism seeing as a single bullet can prove fatal in a battlefield.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/151/1304774-82287179_4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1304774" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/151/1304774-82287179_4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1304774"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/151/1304774-82287179_4.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/151/1304774-82287179_4.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>You also get to drive a tank</figcaption></figure><p style="">Hell's Highway also includes additional missions, outside the character of Matt Baker. Players take on the role of a tank commander, and command an American <a href="/m4-sherman/3055-2726/" data-ref-id="3055-2726">Sherman</a> tank around an area, wiping out the Nazis. These missions are relatively straightforward, though received negative response from fans of the franchise, who felt it deviated too far from the main characters. These missions are few and far between during the campaign however, and are relatively straightforward. Tank sequences are very linear, and make use of another new feature in the game: the 'Action Camera'. This camera adds a more arcade experience to the Brothers in Arms universe, by cutting to a Nazi in slow motion should you score a headshot, or use an explosive. Gore is increased during the camera sequence, and it is not uncommon to see limbs being torn off by explosions.</p><h2>Plot</h2><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/24584/851545-matt_baker.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-851545" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.56317689530686" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/24584/851545-matt_baker.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-851545"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/24584/851545-matt_baker.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/24584/851545-matt_baker.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Matt Baker from a battle</figcaption></figure><p style="">Players take control of <a href="/matt-baker/3005-2364/" data-ref-id="3005-2364">Sergeant Matt Baker</a>, a squad leader that, through months of combat, is starting to ask himself the question "How many lives is one officer worth?" After being deployed as part of Operation Market Garden, the largest Airborne operation ever executed, Baker commands his squad through Holland and is set with many tasks of securing bridges, roads, tanks and 88s with the hope of then being able to move into Germany. The game follows Matt Baker and the 101st Airborne assault on the city of <a href="/eindhoven/3035-2133/" data-ref-id="3035-2133">Eindhoven</a> as well as the many German counterattacks. Along the way, Baker is reminded of the horrors of war as he sees his fellow soldiers as well as innocent civilians be killed by the Germans.</p><p style="">Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway takes a strong look at Matt Baker's relationships with his squad and how he copes with their deaths. Baker often faces hallucinations which contain ghosts of his former soldiers who were killed under his command; we often see him talking to Private.

In <a href="/brothers-in-arms-road-to-hill-30/3030-9137/" data-ref-id="3030-9137">Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30</a> Baker is seen giving the pistol to Sgt. George Risner before D-Day who is then later killed on D-Day. Both Pvt. Larry Allen and Pvt. Michael Garnett get hold on the pistol and are then also killed whilst with Pvt. Leggett. The rest of the squad blamed Leggett for Allen and Garnett's deaths, and on D-Day 7 Leggett was killed while firing at the Germans with the pistol at Hill 30. Baker's squad became suspicious of the pistol as they believe that anyone who holds it will be killed, scenes in Brother In Arms: Hell's Highway often have people reminding and warning Baker of the "curse" on the pistol.</p><p style="">The game closes with Baker standing up in front of his team and speaking about the supposedly cursed pistol. He tells them it's "Just a goddamn gun", but hurls it away regardless. It is unknown if he intends to dispose of this pistol, of if he threw it away in order to regain support from his team.</p><h2>Levels</h2><ul><li>Mission 1: Lost</li><li>Mission 2: Operation Market</li><li>Mission 3: Five-Oh-Sink</li><li>Mission 4: Written In Stone</li><li>Mission 5: Operation Garden</li><li>Mission 6: Baptism Of Fire</li><li>Mission 7: The Rabbit Hole</li><li>Mission 8: Black Friday</li><li>Mission 9: Hells' Highway</li><li>Mission 10: Tooth And Nail</li></ul><h2>Weapons</h2><p style="">Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway includes a variety of weapons employed by both the Nazis and the Allies.

It stars <a href="/yuri-lowell/3005-4202/" data-ref-id="3005-4202">Yuri Lowell</a> as the primary Protagonist. Yuri is an ex-knight of the strong but somewhat oppressive Empire who now spends his life living in the lower quarter of the capital, usually getting on the wrong side of the Knights during his crusade to helping the poor and proving their value is as important as the Nobles.</p><p style="">Along with a substantial cast of characters, the players are immersed once more in a world of magic, elemental spirits, and a cell shaded anime style presentation.</p><h2><b>Story</b></h2><p style="">The people of Terca Lumireis rely on Blastia, which are a form of technology made by inscribing a "Formula" on a blastia "Core". The people use these blastia to carry out different things that go on in their daily life. Cities use the blastia to draw water from the ground or to create fire from a stone. The knights and guilds of the land use blastia to carry out the sole duty to kill monsters that attack citizens. Blastia have been used to create barriers protecting these cities from impending monster attacks; however, they have kept most people from travelling outside the barriers to see distant lands.</p><p style="">In the beginning of the game, the aque blastia that provides water to the people in Yuri's hometown is stolen. He sets out to find it and in the process meets a large cast of characters and gets wrapped up in much larger plots that threaten the existence of all life.</p><h2><b>Characters</b></h2><h3><a href="/yuri-lowell/3005-4202/" data-ref-id="3005-4202"><b>Yuri Lowell</b></a></h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/32111/1285783-yuri.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1285783" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.26900584795322" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:26.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/32111/1285783-yuri.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1285783"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/32111/1285783-yuri.jpg"></a><figcaption>Yuri</figcaption></figure><p style="">The main protagonist of the game, Yuri is a young ex-knight who was born and raised in the lower quarters of Zaphias. Becoming frustrated with government corruption, he becomes a knight with his childhood friend Flynn. Attempting to work his way up the ladder and replace the corrupt officials, it soon dawns on him that his goal is nothing more than a romantic dream. He leaves the knights and returns to his old ways, longing for adventure outside the city's barrier. Upon waking up one day, he discovers that a thief has stolen the lower quarters fountain blastia. In an attempt to recover it, and capture the thief, he embarks on what will become an epic experience.

Strangely, Yuri does not actually wear his scabbard, instead choosing to carry his sword in its sheath in his hand at all times, discarding the scabbard at the beginning of battle. It is unknown why he would deliberately choose to do so.</p><p style="">In addition to Yuri's title skins the player can also use some modifiers to change the way Yuri looks. There are a variety of these modifiers in the game, and some are even unlocked for the entire party (like the canteens after the desert event), however the most common thing to change about Yuri is his hats.</p><h3><a href="/estellise/3005-4208/" data-ref-id="3005-4208"><b>Estillese Sido Heurassein</b></a></h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/32111/1285776-estelle.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1285776" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.26810176125245" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:26.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/32111/1285776-estelle.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1285776"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/32111/1285776-estelle.jpg"></a><figcaption>Estelle</figcaption></figure><p style="">The female lead of <i>Vesperia,</i> Estellise is introduced at the beginning of the game, becoming the players first party member.

Now operating on opposite sides of the law, Flynn and Yuri often must confront each other on their journeys. Although he plays a major role in the story, Flynn is not a playable character, save for one battle in which he aids the group.

Although orphaned, her family origins are never clear. She is at first very anti-social, only caring about her blastia and research, but soon takes a liking to the main cast, Estellise in particular. Rita seems to be one of the only researchers who believes that blastia are alive, and should be treated as such. She uses artes, powered by her blastia circlet, to attack her enemies, along with a ribbon weapon to attack nearby foes.</p><p style="">Most of Rita's visual modifiers are things which can hang off of her back. She can get a series of different colored books or even a large scroll.</p><h3><a href="/karol-capel/3005-4214/" data-ref-id="3005-4214"><b>Karol Capel</b></a></h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/32111/1285779-karol.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1285779" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.27095516569201" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:27.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/32111/1285779-karol.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1285779"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/32111/1285779-karol.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/32111/1285779-karol.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Karol</figcaption></figure><p style="">Karol is a young boy with plentiful knowledge of guilds and his hometown, Dahngrest.

A running joke involves characters, including Raven himself, referring to Raven as an 'old man', despite Raven only being in his 30's. Raven chooses to fight with bows that can be split into daggers for close range combat, and there are a surprising number of stores in the world that carry variations on such a unique weapon.

Patty fights with guns and firearms, though as a pirate, she's equally skilled with knifes and other paraphernalia. Patty is exclusive to the the PlayStation3 version of <i>Tales of Vesperia</i>. She is hinted in the Xbox360 version through a pirate hat with the word "Pa..." found in Capua Torim. As you progress in the game, her story ties in with the original plot. She was likely meant to be in the game from the start, which was further proven when game data indicating her as a playable character was found.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style=""><i>Tales of Vesperia</i> uses an improved version of the <a href="/tales-of-the-abyss/3030-14210/" data-ref-id="3030-14210"><i>Tales of the Abyss</i></a> combat system which is now called the "Evolved Flex-Range Linear Motion Battle System".

Through fighting battles you will gain more LP points and putting them to unlearned skills and when enough of the points are required the skill is unlocked and can use it without having a type of weapon equipped for a certain number of "Skill Points" or SP. SP points are gained by leveling up from experience and a character with a certain skill to that weapon enabling to use that skill (The demo of this game only gives a set number of 20 SP points), Skill Changes are also enabled in the interface for the character enabling to switch up different skills to different enemies, if an enemy has a high knock-back attack a player will enable a skill such as "Quick Recover" so the user is able to jump back up after being knocked down, through using the skill change enough times, you will eventually learn that Arte or spell.</p><p style="">Throughout battles the player can raise a meter which progresses between battles by hitting enemies with basic attacks. This meter can fill itself up to four times. As long as there is one full bar the player can hit the directional pad in any direction to trigger Over Limit. While in Over Limit the character can repeatedly use whatever tech they have set to a hotkey with far less delay. The only limiting factor in Over Limit is that the techs still cost their regular amount of TP when used. This is an easy way to guard break an enemy.</p><p style="">Burst Artes are performed while in overlimit by using an arcane arte or a spell change. Depending on the overlimit level, the amount of time it takes increases allowing you to add more combo's and string together more powerful techniques. A player will also be able to make use of the "Fatal strike" system, being able to kill an enemy in one blow with just one swing of the weapon by a button combination.</p><p style="">Yuri gets a Sorcerer's Ring not too far into the game. This allows him (or whoever is the party leader) to shoot a ball of energy at enemies prior to battle. If hit, the enemy will either become staggered (allowing for an Advantage Encounter) or frozen for a short period of time. Less often, the enemy may become enraged and simply charge the party.</p><h3>Secret Missions</h3><p style="">Throughout the game there are a series of secret missions that can be completed in some of the boss battles throughout the game. These can range from hitting a boss with a specific tech at a certain time, to destroying certain artifacts on the battlefield before beating them. These offer no in game rewards except for achievements on the 360 version. There are no hints of any of these and some of them are practically impossible for a player to simply guess.</p><h2>Animated Movie</h2><p style=""><i>Tales of Vesperia: The First Strike</i>, produced by famed anime stuidio Production I.G., was released in Japan on October 3rd 2009. The movie is set before the events of the game, filling in the details of Yuri's mysterious past as a Knight.

Once installed, the load times decrease, but saving/loading can still sometimes be slow. The dashboard update in August of 2009 lowered this installation to 5.4 GB of hard drive space.</p><h2>PlayStation 3 Version</h2><p style="">The PlayStation 3 version of <i>Tales of Vesperia</i> was released on September 17, 2009 in Japan. Namco Bandai has neither confirmed nor denied that this version would be released outside of Japan. The PS3 version includes a new character, two new available party members (including the new character), and a completely voiced script, whereas the Xbox 360 version of the game voiced over important story elements only rather than things like small talk. The inclusion of these new characters does affect the story to an extent because of the nature of the returning character's involvement in the original story.

Instead, plays and instructions are given to the team as a whole. </p><h2>Madden 09 Bundle</h2><p style="">The game became available a month earlier than its September 2nd, 2008 release date as the full version was included in Madden 09's 20th Anniversary Collectors set along with an extra dvd of video features and documentaries and a version of the old school Madden Genesis. </p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>20837</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/2251189-box_nflhc09.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/2251189-box_nflhc09.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/2251189-box_nflhc09.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/2251189-box_nflhc09.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/2251189-box_nflhc09.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2251189-box_nflhc09.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/2251189-box_nflhc09.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[NFL Head Coach 09]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-6/]]></api_detail_url><id>6</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: E]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2008-09-02 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-88/]]></api_detail_url><id>88</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation Network (PS3)]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-network-ps3/3045-88/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3N]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/nfl-head-coach-09/3030-20837/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[EA Sports NCAA Football 09, NCAA Football 2009, NCAA 09]]></aliases><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20848/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-07-01 16:12:13</date_added><date_last_updated>2015-08-19 08:05:31</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[12th NCAA Football game in the NCAA football series and the 1st to have online dynasty mode and the new breakaway engine.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5469/493956-mattryan_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-493956" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.1574074074074" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:115.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5469/493956-mattryan_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-493956"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5469/493956-mattryan_2.jpg"></a><figcaption>PS3: Matt Ryan </figcaption></figure><p style="">EA continues to improve upon its college football franchise with the silky-smooth NCAA Football '09. Like any annual EA Sports game, this year's edition sports some new gameplay modes, as well as a ton of new in-game mechanics. The engine itself has even improved, as NCAA runs at a constant 60 FPS; the frame rate issues found in previous next-gen Madden and NCAA games have vanished, leaving a smooth, well rounded college football game. This is also the first NCAA Football game with different cover athletes for each console.</p><p style=""><strong>Cover Athletes:</strong></p><p style="">PS3: Matt Ryan QB, Boston College</p><p style="">Xbox 360: Darren McFadden RB, Arkansas</p><p style="">PS2: DeSean Jackson WR, Cal</p><p style="">PSP: Owen Schmitt FB, West Virginia University</p><p style="">Wii: Sparty, Michigan State Mascot</p><h2>Gameplay Modes</h2><h3>Play Now</h3><p style="">Hop into a game right away, pick the teams, and take the field with default settings.</p><h3>Dynasty</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/15/158140/2774622-2731102741-17585.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2774622" data-ratio="1" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/15/158140/2774622-2731102741-17585.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2774622"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/15/158140/2774622-2731102741-17585.jpg"></a><figcaption>PS2: DeSean Jackson</figcaption></figure><p style="">Pick your favorite team and pick up where they left off, beginning in the 2008 offseason. The player makes every decision for the team, from recruiting new players out of high school to naming a team captain. When the season starts, you take the field as your team with the ultimate goal of winning a national championship. The player can make Dynasty mode as in-depth or as non-taxing as he wants: any action (off-season or not) can be simulated to speed up the process.</p><p style=""><strong>Campus Legend</strong></p><p style="">Either pick an existing college player, or create a brand-new high school senior to play as in Campus Legend mode. Take the field as this player, increase your stats and skills, and lead your team to a national championship.</p><h3>Mini-games</h3><p style="">NCAA Football '09 includes some new ideas in its mini-game modes:</p><h3>HORSE</h3><p style="">Just like in basketball, but with field goals! Players can choose from where they kick their field goal, and the amount of wind in the stadium</p><h3>Special Teams Challenge</h3><p style="">Players take turn punting the ball away, each player tries to advance the ball as far as possible on each return. First one to kick a field goal or score a touchdown wins!</p><h3>Tug Of War</h3><p style="">Just like Special Teams Challenge, but with offensive plays instead of punts.</p><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/15/158140/2774623-6477875089-17585.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2774623" data-ratio="1" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/15/158140/2774623-6477875089-17585.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2774623"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/15/158140/2774623-6477875089-17585.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/15/158140/2774623-6477875089-17585.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>PSP: Owen Schmitt</figcaption></figure><p style=""><strong>Bowling</strong></p><p style="">Each frame, take the field as the offense at the opponent's 10 yard-line. You have two tries to get into the endzone, every yard counts as a pin.</p><p style=""><strong>Option Dash</strong></p><p style="">See how many yards and touchdowns you can score in a minute, just by running the option.</p><p style=""><strong>Mascot Mashup</strong></p><p style="">Just like Play Now mode, but instead of players on the field, you play as a team of mascots. The mascots have superior stats, and their jukes and hurdles are replaced by barrel-rolls and somersaults.</p><h2>In-game Mechanics</h2><p style=""><strong>NCAA-Specific Animations</strong></p><p style="">Some this year's player animations won't be seen in Madden '09. A load of tackle, catch, and juke animations were designed specifically for NCAA Football '09 and can't be found anywhere else.</p><p style=""><strong>Composure</strong></p><p style="">If your team is performing poorly, or if the home team crowd is just too loud, your QB may lose his composure. This results in poor throws and 'confusion' when trying to look at your play at the line of scrimmage.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/15/158140/2774624-0087252225-17585.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2774624" data-ratio="1" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/15/158140/2774624-0087252225-17585.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2774624"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/15/158140/2774624-0087252225-17585.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/15/158140/2774624-0087252225-17585.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Xbox 360: Darren McFadden </figcaption></figure><p style=""><strong>QB Quiz</strong></p><p style="">After a poor offensive play (usually an interception) you have the chance to regain your composure by answering the QB Quiz. Three defensive plays are shown; you have to pick the one the opposing defense ran to shut you down. A correct answer will refund composure, a wrong answer will lower your QB's composure even more.</p><p style=""><strong>Ice the Kicker</strong></p><p style="">At the end of a half, if the opposing kicker is lining up to kick a field goal that would tie the game or put his team in the lead, you can call a timeout to ice the kicker. When the kicker retakes the field, he'll have a much more difficult time aiming and kicking the game-changing field goal.</p><h2>Teams</h2><ul><li>Air Force- Overall: 64; Offense: 68; Defense: 69</li><li>Akron- Overall: 72;

Top Spin 3 is no different. Shot selection and placement is more important in this game than the more arcade-like rivals such as <a data-ref-id="3025-208" href="/virtua-tennis/3025-208/" slug="virtua-tennis">                                                                                             Virtua Tennis</a>, which means choosing what to do with the <a data-ref-id="3055-752" href="/tennis-ball/3055-752/" slug="tennis-ball">                                                                                            ball </a>is key to winning a rally. Balls can be hit flat, with top spin, or with slice, while drop and lob shots can also be executed. <br/> <br/>The game features an evolved control scheme, which makes significant modifications to the gameplay compared to previous installments. A hold-and-release system is implemented to allow for greater flexibility; the player must hold down a shot button <i>before </i>the ball reaches them (starting at about the point at which the ball crosses the net), and then release just after the bounce to hit the shot. During the time the button is held, you can manoveur the player into the best position for the shot to maximise power and accuracy. This system puts an added emphasis on anticipation and variety to beat an opponent.<br/> <br/>All of these characteristics make Top Spin 3 an initially tricky title to get into. However, a tutorial mode walks the player through the basic and more complicated concepts of the game.<br/>  <br/><h2>Single-Player</h2> Top Spin 3 includes a variety of game modes:<br/><br/><h3>Exhibition<br/></h3>Exhibition allows two or four players, either all human or a mixture of humans and AI-controlled characters, to play a singles or doubles match with no repercussions.<br/><br/><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/280024-ts3_federer41.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-280024" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.56273764258555" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/280024-ts3_federer41.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-280024"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/56/280024-ts3_federer41.jpg"></a><figcaption> You'll probably have to face Roger Federer at some point</figcaption></figure><h3>World Tour<br/></h3>    The meat of Top Spin 3 is in its World Tour mode, where after <a data-ref-id="3015-217" href="/character-creation/3015-217/" slug="character-creation">                                                                                           creating</a> a new tennis player, you start your career at the bottom as an amateur, slowly working your way up in hope that you will one day be invited to join the professional tour. By becoming the world number one, you will then have an opportunity to become an all-time tennis legend. Winning matches grants <a data-ref-id="3015-39" href="/experience-points/3015-39/" slug="experience-points">                                               XP</a>, which can be used to improve your created player in different departments, and unlock points, which can be spent at the shop to acquire new clothes and gear.<br/><br/><h3>Tournament<br/></h3>The other single-player mode is <a data-ref-id="3015-1096" href="/tournament/3015-1096/" slug="tournament">Tournament</a> mode. Here, the game allows you to compete in a variety of individual tournaments without playing through the World Tour.<br/> <br/><h2>Multiplayer</h2> Multiplayer allows use of your created character from your offline career mode. There are two different modes that can be played online:<br/> <br/> <h3>Player Match </h3> This is a typical exhibition singles or doubles match.<br/><br/> <h3>World Tour</h3>The World Tour mode allows you to enter several tournaments, including Grand Slams and Masters. In a tournament, you are drawn against others who have entered. By winning successive matches, you can progress through and eventually win the event. You can only enter each tournament once, so if you get knocked out or end up as champion, you must wait until the season ends before trying again. Each season in this mode lasts fifteen days.  <br/><br/><h2>Character Creation </h2>Top Spin 3 includes a deep <a data-ref-id="3015-217" href="/character-creation/3015-217/" slug="character-creation">character creator</a>.

When altering the player's face, you can either use preset options or use sliders to have more control over the look.<br/><br/><h2>Roster</h2>  Due to contractual obligations, <a data-ref-id="3005-5524" href="/rafael-nadal/3005-5524/" slug="rafael-nadal">                                                                                         Rafael Nadal</a> is only available exclusively to the PlayStation 3 version of Top Spin 3.

The majority of reviewers discuss the tough learning curve, but conclude that once you get the hang of the game, it becomes very satisfying to play. IGN noted that "deep controls liken Top Spin 3 to the genuine article more than most sports games", calling them "inaccessible" but in time "you'll reap the rewards". Eurogamer calls it a "technical tour-de-force" and the "thinking man's tennis title", but 1UP was less complimentary, saying that it's "prohibitive to folks who don't want to spend hours in the school of hard knocks". <br/> <br/>The Wii and DS iterations garnered mixed reviews. Some critics have commented on how the Wii game lacks the depth and lasting appeal to make it a memorable tennis simulation. Top Spin 3 on the DS has been acknowledged to be a vast improvement on Top Spin 2, as its predecessor suffered from severe frame-rate issues, but opinion is split on whether the core gameplay is fun or not.]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>20857</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/2266555-box_ts3.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/2266555-box_ts3.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/2266555-box_ts3.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/2266555-box_ts3.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/2266555-box_ts3.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2266555-box_ts3.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/2266555-box_ts3.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Top Spin 3]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>10</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-6/]]></api_detail_url><id>6</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: E]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-14/]]></api_detail_url><id>14</id><name><![CDATA[OFLC: G]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-25/]]></api_detail_url><id>25</id><name><![CDATA[CERO: A]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2008-06-23 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-36/]]></api_detail_url><id>36</id><name><![CDATA[Wii]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/wii/3045-36/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[Wii]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-52/]]></api_detail_url><id>52</id><name><![CDATA[Nintendo DS]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-ds/3045-52/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[DS]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/top-spin-3/3030-20857/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[NASCAR 2009, EA Sports NASCAR 09]]></aliases><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20858/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-07-02 12:03:19</date_added><date_last_updated>2012-05-19 22:30:00</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[EA Sports races in with another year of NASCAR Racing with NASCAR 09.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<p style="">NASCAR 09 is the thirteenth NASCAR game published by EA Sports.  All 22 tracks visited by the Sprint Cup series are present in game, as well as an additional two tracks used by the Nationwide and Truck Series.  40 Sprint Cup drivers are playable in the game along with a handful of drivers from the lower tier series.  The game features the Car of Tomorrow for the Cup series, however no manufactures are present in the game.<br/><br/>Jeff Gordon's Involvement in this years edition goes deeper than his appearance on the cover, as he appears in game in the menu screens to assist you through out the game, giving you advice and tutorials on new features.<br/><br/> </p><h2>Reputation and Performance Points</h2>Reputation points will allow you to unlock better racing contracts in the career mode, you earn and lose these points in Sprint Driver Challenges as well as standard races.  Based on performance, the better you do in a race the higher the points you'll earn at the end.  You can only gain reputation points by racing under your driver profile.<br/><br/>Performance points are earned in Sprint Driver Challenges and in the career mode as well.  Performance points can be used to improve your car's stats, you may modify the points rating for your car on four different track styles, Speedway, SuperSpeedway, Short Track and Road Course.  <br/> <ul class="plain-list"> <li>Engine - Controls the amount of Horsepower you have.

Designer Kevin O'Hara announced on November 27, 2008 that the agency will not have a paid subscription fee and that instead, the game will be financed only by product placement advertisements and  premium downloads like "special gear".<br/> <br/> <h2>Plot</h2>   The Agency is a story-led co-operative spy themed shooter set in a persistent, massively multiplayer world. It follows the efforts of rival spy organizations U.N.I.T.E. (United Nations Intelligence and Tactical Experts) and paraGON (Paramillitary Global Operations Network), with either side offering a different take on the espionage world. UNITE represents a well regulated and elite organization that specializes in subterfuge and discretion, where as paraGON are a down and dirty affiliation of mercenaries, who get the job done by whatever means necessary.<br/><br/> <h2>Gameplay</h2><p style=""> As with most MMOs, the visual set of your class or group role will be in your outfit, but unlike those games, changing that role will be as simple as changing that outfit or costume. There's no particular benefit in character specialization, as the developers want the players to experience everything The Agency has to offer by starting just two characters - one UNITE, and one Paragon.</p> <p style=""> The group roles are divided into three set types - combat, stealth, and support - with each of these offering a choice of two provisionally-named roles, although more will be added later through DLC. On the combat side, the tactical specialist is a front-line force who takes and deals damage, and is expert at breaching and creating cover - there are dynamic cover opportunities such as desks to overturn, which both players and AI can make use of. The weapons specialist is similar with a greater variety and depth of skill will weapons.</p> <p style=""> Of the stealth roles, the Spec Ops is a traditional scout who can cloak to sneak ahead, take out security and disarm bombs, with the Spy Ops specialists in manipulation of other players or AI, confusing and turning them. Supporting classes are the self-explanatory field medic, and the field tech, a role that can create perimeter defences with turrets, hack systems, and even lay down custom save checkpoints. Both support classes will be reasonably proficient at combat too, able to do their bit in the fray</p>Each role has its own progression built into the game, with a number of titles available to it for each rank (or overall level) your character gains within its home Agency. There's also a separate weapons experience track that unlocks skills and improvements for the game's various weapon families.<p style=""> Another step away from the MMO tradition, missions are designed to be playable by either solo players or groups - and not by scaling the bad guys' hit points to match, either. Rather, there will be several levels of objectives to a mission, with bronze ratings advancing the story and being simple to solo, silver requiring a high-level skill or several players, and gold a well-organized full party, with better rewards to match. Most missions are intended to last half an hour or so while there may be some that require groups, they won't be part of the main story arc.</p><p style=""><br/></p><h2>Cancellation</h2> It was confirmed on 3/31/2011 that The Agency was officially cancelled. In a press release the cancellation was said to be due to 205 layoffs and the restructuring of Sony Online Entertainment as well as needing to shift their focus to other online MMO's.]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>20900</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/175990-the_agency.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/175990-the_agency.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/175990-the_agency.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4/175990-the_agency.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/4/175990-the_agency.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/175990-the_agency.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/0/4/175990-the_agency.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[The Agency]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating/><original_release_date/><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/the-agency/3030-20900/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20901/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-07-07 14:16:54</date_added><date_last_updated>2014-09-19 15:27:26</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[Sacred 2: Fallen Angel is a prequel to Sacred, taking place 2,000 years before the events in the first game. It has a new graphics engine, which is able to render in 3D but keeps the original game's isometric perspective.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Story</h2><p style="">A mysterious force called T-Energy is the source of all life and magic in Ancaria. It was originally solely under the control of the ancient race of Seraphim. However, over time as they lost interest in the world, they gave some of their control to the High Elves. With this power, the High Elves quickly became the dominant race of Ancaria. A power struggle is raging between two factions within the High Elves. The nobility and clergy are each trying to gain control over the T-Energy. Other races take advantage of the distraction the conflict provides and try to gain control of the T-Energy themselves, so they can become the dominant and most powerful race. As these events unfold, the T-Energy goes increasingly out of control and changes into a destructive force. A force that mutates creatures, destroys cities, and renders entire regions uninhabitable. The campaign selection you make will determine whether your story involves healing the land, or intensifying the chaos.</p><p style="">Versions: Currently out on the PC, PS3, and Xbox 360 as of May 12, 2009.</p><h2>Campaign</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1792/837017-sacred2_2008_12_14_04_04_09_26.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-837017" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.625" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1792/837017-sacred2_2008_12_14_04_04_09_26.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-837017"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1792/837017-sacred2_2008_12_14_04_04_09_26.jpg"></a><figcaption>A piece of the world map (explored areas lit)</figcaption></figure><p style="">The game features a very-large, open-world map with two campaigns, one called "Light" and the other called "Shadow." Throughout the chosen campaign it will crossover with the other, in one example in the Light campaign you are asked to defend a town whilst in Shadow you are asked to attack that same town.</p><p style="">The player can choose whether their character follows the Light or Shadow path, except for Seraphim and Inquisitor. Those two have their paths set and cannot follow the other. Meaning, a Seraphin can only play through the Light campaign while an Inquisitor can only play through the Shadow campaign.</p><h2>Classes</h2><p style="">There are 6 classes in the original Sacred 2, the expansion Fire and Ice adds another extra class:</p><h3><a href="/seraphim/3005-20437/" data-ref-id="3005-20437">Seraphim</a></h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/117587/2322858-sera.png" data-ref-id="1300-2322858" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.0886075949367" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-width="79" style="width: 79px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:108.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/117587/2322858-sera.png" data-ref-id="1300-2322858"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117587/2322858-sera.png"></a></figure><p style="">The Seraphim is an ideal all-around character well suited for beginners and veterans alike. They can use most weapons and wear heavy armor. Their aspects of Exalted Warrior, Celestial Magic and Revered Technology reflect a mix of offensive combat arts and solid protection spells. Efficient buffs like Warding Energy comple the profile of a versatile, strong character class. The Seraphim fights for the light and can only therefore only choose the Light Campagin and may not chose a dark God for her Divine Devotion spell. Her unique mount is a Sabertooth.</p><h3><a href="/shadow-warrior/3005-20436/" data-ref-id="3005-20436">Shadow Warrior</a></h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/117587/2322857-sw.png" data-ref-id="1300-2322857" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.126582278481" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-width="79" style="width: 79px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:112.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/117587/2322857-sw.png" data-ref-id="1300-2322857"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117587/2322857-sw.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117587/2322857-sw.png"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">The Shadow Warrior is a robust, hard to kill and skilled fighter, making him perfect for beginners. He is able to use the largest swords and heaviest war axes and maces. His strikes are deadly and is especially a proficient killer in close quarters. His link to the undead allows him to call on fallen comrades to aid him in battle, including summoning up to four skeleton soldiers to fight along side him. His unique mount is the Hellhound.</p><h3><a href="/high-elf/3005-20492/" data-ref-id="3005-20492">High Elf</a></h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/117587/2322853-he.png" data-ref-id="1300-2322853" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.1428571428571" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-width="77" style="width: 77px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:114.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/117587/2322853-he.png" data-ref-id="1300-2322853"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117587/2322853-he.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117587/2322853-he.png"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Of all the character classes in Sacred 2, the High Elf comes the closest to being a "classic mage" She has three magic-based aspects at her command. Arrant Pyromancer which is especially useful for learning fire spells. Mystic Stormite, which grants her access to a number of ice-based spells, and Delphic Arcania which contains special protection spells such as a teleport spell and a banishing circle. The High Elf's constitution is relatively weak and therefor she is easily wounded by melee attacks. In a fight she is dependent on the use of her combat arts, so playing her requires more strategy than that of a melee class. Her unique mount is the Wind Serpent.</p><h3><a href="/dryad/3005-20440/" data-ref-id="3005-20440">Dryad</a></h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/117587/2322856-dryad.png" data-ref-id="1300-2322856" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.1282051282051" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-width="78" style="width: 78px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:112.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/117587/2322856-dryad.png" data-ref-id="1300-2322856"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117587/2322856-dryad.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117587/2322856-dryad.png"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">While the High Elves work mainly with elemental magic, their enemies, the Dryads, focus on nature. Capricious Hunter, Cabalistic Voodoo, and Nature Weaver are the aspects used by the Dryad. She is also the ranged combat specialist among the character classes and starts off with a blowgun and a better than average dexterity value. No one can beat this character when it comes to bows and blowguns. At the same time, her magic is relatively weak initially and as such, is recommended more for advanced and veteran players. Her unique mount is the Monitor Lizard.</p><h3><a href="/temple-guardian/3005-20439/" data-ref-id="3005-20439">Temple Guardian</a></h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/117587/2322855-tg.png" data-ref-id="1300-2322855" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.1333333333333" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-width="75" style="width: 75px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:113.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/117587/2322855-tg.png" data-ref-id="1300-2322855"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117587/2322855-tg.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117587/2322855-tg.png"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">The Temple Guardian is a special character who can access T-Energy directly. In contrast to the other characters, one of his most important weapons - his weapons arm - is already built in, meaning his left arm changes with whatever combat art is used at the time. He is always able to fire a bolt of energy</p><p style="">for this arm, but as such cannot dual wield, use two-handed weapons, or use a shield. Due to his unique abilities, he makes an excellent support character in co-op play, but is better suited for experienced players in single player campaign. His unique mount is a Mobiculum. He is also the only character that can be only played in the 'good' campaign.</p><h3><a href="/inquisitor/3005-20438/" data-ref-id="3005-20438">Inquisitor</a></h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/117587/2322854-inq.png" data-ref-id="1300-2322854" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.1190476190476" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-width="84" style="width: 84px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:111.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/117587/2322854-inq.png" data-ref-id="1300-2322854"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117587/2322854-inq.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117587/2322854-inq.png"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">The Inquisitor is the complete inverse of a the Seraphim and is to the powers of Darkness what the Seraphim are to the powers of Light. The Inquisitor is a High Priest of the High Elves, although the clergy is in direct conflict with the aristocratic High Elves and want total control of T-Energy. His combat arts are of a dark nature, including Nefarious Netherworld, magic that drains souls from his opponents and turns the dead into weapons. Just like his counterpart - the Seraphim - he is a versatile character as an excellent melee fighter with and extensive command of magic. The Inquisitor, being an ally of the Dark, can only play the Dark Campaign and may call on a much more limited number of the Gods than most other characters. The Inquisitors unique mount is the Shroud Spider.</p><p style="">One extra class has been added in the expansion pack, Blood &amp; Ice:</p><h3>Dragon Mage</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/117587/2322865-sacred2_dragon_mage.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2322865" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.1385199240987" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:113.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/117587/2322865-sacred2_dragon_mage.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2322865"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117587/2322865-sacred2_dragon_mage.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117587/2322865-sacred2_dragon_mage.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">The Dragon Mage is part of a dragon cult from a remote part of the world. The members of the cult are respected by and live together with dragons in a community. Only a chosen few are being granted the honour of being instructed by the dragons for training in the ancient dragon magic. A magic that comes from a dimension beyond this world. This energy can take on the powerful T-Energy, which is the source of all life and all magic in Ancaria.</p><p style="">Only the most powerful who complete this training are capable of assuming the form of a dragon and of using the concentrated power of dragon magic. Only they have the privilige of being allowed to carry the title "Dragon Mage". The unique mount of the Dragon Mage is the Draconicon, a hybrid crossover between a dragon and a horse.</p><h3>Multiplayer</h3><p style="">The game features 16 player on the PC, 4 players through Xbox 360's Live service and the Playstation 3's 4 players via <u>PSN</u>, or 2 offline.

In this alternate reality, steam-power has overtaken combustible fuels as the power source of choice, and steam-powered robots were developed for use on both sides of the war by the evil Prescott, CEO and founder of the evil corporation Prescott Standard Industries. After making enough money selling weapons and steam-powered vehicles to both sides across the American Sovereignty, Prescott has decided instead to create a "New America" with himself as the ruler, crushing anyone who opposes him.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7047/496502-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-496502" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="960" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 960px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7047/496502-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-496502"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/7047/496502-4.jpg"></a><figcaption>Scale the environment to gain high ground</figcaption></figure><p style="">You play as Hamilton Rourke, a tough and gritty ex-Union soldier who apparently quit the army some time after his wife went missing. However, he was dragged out of retirement by Yakecan, a Native American girl and Professor Winslow, an expert on steam technology who have joined the resistance forces against PSI. In the beginning of the game, they try to stall the advance of one platoon of PSI's "New American" forces, hoping that the leader of Terra Verte will back them up. Unfortunately, the only backup that arrives from Terra Verte is the Governor's son, Ramon Zagato, as the Governor himself decided that Terra Verte itself would remain neutral in the war. The resistance forces blow up the bridge, but PSI simply lays down a new one. On top of that, a strange ninja kidnaps the Professor, forcing the resistance to retreat aboard their airship.</p><p style="">They seek help from Yakecan's brother, a shaman named Akahando who shares with Rourke his gift of foresight (which only works if you stand still and you can't use weapons in the game, don't ask) and directs them to a mine where PSI has been collecting the raw materials to make the greenish Serum that PSI has been using to strengthen its own army. Somewhere near that mine, the Professor is being held where two girls named Jack and Selina decide to watch over him. The resistance forces (consisting entirely of Hamilton, Yakecan and Ramon) fight their way through PSI and drive around on steam-powered bikes until they reach the Professor's hiding spot. They also discover that Jack is his daughter and she was dosing herself with Serum.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7047/496499-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-496499" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="960" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 960px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7047/496499-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-496499"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/7047/496499-1.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/7047/496499-1.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Stop the PSI using a combination of weapons and melee combat</figcaption></figure><p style="">After escaping the mine with their airship, Professor Winslow repairs Jack's arm while the resistance plans to stop PSI before they raze Terra Verte into rubble, but Jack escapes and the other girl named Selina fires on the resistance as they try to pursue her. Also, Prescott captures Akahando somehow and demands that he share his power of foresight with him or he will take it. After sabotaging some PSI artillery, Hamilton finds himself fighting against Selina and is saved at the last moment by Jack, but Selina escapes.</p><p style="">Hamilton pursues Selina into a ruined city where he is attack by the mysterious ninja from before, but it turns out the ninja all along was Hamilton's wife Dayden, who had been tortured and injected with Serum. Hamilton reluctantly ends her life when PSI forces march into Terra Verte and conquer the land anyways.</p><p style="">Eventually, the resistance forces manage to trap the PSI troopers by drowning them in seawater using Terra Verte's irrigation system against them, including Selina. Then the resistance decides that the only way to end the fight is to take it to Prescott himself and kill him.</p><h2>Multiplayer</h2><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12337/1799141-damnation_kingofthehill_shaft__4__noscale.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1799141" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="960" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 960px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12337/1799141-damnation_kingofthehill_shaft__4__noscale.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1799141"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/12337/1799141-damnation_kingofthehill_shaft__4__noscale.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/12337/1799141-damnation_kingofthehill_shaft__4__noscale.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>King of the Hill game mode</figcaption></figure><p style="">The game features 4 online multiplayer modes including deathmatch, team deathmatch, king of the hill and capture the flag.

A new feature to <a data-ref-id="3005-967" href="/spyro-the-dragon/3005-967/" slug="spyro-the-dragon">   Spyro</a> is that he is able to fly at anytime in the game instead of just gliding.   The game also features a co-op which lets other players drop in and control <a data-ref-id="3005-3958" href="/cynder/3005-3958/" slug="cynder">  Cynder</a>. This also lets a single player control both Spyro and Cynder and uses them as a “Tag Team”.

While Cynder controls Wind, poison, shadow and fear. The powers were given to her when she was under the control of the Dark Master, Cynder is a bit faster that Spyro but not as powerful. They also have a system called melee combos, which means the more hits in secession a player lays onto a enemy the more blue gems will appear. Blue gems are used to power up Spyro’s and Cynder’s breath moves. Along with the Blue gems there are the Red gems which restore health, Green gems which restore Dragon breath and Purple gems [also called fury gems] that when collected will enable the player to use a extremely powerful attack called “ A Devastating Attack” which kills all enemies and even bosses have a small chance of surviving the attack. <br/><br/></p> <p style=""> Along with their powers, Spyro and Cynder can find and equip Dragon armor which has a number of different attributes.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>20908</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/2136555-box_tlosdotd.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/2136555-box_tlosdotd.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/2136555-box_tlosdotd.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/2136555-box_tlosdotd.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/2136555-box_tlosdotd.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2136555-box_tlosdotd.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/2136555-box_tlosdotd.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[The Legend of Spyro: Dawn of the Dragon]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-29/]]></api_detail_url><id>29</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: E10+]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-6/]]></api_detail_url><id>6</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: E]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[BBFC: PG]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2008-10-28 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-19/]]></api_detail_url><id>19</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 2]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-2/3045-19/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS2]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-36/]]></api_detail_url><id>36</id><name><![CDATA[Wii]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/wii/3045-36/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[Wii]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-52/]]></api_detail_url><id>52</id><name><![CDATA[Nintendo DS]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-ds/3045-52/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[DS]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/the-legend-of-spyro-dawn-of-the-dragon/3030-20908/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20914/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-07-07 16:27:36</date_added><date_last_updated>2014-06-03 05:14:07</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[A World War I first-person shooter that aimed to emphasize the horrors of trench warfare.

For example, if a player was on a hot streak that week, the player's ratings would go up, and the opposite would occur if they were struggling. The updates also accounted for trades in-season, as well as injuries that happened during the season. These rosters were also implemented online, so players couldn't abuse a certain player who was injured during the year.</p><p style="">Along with improved menus and fixes to glitches the previous year, NBA 2K9 featured "Team Up" where up to 10 players could face against each other online at the same time.

Their team captain is defensive end Kimo Talofa and has been their captain since the team has been in the League.</td></tr><tr><td>Arizona</td><td>Outlaws</td><td>1</td><td>The Outlaws are known for their high-octane offense that can score on any play. Their team captain is veteran wide receiver Tito Maas.</td></tr><tr><td>Baltimore</td><td>Bearcats</td><td>3</td><td>The Bearcats are most known for being one of the pushover teams consisting of no passing game and no defense to speak of. The only type of offense is from their team captain Kwazi Mbutabe.</td></tr><tr><td>Carolina</td><td>Copperheads</td><td>2</td><td>Carolina is known for their quarterback and team captain Grant Tanner who's known for having the best long ball in the League.</td></tr><tr><td>Chicago</td><td>Marauders</td><td>2</td><td>Their team is known for their team captain Shane Spain who is the icon to the city of Chicago for breaking multiple passing records and winning MVP awards.</td></tr><tr><td>Cincinnati</td><td>Crusaders</td><td>3</td><td>The Crusaders are known for being a cell dweller and one of the weakest teams in the League. Their current team captain is Ezekiel Freeman.</td></tr><tr><td>Cleveland</td><td>Steamers</td><td>3</td><td>After World War II, It would take over 60 years for Cleveland to get another franchise but they would finally succeed when they lured the bankrupt San Diego Cyclones to relocate there. Now this newest incarnation of the Steamers are back with a great secondary and a good receiving corps that could be molded into a contender.</td></tr><tr><td>Denver</td><td>Grizzlies</td><td>1</td><td>Lead on offense by running back Tyler Neal, the Grizzlies are a team on the rise. They play well on both sides of the ball. Management used up all their money on the starters so depth is an issue, but when the team is healthy it's on of the top in the League.</td></tr><tr><td>Detroit</td><td>Devils</td><td>3</td><td>Over the past 3 seasons the Devil have slipped further and further down the League standings. Detroit has some incredible playmakers on offense, and if their offense line had any talent the passing game would be unstoppable. As for defense - they couldn't stop anyone if there was a 20 ft. wall built on the line of scrimmage.</td></tr><tr><td>Houston</td><td>Riders</td><td>3</td><td>The Houston Riders are an expansion team that joined The League in between Blitz I and II. The Riders have been near the bottom of Division 3 in their two seasons in the league, mostly because they drafted poorly. This year is different however; they've drafted a solid rookie class and Daunell Sullivan appears to be the perfect asset to solidify a powerful running game. These perennial losers have a chance to make some noise this year.</td></tr><tr><td>Kansas City</td><td>Crossfire</td><td>2</td><td>Kansas City have been trying to reshape its image on and off the field.Once known as a felonious bunch of cheap shot artists, they are now one of the cleaner teams. With on of the fastest teams in the League, the Crossfire blitz the QB like it's going out of style.</td></tr><tr><td>Las Vegas</td><td>Aces</td><td>2</td><td>The Aces play in a high-risk and high-reward style of play on both sides of the ball and it's effective, not just on the football field. but putting people in the stands as well.</td></tr><tr><td>Los Angeles</td><td>Riot</td><td>2</td><td>The Riot are an excellent team on paper, but their main weakness is a lack of team spirit and unity. The owner believes that signing groups of individual stars will bring about a championship, but ended up bringing in a bunch of ball hogs only looking out for themselves.</td></tr><tr><td>Mexico City</td><td>Aztecs</td><td>1</td><td>Looking to expand beyond the USA, The League (backed by the Mexican government) was able to convince the owners of the Dallas Aztecs to relocate their team to Mexico City. Already having a large hispanic fan base the owners decided the move could only help the franchise although it came with a steep learning curve.</td></tr><tr><td>Miami</td><td>Hammerheads</td><td>2</td><td>Miami is a franchise that suffered upheaval, moving from their aging Orlando stadium to a new modern venue in Miami, only to see it recently ravaged by a string of hurricanes. In spite of this the team persevered, with an exciting spread offense that has no trouble moving the ball and putting points on the scoreboard. This is no doubt due to their new Team Captain former Dallas Aztecs QB and two-time League MVP Julius Williams.</td></tr><tr><td>Milwaukee</td><td>Hounds</td><td>3</td><td>The Milwaukee Hounds are a professional football team in The League. They currently play in Division 3 and are the second League team to play in Milwaukee after the Milwaukee Bottlers called the city home from 1923 to 1941.</td></tr><tr><td>New York</td><td>Nightmare</td><td>1</td><td>The New York Nightmare are a team based on New York City, USA. They are among the elite teams in The League. The Nightmare are the succesors to the New York Shamrocks</td></tr><tr><td>Minnesota</td><td>Reapers</td><td>2</td><td>The Reapers are a team that are as conservative as they come. They have a bland pound-it out running game, and a defense as strong as the French Army. However when the pressure is on and Tony Forbes is at his best, Minnesota is a contender.</td></tr><tr><td>New England</td><td>Regulars</td><td>1</td><td>The Regulars shrugged off allegations of cheating to win the 2007 League Championship and look ready to defend their title. Cornerback Packrat Jones took over the defense from retired captain Vonnie Treonday and kept up the level of excellence on the field. Though the defense is revered, the offense is as solid and strong as any in the League.</td></tr><tr><td>Philadelphia</td><td>Brawlers</td><td>3</td><td>The Brawlers live up to their names with their style of play. They play as dirty as they can get, and get away with far more than they should. However, cheap shots can only get you so far. The Brawlers are held back by an abysmal offense even for Division III standards, but this defense can play with the best of them.</td></tr><tr><td>Seattle</td><td>Reign</td><td>1</td><td>Two seasons ago the Reign won the League Championship with their swarming defense led by Chad Longstreet, but they have not been back since. This season the defense is as aggressive as ever, but the talent on the secondary isn't as good as past years.</td></tr><tr><td>Vancouver</td><td>Beavers</td><td>1</td><td>Vancouver came into the League two years ago and they've been on fire since, battling their way into Division I last year. They did that by making the most of their expansion drafts, which they used to stockpile young, underrated talent. They've got a few holes on their defense, but their offense is arguably the best in the League.</td></tr><tr><td>Washington</td><td>Redhawks</td><td>2</td><td>In the past few seasons, Redhawks have evolved into a defensive team to one that is balanced on both sides of the ball. Washington still can't play their way into Division 1 and most pin the blame on the team's disastrous leadership, which have seen the last to team captains end up in federal prison.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>The Captains</h2><p style="">Each team has a team captain that some-what acts as a boss during the games.

A <a href="/wii-u/3045-139/" data-ref-id="3045-139">Wii U</a> version was also in the works but was eventually cancelled on April 5th, 2013.</p><p style="">The game features an original story by Bradley Thompson and David Weddle of Battlestar Galactica fame which is playable as either a single-player campaign, a two-player split screen co-op or with up to four players online. Although players take upon the role of humans in the story mode the competitive online multiplayer modes allow players to take upon control of both the human marines and as various members of the <a href="/xenomorph/3015-4530/" data-ref-id="3015-4530">Xenomorph</a> species.</p><h2>Setting &amp; Place in Alien Franchise</h2><p style="">The games story occurs approximately 17 weeks after the the events of the second film in the <a href="/alien/3025-25/" data-ref-id="3025-25">Alien</a> movie franchise (Aliens) and was announced as being official canon to the Alien franchise and universe at <a href="/pax-east-2012/3015-7159/" data-ref-id="3015-7159">PAX East 2012</a>. With the assistance of 20th Century Fox, Gearbox Software's intentions was to create the true spiritual successor to Aliens that fans of the film have been waiting for and were invited to speak with Ridley Scott (the director of the original Alien movie) and view his script and plans for Alien prequel Prometheus while the film was still undergoing development.</p><p style="">Randy Pitchford of Gearbox Software was given pretty free reins with the story and even got to add in his own tidbits to the Alien universe such as the Crusher, an enormous Xenomorph with a bulletproof head crest named after the way it kills its opponents.</p><p style="">Gearbox Software hailed Aliens: Colonial Marines as the true spiritual sequel to James Cameron's sci-fi film Aliens prior to the games release and claimed that it would tie up some of the plot-holes and loose ends of Alien 3, improving the overall integrity of the lore.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p style="">The game's story takes place approximately 17 weeks after the events of Aliens after the disappearance of the USS Sulaco and it is crew, when a search and rescue team is sent out to Acheron (LV-426) to investigate and learn the whereabouts of Ellen Ripley, Carter Burke and the rest of the crew in response to a distress call sent out by Cpl. Dwayne Hicks at the end of the Aliens movie.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1547003-lv_426.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1547003" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.80191693290735" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1547003-lv_426.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1547003"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1547003-lv_426.jpg"></a><figcaption>LV-426 is one inhospitable planet</figcaption></figure><p style="">What they find upon arrival is the same deadly creature the original crew found in Aliens as a massive Xenomorph infestation have overrun the ship and the craft itself is back in orbit over LV-426 and not planet Fury-161 as intended.</p><p style="">The game's story is told through the eyes of Corporal <a href="/christopher-winters/3040-35291/" data-ref-id="3040-35291">Christopher Winter</a> who along with his four-man search and rescue team of the USS Sephora discover that Weyland-Yutani PMCs have taken command of the USS Sulaco and were breeding Xenomorphs for study on board the ship.</p><p style="">When the hostile mercenaries attack the squad of the USS Sephora they destroy both ships and Winter's and his squad are forced to escape aboard a dropship to the planet LV-426 below and take refugee in the now ruins of Hadley's Hope colony complex. The squad's captain, Captain Jeremy Cruz, gives the orders for all other surviving marines to make their way to the colony complex in an attempt to survive and hold out until a rescue arrives.</p><p style="">With their position secure Captain Cruz then orders Winters and his squad to venture to a nearby Weyland-Yutani research facility to recover a manifest that documents the capture an unknown prisoner by Weyland-Yutani. On route to the facility however one of Winter's squad-mates, Private Bella Clarison, becomes impregnated with an infant Chestburster and so in an attempt to save her Winters accompanied by Private O'Neal help escort Bella to the research facility in an attempt to force any surviving research scientists and personnel to remove the embryo and save Bella's life.</p><p style="">Upon arrival at the facility Winters and his squad interrogate a surviving Weyland physician who reveals that there is no possible way to save Bella's life because even if the embryo is removed, the creature's invasive placenta is cancerous and will ultimately kill her anyway. And so with the news that there is no chance of survival Bella dies while saying farewell to Winters and O'Neal when the Chestburster inside her hatches and violently kills her.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="medium" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/34856/2439270-2013-02-14_00009.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2439270" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/34856/2439270-2013-02-14_00009.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2439270"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/34856/2439270-2013-02-14_00009.jpg"></a></figure><p style="">Having failed to save Bella's life Winters and O'Neal recover the manifest they were sent to locate and rescue the prisoner, revealed to be Corporal Higgs, who explains how Weyland-Yutani forces intercepted the USS Sulaco and how a fire in the hypersleep bay caused Ripley, Newt, Lance Bishop and an unidentified man to be evacuated from the ship in an EEV. Higgs meanwhile was held captive by Weyland-Yutani and tortured by Michael Weyland in an attempt to learn more of the Xenomorph's origins and to gain control of the weapons system of the Sulaco. Finally Higgs reveals that an FTL-capable ship is docked at the research facility and with it the stranded marines last chance of escape.</p><p style="">With news of the docked ship Captain Cruz orders all surviving personnel, led by Winters and Higgs, to launch an all out attack on the research facility in hope of capturing the vessel. The assault ultimately is successful although moments before Winters, Cruz and Higgs can board the ship leaves but in one last desperate attempt Cruz manages to pilot a dropship into the hanger of the FTL vessel. But just when Winters and his crew think that it's all over the Queen Xenomorph, who has managed to cling to the leaving vessel, appears and confronts the squad and as his final heroic act Captain Cruz sacrifices himself to save the rest of his men and kill the Queen once and for all.</p><p style="">Winter and the remaining members of his squad along with Higgs then set about finding and confronting Michael Weyland to bring the Weyland-Yutani Corporation down once and for all. Shortly after locating Weyland however Hicks deduces that he is merely an android double left behind as a decoy and executes him. In search of any remaining useful intelligence, Bishop connects to the destroyed android's CPU and states that he has "everything", setting the stage for further confrontation between the Colonial Marines and the Weyland-Yutani Corporation.</p><p style=""> </p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Single-Player / Co-op</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2021133-acm1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2021133" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2021133-acm1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2021133"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/135472/2021133-acm1.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/135472/2021133-acm1.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">As a marine, for the games single-player and co-op modes, the gameplay is that of a standard action first-person shooter. The game features various collectibles also which are scattered throughout each of the 11 mission within the campaign. These include audio logs, dog tags and iconic weaponry from the franchise which players may arm themselves with once said weapon is found.</p><p style="">The game also features an experience system in which players earn XP for finishing missions, killing enemies, finding collectibles or completing various challenges. The experience system carries across to the multiplayer mode also and as players level up and complete challenges they earn the ability to either upgrade or customise weaponry, alter their appearance or unlock traits and skills for both the Marines and Alien classes in the multiplayer modes.</p><p style=""><b>Colonial Marines</b></p><p style="">As a marine, players have access to a wide arsenal of weaponry to deal with the opposing forces including machine guns, shotguns, pistols as well as the series renown flamethower and <a href="/m56-smart-gun/3055-4518/" data-ref-id="3055-4518">Smart gun</a>. Marines also come equipped with motion trackers which allow players to detect unseen enemies although equipping the tracker does force players to lower their weapon thus leaving them open to an attack.</p><p style=""><b>Xenomorphs</b></p><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/16/164828/2345446-27394acm_nycc_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2345446" data-ratio="0.55136268343816" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:55.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/16/164828/2345446-27394acm_nycc_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2345446"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/16/164828/2345446-27394acm_nycc_2.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/16/164828/2345446-27394acm_nycc_2.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">During the multiplayer aspect of the game players also take control of the Xenomorphs (the camera shifting to the third-person) and may select from several classes (or “breeds”) of the species each with their own skills and abilities although their primary method of attack is close quarters melee combat. The aliens also have the ability to see their targets through objects and walls using their pheromone sonar system and travel at much faster speeds than their human prey but to compensate for their additional powers they are much weaker and have a lower overall health.</p><h3>Multiplayer</h3><p style="">Aside from the drop-in / drop-out online play for the campaign, the game also features a Versus Mode consisting of 4 game types in players fight off in an Aliens vs Marines battle. The matches all take place over 2 rounds, one in which you control the Marines and one in which you control the Aliens, with the winner being decided by the total tally of the 2 rounds. The 4 available game modes to choose from are:</p><ul><li><strong>Team Deathmatch</strong> - Standard multiplayer affair of two opposing teams with most kills wins.</li><li><strong>Extermination</strong> - Most comparable to King of the Hill as the Marines attempt to capture various points around the map to destroy Xenomorph egg clusters while the aliens must prevent the Marines from doing so.</li><li><strong>Survival</strong> - The Marine team is tasked with surviving the Xenomorph attacks until the countdown comes to an end. Marines are granted one life and a finite amount of ammunition and armor although additional supplies or even XP bonuses may be earned by completing “Survival Ops” challenges.</li><li><strong>Escape</strong> - The Marine's goal is to escape the Xenomorph infested area in the fastest time possible. On their way to the exit the Marines must perform small objectives to open up the next section of the map and the winning team is that which either gained the most progress as the Marines or escaped the stage in the shortest period of time.</li></ul><p style="">During the Survival and Escape modes players are granted one life and so the marines overall toughness is ramped up and rather than instantly die players go into an incapacitated state before death where a window of opportunity exists for them to be revived by a comrade. In the down but not out state players are given a pistol to defend themselves but remain open to attack from any alien threats.</p><p style=""> </p><h2>Xenomorph Species Types</h2><p style="">The following are the different types of Xeno species which are featured in the game. The Soldier, Spitter and Lurker are the three base classes for multiplayer, although the Boiler and Crusher are also playable but must be awoken during the match by players:</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Name</th><th scope="col">Description</th><th scope="col">Mugshot</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Soldier</strong></td><td>Soldiers are the most common variant of Xenomorph and act as the infantry unit of the species.

Their weakness however is their lack of armour and strength in comparison to say the soldier which is why they are primarily suited to combat from a distance rather than at close quarters.</td><td><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/23/234975/2692477-6215505954-Spitt.PNG" data-ref-id="1300-2692477" data-ratio="0.54769230769231" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:54.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/23/234975/2692477-6215505954-Spitt.PNG" data-ref-id="1300-2692477"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/23/234975/2692477-6215505954-Spitt.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/23/234975/2692477-6215505954-Spitt.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style=""> </p></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Lurker</strong></td><td>Lurkers are both silent and fast.

Justice's goal was to get a hold of the Number One head band that was worn upon Afro's fathers brow. Once Justice obtained the Number One head band, he threw away the Number Two head band he previously wore. In the world of Afro Samurai, who ever wears the Number One head band is considered the strongest warrior in the world, with powers rivaling that of God, and</p><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4086/266341-10.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-266341" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4086/266341-10.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-266341"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4086/266341-10.jpg"></a><figcaption>Afro looking pissed!</figcaption></figure><p style="">the only person who can challenge the Number One, is the Number Two. The problem with being number two however is that anyone in the world can challenge you in order to get your head band. Afro takes the Number Two band thrown away by Justice and vows to get revenge for the death of his father.</p><p style="">The game follows the story of the anime, but the developers got permission from Okazaki (who has compared the Afro Samurai universe to that of Western comic book heroes; key elements remain the same but the details vary by story and medium) to come up with new canon in order to fill a ny of the holes left by the anime. New battles, scenarios, and characters were envisioned, and <a data-ref-id="3040-89768" href="/samuel-l-jackson/3040-89768/" slug="samuel-l-jackson">Samuel L. Jackson</a>, and all other main cast members have returned to give their voice talents to the game. The game uses an <a data-ref-id="3015-173" href="/cel-shading/3015-173/" slug="cel-shading">cel-shaded</a> look that allows it to resemble the anime very closely even rendered in the third dimension.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11423/783375-afro003.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-783375" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11423/783375-afro003.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-783375"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11423/783375-afro003.jpeg"></a><figcaption>You have the ability to freeze time.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Afro Samurai is a <a data-ref-id="3015-464" href="/third-person-perspective/3015-464/" slug="third-person-perspective">third person</a> action adventure game that gives you control of Afro as you <a data-ref-id="3015-469" href="/hack-and-slash/3015-469/" slug="hack-and-slash">hack and slash</a> your way through hordes of enemies in a number of beautifully poetic, and violent ways. Afro Samurai uses a dynamic <a data-ref-id="3015-725" href="/death/3015-725/" slug="death">death</a> system where no death animation is scripted, instead the player can cut enemies in any number of ways, and the body parts of the enemies will detach in <a data-ref-id="3015-2332" href="/real-time-combat/3015-2332/" slug="real-time-combat">real time</a>. So you can cut off a variety of things, from the standard head and arms, to the more intricate hands, nails and toes. You can enter focus mode while playing, when you do this the screen goes <a data-ref-id="3015-2863" href="/black-and-white/3015-2863/" slug="black-and-white">black and white</a>, and you can aim at where you wanna slice your foe. You can also use a ton of combos as well, using the X button for a light attack and Y for a heavy attack.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p style="">While RZA is credited as the music director, he was unable to fully contribute due to time constraints. Instead, he instructed the team on how he had went about scoring Afro Samurai and put them in contact with individuals able to assist them in delivering a sound similar to Anime. However, he did contribute a couple of tracks for use in the game.</p><table class="t-editor with-border full-width"><thead><tr><th>Song</th><th>Credits</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Kimono Dance</td><td>Bridgeside productions / Vocals: Cole Rodgers</td></tr><tr><td>Fade to Black</td><td>Bridgeside productions / Vocals: Cole Rodgers</td></tr><tr><td>Afro Fight Groove 1</td><td>Yo-eleven Productions</td></tr><tr><td>Nothing Personal</td><td>Bridgeside productions / Vocals: Keonte Jasper</td></tr><tr><td>Afro Fight Groove 2</td><td>Yo-eleven Productions</td></tr><tr><td>Blood Shed</td><td>Bridgeside productions / Vocals: Cole Rodgers</td></tr><tr><td>Fade to Black</td><td>FouchéMuzik Remix</td></tr><tr><td>Afro Fight Groove 3</td><td>Yo-eleven Productions</td></tr><tr><td>One Try</td><td>FouchéMuzik / Vocals: J.

Quiz TV marks the debut of Sony's party-quiz series, Buzz!, to the PlayStation 3; adding the ability for players to compete online as well as write their own questions and exchange quiz packs online.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2>     Buzz! Quiz TV is the first installment of the popular Buzz! franchise  on the PlayStation 3 .  It is developed by Relentless Software Ltd. and published by Sony Computer Entertainment.  Buzz! Quiz TV is primarily based on television quiz shows; setting its quiz show in front of a live studio audience and structuring each section into rounds.  It features various game modes including "MyBuzz," "Sofa vs. Sofa", and online multiplayer with up to 8 players.  One of the biggest new features added to the series, the seventh game in the Buzz! franchise, is the ability for players to create their own quizzes and questions.  Players can create their own quizzes which can be used in both offline and online multiplayer game modes.  Players can also choose to upload their created quizzes to the entire Buzz! community or only share with their friends.  Buzz! Quiz TV is one of the first games to include the Trophy System feature at launch, which was added to the PlayStation 3 features list in the 2.40 firmware update. The game also has PlayStation Eye and EyeToy support, and <em></em>will take photos while you play the game, which are then placed in albums for you to view later. <br/><br/><h2>Buzz! Channels <br/></h2>     Buzz! Quiz TV gives players a choice of general categories in which questions will be asked.  These Channels can be viewed from the Play Buzz menu prior to starting a game.  From this menu, players can choose to have questions asked from all Channels or the player can select a single Channel from which questions will be derived.  The Channels also include more specific subcategories which players will have to choose from within the quiz game.   <br/> <br/>These Channels include:<br/><br/><h3>Music</h3>     Oldies Music<br/>     80's Music<br/>     90's Music<br/>     Recent Music<br/><br/><h3>Movies &amp; TV</h3>     Movie Buff<br/>     Blockbusters<br/>     TV Hits<br/>     Toons<br/><br/><h3>Brainiac</h3>     Around The World<br/>     People And Events<br/>     Natural World<br/>     Science And Technology<br/><br/><h3>Sports</h3>     Sporting Personalities<br/>     Sporting Achievements<br/>     World Of Sports<br/>     Extreme Sports<br/><br/><h3>Lifestyle</h3>     Style<br/>     Gadgets And Gizmos<br/>     Food And Drink<br/>     Mind And Body<br/><br/><h3>MyBuzz!</h3>     User-generated quizzes submitted to the MyBuzz official website<br/><br/><h2>Key Features<br/></h2><h3>My Buzz</h3>     One of the Key features of Buzz! Quiz TV is the ability for players to create their own quizzes by going to the official <a href="http://www.mybuzzquiz.com/en_US/actions/Home.do" rel="nofollow">  MyBuzz</a> website.  By going to the website and signing in with your PSN ID, players can create their own quizzes or even play other user-submitted quizzes and rate them.  Most importantly, players can also play these quizzes and rate them on the PS3 with the disc-based game but unfortunately you cannot create the quizzes with the disc-based game.<br/><br/><h3>Sofa vs. Sofa</h3>     Buzz! Quiz TV is the first game in the series to allow online play.  By entering the online mode in the "Play Buzz" menu, Buzz! players from all over the world can go head-to-head and compete in a mutliplayer game.  This mode supports up to 4 players.<br/><br/> <h2>Downloadable Content</h2><div> <ul class="plain-list"><li>  National Geographic: Safari Question Pack ($7.99), 9/25/08</li> <li>Videogames Question Pack ($5.99), 9/25/08</li> <li>Sci-Fi Movies Question Pack ($5.99), 9/25/08</li> <li>Horror Question Pack ($5.99), </li> <li>Comedy Question Pack ($5.99), 11/6/08</li> <br/></ul><h2>Character Parody<br/></h2> <b>Aorta </b>is a vampiric character based on the Bride of Dracula and the Bride of Frankenstein, borrowing her hairstyle from the latter.<b> </b>The aorta is the largest and most important artery in the body, playing on the blood theme.<br/> <b><br/>Ash</b> is based on British rock singers, most likely Liam Gallagher, Richard Ashcroft and Ian Brown.<br/><br/><b>Cheery</b> is a generic cheerleader character.<br/><b><br/>Claude </b>is<b> </b>a parody of Marcel Marceau<b>, </b>the famous mime artist<b>. </b>However, the Kenny Everett parody 'Maurice Minor' may be a greater influence.<b><br/></b><b><br/>Donna</b> is based on Madonna and one of her taunts is a move from Vogue.<br/><br/><b>Dwayne</b> is a stereotypical 1950s geek like George McFly or Bernard from the Maniac Mansion series.<br/><br/><b>El Hefe</b> is a Mexican luchador wrestler.

In the game you participate in illegal street racing in a recreated version of Los Angeles in order build up a racing reputation and earn money, which you can then use to buy new vehicles or "pimp out" your existing ones using the game's extremely deep customization system. It runs on the RAGE engine, the same engine that powers <a data-ref-id="3030-16770" href="/rockstar-games-presents-table-tennis/3030-16770/" slug="rockstar-games-presents-table-tennis">Rockstar Games presents Table Tennis</a> and <a data-ref-id="3030-20457" href="/grand-theft-auto-iv/3030-20457/" slug="grand-theft-auto-iv">Grand Theft Auto IV</a>.</p><p style="">The special abilities featured in Midnight Club 3 are back. These features include EMP (short-cut nearby cars), Aggro (makes traffic bump off you), Roar (sends a sonic wave that pushes vehicles away), and Zone (slow-mo driving for better handling).</p><h2>World</h2><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/239/529592-002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-529592" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/239/529592-002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-529592"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/239/529592-002.jpg"></a><figcaption>The gameworld is littered with recognizable landmarks</figcaption></figure><p style="">While it will feature many recognizable landmarks, MC:LA's version of Los Angeles will not be an exact replica of the real city. Instead, Rockstar San Diego is taking the most interesting parts of the city and putting them together to make a compressed version of Los Angeles specially designed for street racing. This does not mean the world will be small, however. It has been said that the drivable area in the game will be bigger than all three cities in <a data-ref-id="3030-5875" href="/midnight-club-3-dub-edition/3030-5875/" slug="midnight-club-3-dub-edition">Midnight Club 3: Dub Edition</a> combined. The entire city will be open from the start. Traffic in the game will also change based on where you are and what time of day it is. Traffic will obviously be much higher during rush hour than it would be at midnight. Other new additions to the game world include a 24-hour day/night cycle a dynamic weather system. Weather will have effects like reducing your vison and making the streets slicker, which means corners are easier to slide around but its much easier to lose tire traction. A map at the bottom left at the screen will display your immediate surroundings and can be enlarged to either a full-screen illustrated or 3D-rendered satellite version.</p><h2>Multiplayer</h2><p style="">Midnight Club: Los Angeles has an online multiplayer component that supports up to 16 players. The game does not feature any split-screen play. When players select Online from the main menu they can either choose to join an existing match or host one of their own. Players can participate in either player or ranked matches. Player matches allow you to customize game modes and rules, while ranked matches have a default setup that cannot be changed. When players join a match lobby, they can choose their car and signal that they are ready to begin the game. After the game ends, the players are brought back to the lobby where the host can change game modes and settings and start another game.</p><h3>Race Types</h3><ul><li><b>Ordered Races:</b> Races where players must drive through multiple checkpoints in a certain order. The first racer to reach the final checkpoint wins.</li><li><b>Circuit Races:</b> Similar to ordered races, the difference being that players must complete several laps around a track before reaching the final checkpoint. There is a Last-Man-Out variation of this race type, in which the last place car at the end of every lap is eliminated.</li><li><b>Unordered Races:</b> Multi-checkpoint races where players can collect all the checkpoints in any order before proceeding to the final checkpoint.</li><li><b>Landmark Races:</b> Races with only one checkpoint. Whoever reaches said checkpoint first wins.</li></ul><h3>Battle Types</h3><ul><li><b>Free-for-all CTF:</b> Players must capture a flag on the map and return it to a certain drop-off point on the map while other racers try to steal the flag for themselves. Whoever reaches the score limit first or has the highest score when the time runs out wins.</li><li><b>Basewar CTF:</b> A team-based version of capture the flag. Each team has a flag that spawns inside their base. It is the each team's job to steal the opposing team's flag and bring it back to their base.</li><li><b>Splitbase CTF:</b> Another team-based capture the flag mode, in which each team has a base and one neutral flag spawns in between the bases. It is each team's job to take that flag and return it to their own base.</li><li><b>Stockpile:</b> A cluster of flags spawn across the city. Players must capture as many flags as they can and take them to a stockpile point. When all the flags have been captured a new cluster of flags spawns. Be careful, however, because one flag in each cluster may be a bomb. You do not know which flag is the bomb until you pick it up. If you do accidentally pick up the bomb, you must transfer it to another player by bumping it into their car before the time runs out. Whoever has the bomb flag when the time runs out will have their score docked. Whoever reaches the score limit or has the highest score when the time runs out wins.</li><li><b>Splitbase Stockpile:</b> A team-based stockpile mode, where a cluster of flags spawns between each team's base. It is each team's job to collect as many flags as they can and return them to their base.</li><li><b>Keepaway:</b> A mode in which one flag spawns at a random place on the map. Whoever captures the flag will accumulate points the longer they hold the flag. They must dodge and evade other players to keep them from stealing the flag. Whoever reaches the score limit or has the highest score when the time runs out wins.</li></ul><h3>Online Cruise</h3><p style="">A mode where players can freely cruise around the entire city. If a player wants to play a game they make one up and request it. If there is more than one race requested it will be added to a queue. If players wish to join the race they can accept the request, or they can choose to ignore it and keep cruising around the city at their leisure.</p><h3>Race Editor</h3><p style="">The game features a race editor which can be accessed from online cruise mode. Players can make their own races by setting down checkpoints whereever they want to.

This game was released on October 14, 2008.  Beast Rider is a reinvention of the <a data-ref-id="3025-251" href="/golden-axe/3025-251/" slug="golden-axe"> Golden Axe</a> series which made its home console debut on the <a data-ref-id="3045-6" href="/genesis/3045-6/" slug="genesis"> Sega Genesis</a>. Unlike the original game which featured co-op play throughout, Beast Rider is a single-player game in which the player assumes the role of <a data-ref-id="3005-7322" href="/tyris-flare/3005-7322/" slug="tyris-flare"> Tyris Flare</a>, the amazon warrior of the original game.<br/> <br/><br/><h2>Plot</h2>The game's story is a retelling of the original game's conflict against the forces of <a data-ref-id="3005-13589" href="/death-adder/3005-13589/" slug="death-adder"> Death Adder</a>.  Early on in the game, Tyris' tribe is destroyed by Death Adder's army, leaving her as the last among her kind.  She meets up with the dwarf warrior <a data-ref-id="3005-1990" href="/gilius-thunderhead/3005-1990/" slug="gilius-thunderhead"> Gilius Thunderhead</a>, who presents her with pieces of the fabled Golden Axe, and is charged with the task of restoring the weapon to its full strength. <br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2>The gameplay is split into three parts: combat, magic, and beast riding. The battle system features swordplay similar to that found in other third-person action games, with the focus on fighting large groups of enemies, while a parry and evade system should add some depth. As well as featuring bloody combat and dismemberment , stringing together long combos allow players to initiate brutal cinematic kills.<br/><br/>To pilot a beast, Tyris must climb onto the creature and drive her sword into the creature's back as a makeshift method of control.

Baja combines real world racing with arcade style fun to challenge gamers to realistic, unforgiving terrain. Baja will also offer 1000 miles of steep mountains, thick mud and deept canyons in nine various worlds, from Baja, Mexico to Nevada.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">As the retail box says, the game's "revolutionary vehicle physics deliver unprecedented life-like handling, and a support management system allows gamers to monitor and repair realistic vehicle damage as fenders fly, tires are blown, suspension is stressed and engines overheat." Baja supports four-player split screen multiplayer capability, 10-player online and LAN as well as multiple-screen panoramic view.</p><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9734/516287-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-516287" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9734/516287-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-516287"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9734/516287-3.jpg"></a><figcaption>Prepare for landing!</figcaption></figure><p style="">Baja: Edge of Control features several different race events, with the most familiar one being a standard circuit race. These circuit races will be on courses spread over several miles, and will last around ten minutes. Baja rally races are much different then rally events you'd see in the WRC rallies, because the rallies in Baja include altercations with traffic and wheel-to-wheel affairs. The races will still be point-to-point, but you'll only have to beat the select cars in the same racing class as you.</p><p style="">Time trial events are also available if you like to race alone or if you need practice without worrying about opponents on your tail. Hill climbs are very similar to Time Trials. They are point-to-point races up and down mountains, in purpose built monster cars. Open Class races in Baja are similar to drag races since the slower car classes start racing first. The faster cars that take off last will have to pass the slower cars and be the first to finish in order to win, since there are no class specific races like in most events in the game. The most noticeable race mode in Baja is endurance racing. These races are pseudo-real time, not like the 24 minute Le Mans races in GRID that use a fast day/night cycle to resemble 24 hours. These races will take hours to complete, and include the famed Baja 1000.</p><p style="">Licensed vehicles in Baja: Edge of Control include VW Beetles, H3 Hummer, Toyota Tocoma, Ford Ranger, F-Series Fords including the F-100; and more! Racing classes include Unlimited VW, 4X4, Mini Trucks, Open Wheel, Class 1, and Trophy Vehicles. With all of these classes combined, there re over 160 vehicles in Baja.</p><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2352/303894-baja_002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-303894" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75173611111111" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2352/303894-baja_002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-303894"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2352/303894-baja_002.jpg"></a><figcaption>Eat my dust!</figcaption></figure><p style="">The career mode is fairly standard compared to most racing games. It will include gold, silver, and bronze medals, awarded to the top three finishers in a race. The career mode also includes a completion percentage meter and unlockable cars as you progress through various events. An experience meter also controls which items you can unlock as you progress as a Baja race.Rather than races being separated into event types in Career Mode, they're separated into vehicle classes, starting with your first vehicle, the Baja Bugs. You will work your way up to higher racing classes by earning credits from finishing good or sponsor contingency loot. Racing series sponsored by Oakley, BFGoodrich, and Kicker car stereo will offer a slight learning curve and helps to promote progression.</p><p style="">To begin your career you start out with a few thousand credits, but stadium trucks cost around 600,000 credits. Earning enough credits to unlock those while spending credits to upgrade your current vehicles will take a while. Upgrading and tuning your cars is critical to being successful against the AI.</p><h3>PlayStation 3 Issues</h3><p style="">Unfortunately, the PlayStation 3 edition of Baja: Edge of Control suffers from less than spectacular visual quality. Somewhere along the way, the PS3 version of the game took a graphical hit, and doesn't look quite as sharp as the Xbox 360 version. Many critics made note of this in their reviews as well.</p><h2>Xbox 360 Game Installation</h2><p style="">Baja: Edge of Control requires 5.6GB of space to install on an Xbox 360 HDD.</p><h2>Xbox 360 Games on Demand</h2><p style="">On March 16, 2010, Baja: Edge of Control became available on the Xbox 360's Games on Demand service. It costs $19.99 or 1600 Microsoft Points.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>20933</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/1/13158/970418-gb.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/13158/970418-gb.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/1/13158/970418-gb.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/13158/970418-gb.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/13158/970418-gb.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/13158/970418-gb.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/1/13158/970418-gb.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Baja: Edge of Control]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>1</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-6/]]></api_detail_url><id>6</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: E]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2008-09-22 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-86/]]></api_detail_url><id>86</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360 Games Store]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360-games-store/3045-86/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[XBGS]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/baja-edge-of-control/3030-20933/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20934/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-07-07 18:37:23</date_added><date_last_updated>2012-05-30 21:11:54</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[NHL 2K9 is purported to be a refresh of the series, designed to be easy to pick-up-and-play with simplified controls; as was the first NHL licensed title on the Nintendo Wii.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">NHL 2K9 was the first game in the series developed by Visual Concepts, a multi-platform release without any significant differences between the game that appears on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 and Wii. The PlayStation2 release however was simply an update of the previous NHL 2K games on the PlayStation2 originally developed by Kush Games.</p><p style="">NHL 2K9 features player rosters (as defined by the NHLPA), physical and mental attributes, and rule sets appropriate to the on-ice product for the NHL's 2008-2009 season. While these aspects are the default settings, the player is allowed to modify the game rules, presentation aspects, and player attributes to suit their own purposes when playing the game.</p><p style="">In addition to NHL teams with rosters accurate prior to the 2008-2009 season, the game allows players to play as historic teams. These teams are presented with appropriate uniforms, logos and team names, and the season from which they were taken. Player names, however, are absent, as licensing deals with each individual retired players do not exist. Instead they are referred to by position and number.</p><p style="">Commentary during the game is provided by the San Jose Sharks' team of Randy Hahn, Drew Remenda, and John Shrader.</p><h3>New Features on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3</h3><p style="">This iteration in the NHL 2K series does not offer major revisions to the established formula. Instead development focused on adding new control options, improved graphics, more plentiful animations, and presentation changes. 2K9 also features robust online play (up to 12 consoles, accounting for all on-ice players), a new replay editor called Reel Maker, and a new mini game where the player can drive the Zamboni.</p><h3>New Features on the Wii</h3><p style="">NHL 2K9 is the first NHL hockey game to appear on the Wii. The Wii version did not feature online play or the new replay editor. The Wii version does add motion controls, which are incorporated into all aspects of gameplay, including shooting, passing, goaltending, and fighting.</p><h2>Mini Games</h2><p style="">In addition to the normal game modes (Quick Play, Franchise, Season, etc), NHL 2K9 offers mini games that allow for more casual play.</p><p style="">They include:</p><ul><li>Pond Hockey - A four on four (with goalies) where any player from the game can be chosen to form a team, and action takes place on a frozen pond</li><li>Mini Rink - A two on two (with goalies) where any player from the game can be chosen to form a team, and the action takes place on a smaller indoor rink</li><li>Zamboni - During intermissions, the player can control the Zamboni, and attempt to clean a certain percentage of the ice within the given time limit. This can also be done with two players competing for the most amount of ice cleaned.</li></ul><h2>International Teams</h2><p style="">The following international teams appear in the game:</p><ul><li>Austria</li><li>Belarus</li><li>Canada</li><li>Czech Republic</li><li>Denmark</li><li>Finland</li><li>France</li><li>Germany</li><li>Kazakhstan</li><li>Latvia</li><li>Russia</li><li>Slovakia</li><li>Sweden</li><li>Switzerland</li><li>Ukraine</li><li>United

The game features 32 fully modeled Ferraris ranging from the F430 Challenge to the classic Testa Rossa. Cars have setting that can be adjusted like camber, toe-in, and tire pressure before they head out for the big race. Cars can also be customized with a livery editor that is pretty much ripped from Forza 2, so cars can have all sorts of awesome paintjobs ranging from realistic Le Mans liverys to Solid Snakes head if you want. There are 14 tracks in the game, with most of them being liscened, like the UK's Silverstone and Canada's Circuit Gilles Villeneuve. The game also adds thing like weather features that affect your car's ability to handle properly.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>20936</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/0/24/175967-55555.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/24/175967-55555.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/0/24/175967-55555.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/24/175967-55555.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/24/175967-55555.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/24/175967-55555.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/0/24/175967-55555.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Ferrari Challenge Trofeo Pirelli]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating/><original_release_date>2008-08-26 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-18/]]></api_detail_url><id>18</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation Portable]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-portable/3045-18/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PSP]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-19/]]></api_detail_url><id>19</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 2]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-2/3045-19/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS2]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-36/]]></api_detail_url><id>36</id><name><![CDATA[Wii]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/wii/3045-36/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[Wii]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-52/]]></api_detail_url><id>52</id><name><![CDATA[Nintendo DS]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-ds/3045-52/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[DS]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/ferrari-challenge-trofeo-pirelli/3030-20936/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[D3]]></aliases><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20939/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-07-08 11:27:57</date_added><date_last_updated>2014-05-04 19:03:48</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[Players take the role of Maritsu Evil Academy honor-student Mao in his quest to overthrow his father and take the title of Overlord of the Netherworld.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2>Developed by Nippon Ichi, Disgaea 3: Absense of Justice, was released on the PlayStation 3 in Japan on January 31st, 2008.  Eight months later, the title landed in North American shores, distributed by Atlus and published by NIS America, on August 26th, 2008.  <i><b>Disgaea 3</b></i> is not only the first title in the franchise released for the PlayStation 3, but Nippon Ichi's first entry as a developer as well.  <br/><br/> <h2>Story</h2>Mao is a Netherworld Honor Student inside of Maritsu Evil Academy.  This is a school wherein someone achieving honors means they have ditched classes and refused to complete homework.  Proper studying consists of poring over comic books and video games. Raspberyl, one of Mao's female classmates, is a delinquent, meaning she comes to class early and prepared and completes her homework.  <br/><br/>One day, while finishing a manga, Mao realizes that heroes are destined to battle and defeat overlords. He decides to become a hero and defeat the Overlord of the Netherworld, who just so happens to be his father and the Dean of Evil Academy, where Mao is an honor student. With a little push from Mao's conspiring Butler, Geoffrey, Mao's quest for hero status begins.<br/><br/>It isn't long before Raspberyl learns of Mao's plot, which stomps on her own plans to become Maritsu Evil Academy's Number One Delinquent.  Raspberyl follows along with Mao in order to stop him, arguing with him through words rather than battling through violence.  Almaz, a human Hero, watches their argument and rushes in to defeat them.  Mao, however, defeats the human which grants him Almaz's title of Hero.<br/><br/><h2>Changes from Previous Disgaea Games<br/></h2><ul class="plain-list"><li>Story Characters now keep their stat modifiers/increases when Reincarnated.  Created Characters/Monsters keep other certain stats, such as Movement Range, when Reincarnating.</li><li>New Skills for Tower Attacks and ways to build Towers in the first place, such as by a Character walking-up the Tower and not having to be lifted.</li><li>Evilities have been added.  They are abilities that grant certain Characters very unique attributes, such as the Prinny's ability to be Healed 100% for only 1 HL.</li><li>Skills are now purchased using Mana, instead of using the actual weapons to level them up.  You now are required to Reincarnate to unlock higher Skill Levels.</li><li>Skills can no longer be transferred via the Pupil System.  You must now use the Class World to accomplish the same thing (Skills can still be used via the Club System, just not "learned").</li><li>Guns are now based on HIT and SPD stats,  instead of only on the HIT stat.</li><li> Axes now penalized the SPD stat instead of the HIT stat, which makes them not miss as much.</li><li>Geo Symbols have been replaced by Geo Blocks and they can now be stacked.<br/></li><li>Damage output shows higher amount of digits, up to the billions.</li><li>Some sprites use up to 4 times the amount of animation data, yet they are still not HD.</li><li>Backgrounds/Battlefeilds are now in HD.<br/></li></ul><h2><br/>Patch History<br/></h2><ol> <li>Patch 2.0 was released on 12/23/2008 and was 202 MB in size.  This Patch enabled DLC to be installed and fixed a bug with changing music in the Item World, among other minor bug fixes.<br/></li><li>Patch 2.1 was released on 2/10/2009 and was 140 MB in size.  It fixed a bug with the Drop-out Rate, in the Class World, which was introduced in Patch 2.0.<br/></li> </ol> <h2><br/>Trophy and PlayStation Home Support<br/></h2>Trophies (as well as PlayStation Home Rewards) became available in the Japanese Version of Disgaea 3 via a Patch on 3/26/2009.

Borrowing well-received elements from <a href="../../sonic-and-the-secret-rings/61-2512/" rel="nofollow">Sonic and the Secret Rings</a> and <a href="../../sonic-rush/61-9479/" rel="nofollow">Sonic Rush</a>, Sonic Unleashed frequently shifts between a classic side-scrolling perspective and a behind-the-back 3D perspective in an attempt to provide the best of both worlds. In general, Sonic Unleashed features a tighter, much more narrowly focused design when it comes to Sonic's standard ''high speed'' gameplay.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/32127/2183934-su_ps360_adabat_hub.png" data-ref-id="1300-2183934" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.69464544138929" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:69.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/32127/2183934-su_ps360_adabat_hub.png" data-ref-id="1300-2183934"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png"></a><figcaption>Much like in Sonic The Hedgehog (2006), Sonic must navigate hub worlds and interact with NPC's.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Like <a href="/sonic-adventure/3030-7852/" data-ref-id="3030-7852">Sonic Adventure</a> and <a href="/sonic-the-hedgehog/3030-20584/" data-ref-id="3030-20584">Sonic the Hedgehog</a><i>,</i> Unleashed is broken up between two specific modes: Towns and Action Stages. Towns advance the game's storyline and house NPC characters (which offer side missions or items to Sonic) and generally lead the player to access the next level (an Action Stage) via that town's "Gaia Gate". In the PS3/360 Sonic Unleashed, new stages are accessed by collecting Sun and Moon Medals hidden within stages and towns, whereas in Sonic Unleashed for PS2/Wii, Sun and Moon medals are awarded strictly by completing stages. In comparison to past Sonic games, the towns in Sonic Unleashed for PS3/360 are considerably more compact in size and generally can be navigated from end to end in a matter of seconds. However, the Gaia Gates in the PS3/360 Sonic Unleashed, while compact in size, can be immensely confusing to navigate while also being unclear in presenting the player with their next objective to progress through the game.</p><p style="">The Action/Town stage motif is further broken down by what time of day they're accessed. While the sun is out, players are given control of Sonic the Hedgehog, who is equipped with the ability to boost, drift, homing attack, leg stomp, wall kick, and quick-step (a strafing maneuver). Once the sun sets and day turns to night, Sonic transforms into The Werehog, a shaggy beast who uses his claws to attack enemies and long stretchy arms for platforming. After defeating a certain number of enemies and charging up enough energy, the Werehog can "Unleash", making him move faster and hit harder, in addition to being invincible.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12968/350548-scsh611640.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-350548" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="960" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 960px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12968/350548-scsh611640.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-350548"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/12968/350548-scsh611640.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/12968/350548-scsh611640.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Werehog action stage gameplay in Sonic Unleashed PS3/360</figcaption></figure><p style="">In Sonic Unleashed for PS3/360, things like defeating enemies, eating food, and completing certain side missions will earn Sonic experience points that he can use to upgrade his abilities. For Sonic the Hedgehog, Speed and Ring Energy can be upgraded, and for the Werehog, Strength, Combat, Health, Shield, and Unleash can be upgraded, and although the Werehog starts the game with only a small handful of attacks, by upgrading the "Combat" ability, over 30 combo attacks in total can eventually become available for the player to choose from. (In Sonic Unleashed for PS2/Wii, the amount of combo attacks available is much fewer.)</p><h2>Differences Between Versions</h2><p style="">Although Sonic Unleashed was released across four platforms, the version for Nintendo Wii and Playstation 2 (which was developed by <a href="/dimps-corporation/3010-119/" data-ref-id="3010-119">Dimps Corporation</a>) is in fact an entirely separate game that draws heavily from the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 Sonic Unleashed. (which was developed by <a href="/sonic-team/3010-781/" data-ref-id="3010-781">Sonic Team</a>) Some of the differences between the two games include:</p><ul><li>Being two separate games, essentially all of the content in each game is not found in the other, this includes the daytime action stages and werehog stages. Although some of the stages in the Dimps version draw inspiration from the PS3 / 360 version and try to mimic certain environmental features, other stages are completely new.</li></ul><ul><li>The <a href="/dimps-corporation/3010-119/" data-ref-id="3010-119">Dimps</a> version of <i> </i>Sonic Unleashed is the smaller of the two games. The continent of Mazuri doesn't have any action stages in this version (aside from a boss encounter) and the continent of Empire City doesn't exist at all in this version. The game's action stages are also shorter.</li></ul><ul><li>Different game feel when playing as daytime Sonic -- Sonic controls more 'sluggishly' in the <a href="/dimps-corporation/3010-119/" data-ref-id="3010-119">Dimps</a> version and feels drastically heavier in comparison.</li></ul><ul><li>Many of the Dr. Eggman bosses such as Egg Beetle travel much more slowly in the Dimps version, making their difficulty level much more manageable.</li></ul><ul><li>Different boost mechanic for Sonic. In the <a href="/dimps-corporation/3010-119/" data-ref-id="3010-119">Dimps</a> version, boosting is done by pressing the boost button once rather than holding it down. Each time you press the boost button, an entire tank of boost energy is depleted, and the boost lasts for a few seconds or until Sonic touches a wall. Whereas in the <a href="/sonic-team/3010-781/" data-ref-id="3010-781">Sonic Team</a> version, you boost for long as you hold the button down, and are therefore able to use it in very short bursts.</li></ul><ul><li>In the <a href="/dimps-corporation/3010-119/" data-ref-id="3010-119">Dimps</a> version, boosting into an enemy causes Sonic to freeze for a split second and may even cause him to spin-dash, whereas in the <a href="/sonic-team/3010-781/" data-ref-id="3010-781">Sonic Team</a> version, boosting through an enemy is the same as if there was no enemy there at all.</li></ul><ul><li>Compared to the <a href="/sonic-team/3010-781/" data-ref-id="3010-781">Sonic Team</a> version, the Werehog has very small range of attacks and combos in the <a href="/dimps-corporation/3010-119/" data-ref-id="3010-119">Dimps</a> version.</li></ul><ul><li>In the <a href="/sonic-team/3010-781/" data-ref-id="3010-781">Sonic Team</a> version, running as the Werehog is done by holding a button down, whereas in the <a href="/dimps-corporation/3010-119/" data-ref-id="3010-119">Dimps</a> version, it is done by double-tapping the control stick in the direction you want to run. The way Werehog handles when running is also different. In the <a href="/dimps-corporation/3010-119/" data-ref-id="3010-119">Dimps</a> version, Werehog slides along the ground when running, essentially causing him to drift if the player changes direction, making him hard to control, but also possible to run for long stretches at a time if the player is skilled enough. In the <a href="/sonic-team/3010-781/" data-ref-id="3010-781">Sonic Team</a> version, Werehog has poor cornering ability when running, essentially meaning that the player may have to stop running momentarily in order to run in a different direction.</li></ul><ul><li>Aside from the more obvious graphics differences, the framerate in the Wii / PS2 <i> </i><i>Sonic Unleashed</i> seems to be more or less locked at 30 frames per second, whereas the framerate in the PS3 / 360 <i> </i>Sonic Unleashed varies wildly.</li></ul><ul><li>Whereas the towns in the PS3 / 360 <i> </i><i>Sonic Unleashed</i> are navigated in 3D, they exist in the Wii / PS2 <i> </i>Sonic Unleashed strictly as menus, in the vein of a <a href="/point-and-click/3015-75/" data-ref-id="3015-75">point and click adventure</a>. Likewise the NPCs are represented by still pictures (which change pose and/or expression) rather than being 3D in-game character models.</li></ul><ul><li>The Gaia Gates in the PS3 / 360 <i> </i><i>Sonic Unleashed</i> are a unique area for each continent wherein all of the game's action stages and boss encounters are hidden. In the Wii / PS2 <i> </i><i>Sonic Unleashed</i>, all Gaia Gates look largely the same regardless of continent, and are each comprised simply of a large indoor temple room with many doors to enter. Whereas the PS3 / 360 <i> </i><i>Sonic Unleashed</i> Gaia Gates are totally different from each other in layout and appearance, the only non-aesthetic difference between the Gaia Gates on Wii / PS2 are the puzzle rooms they contain and, of course, what stages/bosses the doors lead to.</li></ul><ul><li>The puzzle rooms found in the Gaia Gate temples are an addition exclusive to the Wii / PS2 <i> </i>Sonic Unleashed.</li><li>When playing on Nintendo Wii, you have the option to use motion controls or Wii Classic controller. This is the only version of <i> </i>Sonic Unleashed that offers motion controls.</li></ul><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/32127/2183927-su_ps360_ending.png" data-ref-id="1300-2183927" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.68965517241379" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:69.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/32127/2183927-su_ps360_ending.png" data-ref-id="1300-2183927"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Lastly, in <a href="../../sonic-team/65-781/" rel="nofollow">Sonic Team</a>'s Sonic Unleashed, the player is constantly blocked from proceeding through the game until they have found at least a certain amount of Sun medals and Moon medals. These medallions are hidden in places throughout all the game's areas (both in hubs and action stages) and their location is not revealed to the player through any sort of radar, map, or hint system. They also cannot be earned by performing well in the game. This is in contrast to the Wii / PS2 Sonic Unleashed, where medallions are earned simply by completing stages, attaining S-ranks in the Sonic daytime stages, and reaching time, ring, and score thresholds in the Werehog stages.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p style="">It seemed like another routine assault on Doctor Eggman's latest orbital space station: a showdown with a couple hundred robots, and a fight to the death with the Doctor himself in a giant mechanized suit of armor. As Sonic uses the Chaos Emeralds to transform in to <a href="/super-form/3015-5834/" data-ref-id="3015-5834">Super Sonic</a> to finish the job, Eggman flees the scene, retreating to his final stronghold.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4340/770396-945571_20081022_screen004.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-770396" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4340/770396-945571_20081022_screen004.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-770396"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4340/770396-945571_20081022_screen004.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4340/770396-945571_20081022_screen004.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>"I'll change!"</figcaption></figure><p style="">When Super Sonic catches up with the fearful Doctor, Eggman suddenly slumps to his knees and pleads with the hedgehog to spare him. He swears to change, to reform and stop trying to take over the world. Sonic is a little taken aback at the whole situation; Eggman has never begged for mercy before. This was, unfortunately, exactly the reaction Doctor Eggman was looking for. Catching Sonic off guard, Eggman pushes a button mounted on a nearby console. Large metal prongs raise out of the floor, and suddenly, Super Sonic finds himself trapped inside of a force field. As the machine whirs to life, Sonic is paralyzed and the seven Chaos Emeralds are forcibly extracted from him, de-energizing his Super Sonic form. Laughing madly, Eggman pushes another button on the console, triggering his stronghold's true function: A massive laser cannon. With the magical power of the Chaos Emeralds at its disposal, the cannon fires directly at the planet below, piercing it straight to the core. As the planet shatters in to fragments from the force of the blow, a mysterious, ethereal creature raises from the depths.

Just as he is able to gain his senses as to what is happening, Doctor Eggman gleefully ejects him out of the airlock to the ruined planet below, confident that he has finally won the day. As the transformed ''Werehog'', Sonic plummets toward the ground from space, thus beginning a new adventure to reunite the continents.</p><h2>Locations</h2><p style="">The game of <i>Sonic Unleashed </i>spans up to 9 distinct continents. But not all continents are available all of the time - frequently the player will have to return to locations at specific times of day in order to progress forward in the game. For example, while the player visits the continent of Adabat during the night as the Werehog, they do not return there as Sonic in the day time until some time later.</p><p style="">Each continent featured in <i>Sonic Unleashed</i> generally has one town hub, one Gaia Gate hub, one main daytime stage act, and up to 4 main nighttime Werehog stage acts. In addition to those, a continent can have one or more more boss encounter (as either Sonic or Werehog), and any number of optional mini-acts to complete. (In <i>Sonic Unleashed</i> for PS2 / Wii, these additional acts are sometimes as long as the main stage.)</p><p style="">Note that <i>Sonic Unleashed</i> for PS3 / 360 also includes two Tornado shooting stages, which do not take place on any continent.</p><h3>Apotos</h3><ul><li><ul><li>Stage Name: Windmill Isle</li><li>Based on Mykonos, Greece</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Spagonia</h3><ul><li>Stage Name: Rooftop Run</li><li>Based on France and Europe</li></ul><h3>Mazuri</h3><p style=""><i>(Note: The Mazuri continent does not have any action stages in Sonic Unleashed for PS2 / Wii.

At the time of its release, the Hedgehog Engine was most notable for two relatively cutting-edge features: the rapid speed in which it could load streamed texture data off of the disc, and its ability to render Global Illumination lighting data. Global Illumination lighting is the act of light reflecting off of colored surfaces and bathing the surrounding area in that color. For example, sunlight cast upon a green floor will tint the walls and ceiling a shade of green.</p><p style="">At the time of release, calculating pre-baked Global Illumination data for a single level in <i>Sonic Unleashed</i> would take a networked render farm of 100 computers an average of 2-3 days.</p><h2>Night of the Werehog</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1486/1990291-ghosty.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1990291" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1486/1990291-ghosty.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1990291"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1486/1990291-ghosty.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1486/1990291-ghosty.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption> It's a g-g-g-ghost!</figcaption></figure><p style="">Near the launch of Sonic Unleashed, Sega celebrated the launch of "Sega Sammy Visual Entertainment", an animation studio opened not only to create high-quality CGI for Sega games, but to produce feature-length movies. In addition to animating all of the CGI for <i>Sonic Unleashed</i>, Sega Sammy V.E. produced an 11 minute short film titled "<i>SONIC: NIGHT OF THE WEREHOG</i>". In it, Sonic and Chip are caught in a rainstorm and take shelter in what looks to be an old abandoned mansion.</p><p style="">Unknown to them, a trio of ghosts haunt its halls - two of the specters are armed with cameras and compete for the affection of a lady ghost by snapping photos of their victim's frightened expressions, which she finds amusing. Though Chip is easily scared and makes for easy pickings by the ghosts, as they move in and attempt to scare Sonic, the ghosts are surprised when the storm breaks to reveal a full moon - causing Sonic to transform in to the snarling Werehog. Undeterred, their efforts to humiliate Sonic eventually devolve in to a knock-down drag out fight for supremacy. The two photographer ghosts from <i>Night of the Werehog</i> actually make cameo appearances in Sonic Unleashed, in the side-missions "Tower Terror" and "Fright Fight". In 2010, "Sega Sammy Visual Entertainment" was renamed to "Marza Animation Planet", where they underwent their first feature-length movie project: a CGI adaptation of the anime "Space Pirate: Captain Harlock".</p><h2>Trivia</h2><ul><li>Early builds of the game called all the levels their real-world equivalents. For example, Apotos was originally listed as "<i>Mykonos, Greece</i>".</li></ul><ul><li>The Daytime versions of levels in the Nintendo Wii and Playstation 2 version of <i> </i><i>Sonic Unleashed</i> were made by <a href="/dimps-corporation/3010-119/" data-ref-id="3010-119">Dimps Corporation</a>, the company responsible for the <a href="/sonic-rush/3030-9479/" data-ref-id="3030-9479">Sonic Rush</a> and <a href="/sonic-advance/3030-14191/" data-ref-id="3030-14191">Sonic Advance</a> titles. They had also developed several Dragon Ball Z titles and, after Sonic Unleashed for Wii / PS2, later went on to make <a href="/sonic-colors/3030-31428/" data-ref-id="3030-31428">Sonic Colors</a> for DS, <a href="/sonic-generations/3030-34833/" data-ref-id="3030-34833">Sonic Generations</a> for 3DS, and <a href="/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-episode-1/3030-28078/" data-ref-id="3030-28078">Sonic The Hedgehog 4: Episode 1</a>.</li></ul><ul><li>Though towns are physical locations you explore on-foot in <i> </i><i>Sonic Unleashed</i> for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, towns in <i> </i><i>Sonic Unleashed</i> for Nintendo Wii and Playstation 2 are simply a series of static menu screens. The Gaia Gate entrance stages are also totally different in the Wii/PS2 game. Rather than being outdoor areas, they are instead indoor temple areas containing many sealed doors that lead to action stages, bosses, or puzzle rooms.</li></ul><ul><li>The Japanese versions of <i>Sonic Unleashed</i> for PS3/360 is called "<i>Sonic World Adventure</i>". The versions are nearly identical, except for one change: Mazuri's level, "Savannah Citadel" is renamed to "Clay Castle".</li></ul><ul><li>On the North American box for the Xbox 360 version of <i>Sonic Unleashed</i>, an icon is listed for "Leaderboards". Sonic Unleashed contains no leaderboards, and all other versions of the game replace this icon with one for "Content Download".</li></ul><ul><li>The music for "Savannah Citadel" during the day is actually a remix of a tune from <a href="/sonic-the-hedgehog/3030-2465/" data-ref-id="3030-2465">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> on the Master System used during the credits sequence.</li></ul><ul><li>Similarly, the main orchestral song titled "The World Adventure" contains numerous similarities to the music used for Angel Island Zone in <a href="/sonic-the-hedgehog-3/3030-4628/" data-ref-id="3030-4628">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a>.</li></ul><ul><li>In the "Town" for the final location in the game (Eggmanland), players can find and talk to three of Dr. Eggman's Guard Robots, the Model Numbers of which are references to various Sonic games throughout the years: <i>EF-MD1991</i>, <i>EF-DC1998</i> and <i>EF-XB2006</i>. EF-MD1991 is a reference to the release of Sonic the Hedgehog on the Mega Drive in 1991, EF-DC1998 being a reference to the release of <a href="/sonic-adventure/3030-7852/" data-ref-id="3030-7852">Sonic Adventure</a> on the Sega Dreamcast in 1998, and EF-XB2006 referencing <a href="/sonic-the-hedgehog/3030-20584/" data-ref-id="3030-20584">SONIC the Hedgehog</a> on the Xbox 360/PS3 in 2006.</li></ul><ul><li>Once players talk to the three Guard Robots in Eggmanland, their character profiles are added to the game's Encyclopedia. EF-XB2006's character profile describes him as "lacking real world experience", likely a reference to <a href="/sonic-the-hedgehog/3030-20584/" data-ref-id="3030-20584">SONIC the Hedgehog</a> (2006)'s extremely poor critical reception. In similar fashion, EF-DC1998's description says that he was "Once a model mainstay of the Egg Fighter Force" but he has grown tired of working and now plays hookie to avoid his duties. This is potentially a reference to the fact that, prior to <i> </i>Sonic Unleashed, most 3D Sonic games were heavily based off of the ground work established by <a href="/sonic-adventure/3030-7852/" data-ref-id="3030-7852">Sonic Adventure</a> in 1998.</li></ul><ul><li><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/58947/1361849-sonicunleasheddreamcast.png" data-ref-id="1300-1361849" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/58947/1361849-sonicunleasheddreamcast.png" data-ref-id="1300-1361849"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/5/58947/1361849-sonicunleasheddreamcast.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/5/58947/1361849-sonicunleasheddreamcast.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Dr. Eggman with his Dreamcast</figcaption></figure> Though never visible for more than a couple seconds at a time, it would appear that Dr. Eggman keeps a <a href="/dreamcast/3045-37/" data-ref-id="3045-37">Dreamcast</a> by his side wherever he goes, as any time you're afforded the ability to peek inside of his Eggmobile, it's always sitting next to him.

It features the famous Olympian snowboarder, <a data-ref-id="3005-3668" href="/shaun-white/3005-3668/" slug="shaun-white">Shaun White</a>. The Wii version is extremely different from the 360 and PS3 versions. The 360 and PS3 versions of this game feature more realistic graphics, while the Wii version had a "cartoon-y" art style and took advantage of the Wii balance board. Both versions of the game include different stories and levels as well</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">The gameplay in Shaun White Snowboarding heavily revolves around collecting coins scattered around the four mountains in the game: Alaska, Japan, Europe, and Park City. Once the player collects all of the coins Shaun White teaches you a new "focus move" that allows the player to access new areas and challenges.</p><h2>Target Version</h2><p style="">The Target edition of Shaun White Snowboarding features an extra mountain that is covered in Target-related branding.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>20954</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/1817673-box_swsnow.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/1817673-box_swsnow.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/1817673-box_swsnow.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/1817673-box_swsnow.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/1817673-box_swsnow.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1817673-box_swsnow.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/1817673-box_swsnow.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Shaun

The game puts an emphasis on performing tricks and customizing ATVs with special parts.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Pure was announced on February 14, 2008 as an off-road ATV racing game from <a data-ref-id="3010-6353" href="/black-rock-studio/3010-6353/">Black Rock Studio</a> (previously known as <a data-ref-id="3010-4268" href="/climax-racing/3010-4268/">Climax Racing</a>), the developer of <a data-ref-id="3025-542" href="/motogp/3025-542/">MotoGP</a> and <a data-ref-id="3025-41" href="/atv-offroad-fury/3025-41/">ATV Offroad Fury</a>. Published by <a data-ref-id="3010-1312" href="/disney-interactive-inc/3010-1312/">Disney Interactive</a>, Pure was released in North America on September 16, 2008 for the <a data-ref-id="3045-35" href="/playstation-3/3045-35/">PlayStation 3</a>, <a data-ref-id="3045-20" href="/xbox-360/3045-20/">Xbox 360</a>, and <a data-ref-id="3045-94" href="/pc/3045-94/">PC</a>. The game's main features are the tricks, where progressively harder tricks can be performed, and the customizable ATVs (Black Rock claims that there are over 100,000 different vehicle combinations).</p><p style="">There was a generally positive critical reception for Pure. When it was showcased at E3 2008, Pure won the Best Racing Game of E3 2008 from Official Xbox Magazine, Best Driving Game from Game Trailers, and Best Racing Game (Xbox 360) from IGN. Upon its release, it garnered positive reviews, with an 84% (PC), 85.4% (Xbox 360), and 82.6% (PlayStation 3) average on Game Rankings. Critics praised Pure's intuitive controls and trick system, graphics, and style, but criticized it for a general lack of depth.</p><p style="">On Thursday, September 4, 2008, a demo for Pure was released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The demo includes Mount Garda track, located in Italy; one of 35 tracks in the full game. The demo also includes a tutorial and test track to get the player accustomed to the game. The demo is 1.31 gigabytes. The demo was finally released in Asia on the 27th of May, 2009</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4824/227919-944936_20080703_screen001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-227919" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.553125" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:55.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4824/227919-944936_20080703_screen001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-227919"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4824/227919-944936_20080703_screen001.jpg"></a><figcaption>Tricks can be performed with various button combinations.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Pure's gameplay is mostly centered around the usage of tricks and preloading. By quickly flicking the control stick down and then up right as going off of a jump, the player can do tricks by pressing a button and holding a direction on the control stick. At first, only the lowest tier tricks are unlocked, but as the race progresses and more boost is gained through the performance of tricks, more tricks (including long and breathtaking Special Tricks) are unlocked. However, if the same trick is performed repeatedly, then it is ranked as "Lame" or "Stale," rather than "Fresh," and less boost is gained.</p><p style="">There are three types of events in the single player campaign of Pure. These three events are done over the course of the World Tour, which is ten different stages with varying amounts of events. As the World Tour progresses, more Special Tricks, parts, riders, and stages are unlocked for other modes in the game. In addition, the computer controlled riders become progressively difficult throughout all modes of the game.</p><p style="">Sprint type events are the shortest. They, by default, consist of five short laps around a generally circular course, with few obstacles and jumps (typically one obstacle). Only later in the World Tour do the stages begin having shortcuts, and taking these shortcuts becomes key to winning the race.</p><p style="">Freestyle events are focused around performing tricks to gain more points. In addition, this event adds a gas meter, and if that runs out then the event is over. This event has a variety of power ups spread throughout the stage. These power ups consist of doubled points, extra gas, extra boost, and Special Tricks. The more tricks that are pulled, the higher the combo becomes, with each trick adding another multiplier to the combo. This makes it very possible to have incredibly high combos, even reaching the millions.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6162/939787-pure_2009_02_18_02_37_09_15.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-939787" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6162/939787-pure_2009_02_18_02_37_09_15.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-939787"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6162/939787-pure_2009_02_18_02_37_09_15.jpg"></a><figcaption>Vehicle creation in Pure.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Race events are a typical race, and the longest of the three events. They have three laps that consist of sharp turns, vertigo jumps (jumps on which Special Tricks can be performed), and many other jumps as well. Race events also have many shortcuts, making it possible to stay far in first even later in the World Tour.</p><p style="">As the World Tour progresses, more and more parts are unlocked for the ATVs. Engines are unlocked, starting at a D-rank engine, and ending at an A-rank engine. Vehicles can be customized in just about everything, from each particular internal part, to the external body. Color can be chosen as well. However, it is also possible to create a car based on the best stats by choosing "Quick Build Race" or "Quick Build Freestyle."</p><h3>Multiplayer</h3><p style="">There is a multiplayer mode which allows for up to 16 players across the three available events, as well as a few extra modes. Unlike the World Tour, there is no requirement to have a certain type of engine, making players who haven't unlocked an A-rank engine at a large disadvantage. There is also a Championship that is available, in which players do several predetermined events, although the Championship is only available in Player Matches (and not Ranked).</p><p style="">The last mode available online that is unique to the multiplayer is Free Ride. In Free Ride, players can view particular records for each stage, and then compete to defeat those. Therefore, Free Ride is more like a time trial mode than a multiplayer mode, as the player is not directly competing with somebody on the track.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p style="">Pure contains a variety of licensed rock and electronic tracks, chosen to fit with the action of the game as best as possible. A partial track listing has been released, although portions of the soundtrack remain unknown.</p><ul><li>The Answer - "Into the Gutter"</li><li>Fred Baker - "Genius Touch"</li><li>Jeff Beck - "Grease Monkey"</li><li>Calyx &amp; Teebee -" Dual Processed" Featuring MC Verse</li><li>The Datsuns - "Maximum Heartbreak" and "Sittin' Pretty"</li><li>Diet Kong - "With Magic"</li><li>Adam Freeland - "Spin Machine"</li><li>The Futureheads - "Beginning of the Twist"</li><li>DJ Hyper - "We Control"</li><li>Midfield General - "On the Road"</li><li>The Music - "Strength in Numbers"</li><li>My Luminaries - "The Sound of Music"</li><li>Noise Control - "Cities of Dreams' and 'Mud Bath"</li><li>Pendulum - "Granite' and 'Showdown"</li><li>Pop Levi - "Wannamama"</li><li>Qemists - "Drop Audio' and 'Stomp Box"</li><li>The Radishes - "Good Machine"</li><li>Silvertone - "Try"</li><li>The Subways - "Rock and Roll Queen"</li><li>Tapeworm - "Getting Through"</li><li>The Whigs - "Need You Need You"</li><li>Zero DB - "Late in the Day' and 'Redline"</li><li>Wolfmother - "Woman"</li><li>We Are Scientists - "Inaction"</li><li>Blindside - "For the Nation"</li></ul><h2>Bundle with Lego Batman for the Xbox 360</h2><p style="">Following 2008's holiday bundle of <a href="/">Lego Indiana Jones</a> and <a href="/">Kung Fu Panda</a>, the <a href="/">Xbox 360</a> Pro model was bundled with <a data-ref-id="3030-20822" href="/lego-batman-the-video-game/3030-20822/">Lego Batman</a> and Pure during the 2009 holiday season at no additional cost.</p><h2>Xbox 360 Game Installation</h2><p style="">Pure requires 4.4GB of space to install on an Xbox 360 HDD.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>20957</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/1/13158/1090553-gb.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/13158/1090553-gb.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/1/13158/1090553-gb.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/13158/1090553-gb.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/13158/1090553-gb.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/13158/1090553-gb.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/1/13158/1090553-gb.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Pure]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>13</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-6/]]></api_detail_url><id>6</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: E]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-7/]]></api_detail_url><id>7</id><name><![CDATA[PEGI: 3+]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2008-09-16 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pure/3030-20957/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[PES 09

Starting as ISS (International Superstar Soccer) way back on the NES the game turned its back on the arcade style and adopted a realistic view that appealed to hardcore football fans. Argentinian forward  Lionel Messi has been announced as the cover athlete for the game.<br/><br/>This will be the second outing on the <a data-ref-id="3055-1463" href="/playstation-3/3055-1463/" slug="playstation-3">  PS3</a> and third on the <a data-ref-id="3055-1229" href="/xbox-360/3055-1229/" slug="xbox-360">  X360</a>. <a data-ref-id="3030-13165" href="/pro-evolution-soccer-2008/3030-13165/" slug="pro-evolution-soccer-2008">  PES2008</a> was view to many fans as half a game as it felt unfinished and unpolished which was very unlike the other games in the series. PES2009 though sets out to be different, creator <a data-ref-id="3040-89631" href="/shingo-takatsuka/3040-89631/" slug="shingo-takatsuka">  Shingo 'Seabass' Takatsuka</a> has revealed that he's gone back to the drawing board for PES 2009 making sure that this instalment is true to the series.<br/><br/>Another great bit of news is that Master League teams will be usable online and a much improved editing system that allows for imports of images and sounds.<br/><br/></p><h2>Gameplay</h2>Gameplay for Pro Evolution Soccer 2009 has been improved from last years iteration. The "Team vision" AI system has been improved, better of the ball movement such as running into space to recieve a pass and the game and better ball movements. PES2009 has new air resistance calculations for the trajectory of the ball. The ground condition also impacts the gameplay. There is also friction calculations to affect the balls movement in terms of ground conditions, backspin routines are calculated which allows the ball to slow down realistically and the balls bounce on the ground is improved. There is a new manual passing system and a new off the ball movement system that allows you to run into space while the AI takes control and then finds the pass once you are in space. Slowdown has been removed in matches and replays.<br/><br/>There is also the inclusion of "Become a Legend" mode which will allow you to take control of one player in a team. This changes the way you play the game and you will have to work hard to "become a legend".<br/><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6149/639376-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-639376" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.55226824457594" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:55.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6149/639376-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-639376"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6149/639376-1.jpg"></a><figcaption>Control One Player and Earn Points</figcaption></figure> <br/><h3>Be a Legend mode<br/></h3> <br/>Be a legend mode makes its first return to the Konami franchise since making its début on the Japanese only release of Winning Eleven 2007 under the name of fantasia mode. It required you to take control of a singel player on the pitch much like Fifa 08 be a pro mode. This years release enables you to choose between a from a range of positions such as SMF, AMF, CMF, SS or a CF. Defenders and goalkeepers have not yet been confirmed. After selecting a position you are then required to create your players appearance from an extensive editing mode which allows you to scan a  JPEG portrait of yourself into the game, as well as the regular editing tools or just using a default character. The way be a legend mode has you progress through the game is by starting out in the youth system of a team at the age of 17 which consists of playing a series of friendlies with your senior squad as well as other teams. How you're performances are will dictate how quickly  you will  progressing to the bench on your way to the senior team. whilst on the bench you are simply given the task of  sitting aside  for several games waiting for your coach to give you your chance to shine. During the season you will acquire<h3> </h3>skill points that are used to enhance your players kicking technique, dribbling technique, balance, power, stamnia and speed. The amount of skill points you obtain are determined by your performances on the pitch. <br/><br/><br/><h2> <b>Licensed Content</b></h2><h3>Competitions</h3>Pro Evolution Soccer 2009 have obtained the rights to the UEFA Champions League for the next 4 years.

Rather than continue the tale of the last trilogy, <a href="/ubisoft-entertainment/3010-82/" data-ref-id="3010-82">Ubisoft</a> decided to create a new world with all new characters. Prince of Persia introduces new gameplay elements and a fresh graphical style to the series. Prince of Persia was released on December 2, 2008 in the US.</p><p style="">This game was created by <a href="/ubisoft-montreal-studios/3010-1559/" data-ref-id="3010-1559">Ubisoft Montreal</a>, using the same core team that worked on <a href="/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time/3030-5235/" data-ref-id="3030-5235">Prince of Persia: Sands of Time</a>. This game is not a continuation of the <i>Sands of Time</i> trilogy however, but rather the start of a new trilogy with a new Prince and a new world. The game runs on a updated version of the <a href="/anvil-game-engine/3015-3972/" data-ref-id="3015-3972">Scimitar Engine</a> created for <a href="/assassins-creed/3030-2950/" data-ref-id="3030-2950">Assassin's Creed</a>, which allows the game to be non-linear, yet still allow the Prince to traverse the land with his usual acrobatic prowess.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/732071-pop_s_025.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-732071" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/732071-pop_s_025.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-732071"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/732071-pop_s_025.jpg"></a><figcaption>The Prince and Elika</figcaption></figure><p style="">The adventure begins with a new <a href="/the-prince/3005-2623/" data-ref-id="3005-2623">Prince</a> of Persia, a wanderer, who is returning home from an adventure on a donkey named <a href="/farah/3005-1141/" data-ref-id="3005-1141">Farah</a> with a king's treasure in gold, which he earned on his previous venture. Not yet the Prince to be, he desires nothing more then to spend his treasure on many luxuries, including women and liquor, and carpets very thick.</p><p style="">However quite suddenly, he is caught in a fierce sandstorm and is blown away. When the sandstorm subsides, he finds himself in a mythical garden of beauty, dominated at its center by a massive <i>Tree of Life</i>. The Prince and a girl, <a href="/elika/3005-1024/" data-ref-id="3005-1024">Elika</a>, find each other, and, in the same predicament, decide to help each other. Together, they venture to the center of this grand oasis. When they arrive at the center, they witness the destruction of the tree, and the freedom of <a href="/ahriman/3005-9313/" data-ref-id="3005-9313">Ahriman</a>, the ancient god of darkness. After being set free, Ahriman starts destroying the Tree of Light and the land is full with darkness and evil. The Prince, with the aid of Elika and her new found magic, take up arms against Ahriman's corruption, in an attempt to drive it back and cleanse the world with light once again.</p><p style="">With Elika's help the Prince travels to the four different locations: the <i>Citadel</i>, the <i>City of Light</i>, the <i>Royal Palace</i>, and the <i>Vale</i> to vanquish each of the four bosses. Once each boss is defeated the duo travel back to the temple to make sure Ahriman is sealed in the Tree of Light. When they get there they are confronted by Elika's father, the King, who attempts to stop them one last time. Upon defeat the King leaps into an abyss towards the Tree of Light. A second later Ahriman rises up in the form of a dragon monster and tries to kill the Prince and Elika. From the viewpoint of Ahriman you must travel around the room and heal the remaining areas surrounding the Tree. Once this is done Ahriman is captured back in the Tree, and Elika collapses. The Prince realizes that Elika has died, he understands now that Elika is giving bits of her life to heal all of the lands throughout the game. He now realizes that Elika's father only realized Ahriman so that Elika could live, it seems one cannot live without the other. The Prince lays her down outside the temple and travels back to the beginning of each area. In front of each of the four area's is a tree similar to the Tree of Light. The prince cuts down all four trees and travels back to the Tree of Light in the temple.</p><p style="">One final blow and he cuts down the tree of light that you worked so hard to restore throughout the game, releasing Ahriman back into the world as the King had previously done. The Prince carries the huge ball of light to where Elika is at the front of the temple and places it over her. Elika then comes back to life. The final scene shows the prince walking away from the temple with Elika in his arms, as Ahriman in his full demon form flies overhead and out of the scene, released into the world once more. The final trophy/achievement for the game is awarded at this point, it is titled <i>" To Be Continued."</i></p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1246/609043-prince_of_persia_4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-609043" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1246/609043-prince_of_persia_4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-609043"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1246/609043-prince_of_persia_4.jpg"></a><figcaption>Healing the lands with light again.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The Prince is able to traverse the land, with what has now become the standard arsenal of moves for him. He is able to wall-run, leap from wall to wall, swing on poles, and of course jump and hang from ledges.</p><p style="">New to this game however are the inclusion of the Prince's <i>claws</i> called the Gauntlet, which are a sort of glove he wears on his left hand which can smash into walls and save him from falling, though neither battle wounds nor falling end up in Prince's death due to help of his companion Elika, who will save him whenever he is in danger. By using the Gauntlet he is able to slide down walls and even block attacks. The game also features a healthy smattering of environmental puzzles which the Prince can solve with help from his new friend Elika who aids him on his adventure, both in combat and adventure.</p><p style="">Unlike other titles, the Prince will not collect new equipment to aid him in his journey. There is no special armor or gauntlet to collect in the game. The sword the Prince begins with is the one which he wields until the end, in an effort to make it a memorable weapon. Players will, however, gain new magical powers which Elika will use. Once the player has collected enough <i>Light Seeds</i>, they can be traded in at the temple for the player's ability of choice. These light seeds appear throughout every level once it has been cleansed, and many are challenging to obtain. The abilities which can be unlocked will allow the player to access new areas once inaccessible, as well as grab light seeds once unobtainable.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1246/609044-prince_of_persia_5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-609044" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1246/609044-prince_of_persia_5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-609044"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1246/609044-prince_of_persia_5.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1246/609044-prince_of_persia_5.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Hunter attacking the Prince and Elika.</figcaption></figure><p style="">In the previous trilogy of games, the Prince utilized the <a href="/sands-of-time/3055-259/" data-ref-id="3055-259">Sands of Time</a> in order to rewind time and fix any mistakes he had made. In this Prince of Persia, there are no <i>Sands of Time</i>, rather, Elika will help the Prince to jump higher and farther. Elika proves to be an excellent help throughout the game, and has been designed to help rather then hinder the Prince's success.</p><p style="">Prince of Persia contains light puzzle elements, with one or two puzzles in each of the game's zones. The puzzles involve lever pulling, whether to put walls in place, or open floodgates. The puzzles are meant to add variety to the game which is heavy on platforming.</p><p style="">Combat has also been changed, with a focus on one-on-two: the Prince and Elika versus an enemy. Elika is able to perform combos seamlessly with the Prince. The design philosophy driving the new combat system is to make each battle both more intense and cinematic. Fights are not as common as they were in the previous games, but aim to keep the player on the edge of their seat using intense, cinematic imagery.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2179/181809-pop4__4_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-181809" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2179/181809-pop4__4_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-181809"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2179/181809-pop4__4_.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2179/181809-pop4__4_.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>In tradition of the other Prince of Persia's, the game has great acrobatics.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The combat system assigns attacks to four main buttons. Elika, the Prince's sword, and the gauntlet are all assigned to their own button, as well as one button reserved for 'acrobatic' attacks. The player can initiate a combo with any of the four choices, then continue with another. Both timing and attack selection are key to creating larger combos. If the player hesitates, they miss the opportunity to attack. Visual cues in the on screen action will make the player aware of the attack they should next perform on some occasions, and any other attempts will end the combo. These are usually reserved for combo finishers, however, as the first few choices are generally up to the player.</p><p style="">The Prince can also block attacks and counter blows. Holding the block button will guard most attacks, but pressing it strategically will create an opportunity to counter. The player must beware, however, as enemies can also counter. The combat system also employs quick time events at various times throughout a battle. The player will need to repeatedly press buttons to push the enemy away or quickly press a prompted button to avoid a final blow. Throughout the game, the player will encounter a variety of enemies which require creative thinking to take down, such as <i>The Warrior</i>, who cannot be harmed by the sword, gauntlet, or magic.</p><h2>Development</h2><p style="">Prince of Persia's development team began conception right as <a href="/prince-of-persia-the-two-thrones/3030-21380/" data-ref-id="3030-21380">Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones</a> was released, however, tangible proof of the game was found when, on September 21, 2006 a leaked concept art hit the net. Ubisoft remained silent and made no comment. On January 23, 2008 some more screen shots from the game were leaked onto the internet, while the game was in it's conception phase. Once again, Ubisoft did not comment.</p><p style="">In May 2008, Ubisoft finally released two videos of a concept artist designing the Prince and Elika confirming the existence of the game officially under the Prince of Persia title. One video shows a full-bodied new Prince being speed drawn using Photoshop. The other art drawing video detailed Elika and finally the third speed concept art emerged in July, 2008, this time depicting a prime enemy; <a href="/the-hunter/3005-7270/" data-ref-id="3005-7270">The Hunter</a>.

It continues the story of the retail game, increases the difficulty, adds a new power for Elika and attack for the Prince, reveals a brand new location, and includes two unlockable skins that become available after completing the Epilogue.</p><p style="">Jamal Rguigui has said that the <a href="/ubisoft-montreal-studios/3010-1559/" data-ref-id="3010-1559">Ubisoft Montreal</a> team decided to go on ahead full throttle with some cool ideas that the team had during and post-production and developed a unique DLC that would enhance the experience for Prince of Persia fans. It was not content that was cut, but was content that was further polished and elaborated on. He continued to say that they had a lot of ambitions for the DLC and that they were filtering all the feedback from the industry and the community of gamers. Players can expect to have a specific experience that will give them more content with superior difficulty and pace. This is one of the most ambitious DLC projects from Ubisoft, and it adds to the understanding of Prince of Persia's new world and characters.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10024/826511-6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-826511" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.52173913043478" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:52.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10024/826511-6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-826511"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10024/826511-6.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10024/826511-6.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>New powers away!</figcaption></figure><p style="">Elika will be receiving a new power that is called <i>Energize</i> which is a travel based power that adds a timing challenge. This power allows Elika, for a short period of time, to materialize an area of the environment that was previously destroyed. Therefore, the Prince and Elika will be able to access areas previously impossible to reach without this power. There is also a new enemy in the form of the Shapeshifter which is an enemy that takes the form of two of Ahriman's most fearsome Lieutenants, the Warrior and the Hunter. Though their physical form is familiar to our heroes and the player, it will requires a particular strategy to defeat the Shapeshifter, rewarding the player that takes advantage of the new sprint feature exclusive to the Epilogue. As mentioned the content will also include a feature called sprint clashing. When the Prince and the enemy are at a distance, the player can mash the acrobatics button, which will allow the enemy and the Prince to sprint at each other and attack. The new area is called the <i>Underground Palace</i> and it is completely corrupted. Ubisoft has listened to the feedback and upped the pace of the game with more aggressive A.I and more complex traps. The content will also have new Trophies and Achievements.</p><p style="">It is not necessary to have finished the Prince of Persia game to play the DLC. This content is available both Xbox 360 and PS3 on March 5 for 800 MS points and 10$ respectively.</p><h2>Areas</h2><p style="">Prince of Persia is divided into four different areas, each of which has its own visual style. Each zone is divided into six areas: one introductory area, four main Fertile Ground areas, and one final area behind a black gate.</p><p style="">To reach the final area, the player must first heal all fertile grounds in the zone. Players can progress through each area as they choose, but are limited to the power they posses. Initially, all introductory fertile grounds must be healed to progress. Once the player chooses a power, however, they can choose which power they want, and Elika will inform the player which areas are accessible with each power. Each power will open up four areas in two zones each. The Prince can freely travel between each level with no load times as each is connected.</p><p style="">The areas are as follows:</p><h3>The Citadel</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22446/835854-798745_the_hunter0a_large.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-835854" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="1.3933333333333" data-width="300" style="width: 300px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:139.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22446/835854-798745_the_hunter0a_large.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-835854"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22446/835854-798745_the_hunter0a_large.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22446/835854-798745_the_hunter0a_large.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Hunter, who stalks his prey in The Citadel</figcaption></figure><p style="">The long abandoned guard post of the city, the Citadel is currently where <a href="/the-hunter/3005-7270/" data-ref-id="3005-7270">The Hunter</a> resides.</p><h3>The City of Light</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1393/1208422-popwarriorcorrupted.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1208422" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="1.2857142857143" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:128.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1393/1208422-popwarriorcorrupted.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1208422"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1393/1208422-popwarriorcorrupted.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1393/1208422-popwarriorcorrupted.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Warrior, who rules over the City of Light</figcaption></figure><p style="">The City of Light was once a place of wonders, but once it came into <a href="/the-warrior/3005-8950/" data-ref-id="3005-8950">The Warrior</a>'s hands, it is now a place of destruction.

The Royal Palace is an area which holds many memories for Elika, and many important areas for the kingdom. The Royal Spire serves as the seat of power in the land, and was where Elika's father sat on his throne, and the hall of coronation, where the king receives his crown. The king and queen were wed in the Spire of Dreams, a place that was said to make one's dreams come true. Once upon a time, the Royal Palace was a place of wonder. Actors filled the cavern, and the lush gardens were truly a sight to behold. After Elika's mother died, the Royal Palace began to lose beauty. The gardens withered away along with the king's sanity, and the Royal Palace is now merely a fraction of its former glory.</p><h3><b>The Vale</b></h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1393/1208417-alchemistpop.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1208417" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="1.9166666666667" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:191.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1393/1208417-alchemistpop.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1208417"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1393/1208417-alchemistpop.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1393/1208417-alchemistpop.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Alchemist, who resides in The Vale</figcaption></figure><p style=""><a href="/the-alchemist/3005-8951/" data-ref-id="3005-8951">The Alchemist</a> claims the Vale as his home, dwelling within the Observatory, where he brings terror to The Vale.

This is when Ahriman's voice crept in and offered him a solution to his dilemma. The Hunter was to offer his soul to Ahriman, and in exchange would be allowed to hunt for all eternity, the one creature that could pose any sort of challenge: man.</p><h3>The Concubine</h3><p style="">The Concubine used to be a beautiful women, who had the ability to trick any man she wanted into doing whatever she desired.

His kingdom was facing great problems and were constantly at war, and so Ahriman came to the Warrior and offered him great power in exchange for his soul and servitude. To protect his people, the Warrior accepted, and he was suddenly transformed into a great and powerful being. However when his enemies were defeated his people were scared and shunned him, and he realized that he had become the very thing he had fought.

He would stay in his quarters for many hours pouring over books, and studying. Eventually he became fascinated by Ahriman's corruption and strived to study it, with hopes that he would eventually be able to control and manipulate it. He used the Ahura as slaves, and he built great machines that would allow him to hold vast amounts of corruption. As he became older, he started practising further dark arts in attempt to figure out how to live forever, so that he could continue his studies. At this point the Ahura imprisoned the Alchemist and he was to die. This is when Ahriman appeared to the Alchemist. In exchange for his soul, Ahriman would allow the Alchemist to have eternal life. The Alchemist accepted.</p><h3>The Shapeshifter</h3><p style="">Appears in the Underground Palace in the Epilogue DLC.

Zur worked on previous Prince of Persia titles as well as the soundtrack for <a href="/fallout-3/3030-20504/" data-ref-id="3030-20504">Fallout 3</a>. Chatwood has composed music for seven other Prince of Persia titles. Stuart Chatwood comes from the Canadian rock band The Tea Party.</p><p style="">There is different music for each of the four lands that you visit throughout the game as well as new themes for each combat scenario you encounter. The music blends melodies with eastern European touches combined with guitars and cinematic overtones.</p><p style="">Music supervisor for Prince of Persia, Simon Landry, says this about the games score: <i>“The musical challenge for the Prince of Persia soundtrack was to further push the interactivity, the diversity and the emotional complexity. The colossal achievement of Inon and Stuart’s work is to have composed such a powerful and impressive interactive musical odyssey. The complementary approach of these two skilled composers pushes musical boundaries and creates a fascinating and authentic world."</i></p><h2>Limited Edition Offer</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4515/817708-200519b.png" data-ref-id="1300-817708" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="1.2292993630573" data-width="157" style="width: 157px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:122.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4515/817708-200519b.png" data-ref-id="1300-817708"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4515/817708-200519b.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4515/817708-200519b.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Limited Edition Packaging</figcaption></figure><p style="">Ubisoft announced that people who pre-ordered Prince of Persia would get a free upgrade to a Limited Edition.

The images are done in the style of the site's other cartoons with a more paint like and stylized approach. The book has 16 pages of artwork, each accompanied with a page of text. The story details one of the four bosses encountered in the game, The Hunter. The story tells how a Prince, having killed all worthy prey, becomes bored with the act of hunting. He sells his soul to Ahriman, the evil God in order to bring excitement to the hunt. Ahriman makes him a monster that is now being hunted by people, allowing him to hunt them back. Tycho, who writes posts and comics for PA, wrote the story. Gabe, Penny Arcade's illustrator, drew the story book's illustrations.</p><p style="">Gabe commented how he wanted to learn all new techniques for this story book to bring something original to the table. He found inspiration in his children's story books and picture books. Gabe had this to say about the process:</p><p style=""><i>"For my part I wanted this story book to feel authentic. So I raided my son's book shelf and I also pulled out a box of baby stuff my Mom had given me. It had some awesome Little Golden Books that I had read as a kid. With all these great books around as inspiration I sat down to use Photoshop in a way that I never had before. I wanted to really "paint" with it and that meant learning all new techniques."</i> The full story book can be found <a href="http://prince-of-persia.us.ubi.com/PA/html/index.php"

The developer has also stated that there will be multiple ways to complete objectives from standing back with a <a href="/bow/3055-73/" data-ref-id="3055-73">bow</a> <a href="/arrow/3055-4447/" data-ref-id="3055-4447">and arrow</a> to <a href="/horse-riding/3015-205/" data-ref-id="3015-205">riding in with a horse</a>, or even using <a href="/siege-warfare/3015-2568/" data-ref-id="3015-2568">siege weapons</a>, although it has also been said that you will have to <a href="/unlockables/3015-1414/" data-ref-id="3015-1414">unlock some weapons and horses</a> rather then just being given everything.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">The gameplay is very similar to the <a href="/star-wars-battlefront/3025-696/" data-ref-id="3025-696">Star Wars Battlefront series</a>. There are command points where you spawn to kill the enemy, but in the campaigns there will be</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15292/465713-lotrconquest_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-465713" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.608" data-width="250" style="width: 250px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:60.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15292/465713-lotrconquest_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-465713"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15292/465713-lotrconquest_1.jpg"></a><figcaption>The Lord Of The Rings Conquest Battle Scene</figcaption></figure><p style="">variations. In the command points you pick a class to play, only four classes has been released so far in the good campaign. The <a href="/rogues/3015-1460/" data-ref-id="3015-1460">scout</a>, the rogue of the bunch, warrior, the tank, <a href="/archer/3015-3355/" data-ref-id="3015-3355">archer</a> and <a href="/wizards/3015-1694/" data-ref-id="3015-1694">mage</a>. The developers have hailed their new melee system which has significantly improved the warrior and tank classes. The archer and mage classes have both been shown to operate in the typical shooter model that the Star Wars Battlefront games have made popular. <a href="/pandemic-studios/3010-1779/" data-ref-id="3010-1779">Pandemic Games</a> said that if you wanted, you could play the whole game in a <a href="/first-person-perspective/3015-330/" data-ref-id="3015-330">FPS style</a> using archers and mages. There are also <a href="/heroes/3015-315/" data-ref-id="3015-315">heroes</a> you get in certain parts of the campaigns, like <a href="/aragorn/3005-2280/" data-ref-id="3005-2280">Aragorn</a>, <a href="/gimli/3005-1638/" data-ref-id="3005-1638">Gimli</a> and Sauron. Once you complete the first campaign, you can play through the evil campaign. In the evil campaign, Frodo is caught dropping the Ring into <a href="/mount-doom/3035-649/" data-ref-id="3035-649">Mount Doom</a>, and goes back through <a href="/mines-of-moria/3035-1736/" data-ref-id="3035-1736">Moria</a>, Weathertop, <a href="/the-shire/3035-335/" data-ref-id="3035-335">the Shire</a>, and more, ending with a battle at the Elven home of <a href="/rivendell/3035-1168/" data-ref-id="3035-1168">Rivendell</a>. This concept is not unique, as games such as <a href="/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-battle-for-middle-earth-ii/3030-4867/" data-ref-id="3030-4867">The Lord of the Rings: Battle for Middle Earth 2</a> featured evil campaigns with events that did not actually occur in the series.</p><h2>Multiplayer</h2><p style="">The online multiplayer features 4 modes: Conquest, <a href="/deathmatch/3015-451/" data-ref-id="3015-451">Deathmatch</a>, Hero Deathmatch and <a href="/capture-the-flag/3015-25/" data-ref-id="3015-25">Capture the Ring</a>. There is <a href="/split-screen-event/3015-6211/" data-ref-id="3015-6211">split screen</a> and online co-op modes available for the campaigns. The online portion will allow for 16 players to battle-fight each other in the four multiplayer modes. There is basic conquest mode where you have to capture all the command points. Death Match is just a Team-based 'Kill everyone' mode. Hero Deathmatch is pretty much the same as Deathmatch, except everyone gets to use one of the Hero Characters. Capture the Ring is a take on Capture the Flag where both teams fight over the 'One Ring'.</p><p style="">Other Game modes that have been talked about are Ringbearer and Stronghold. In Ringbearer, one player plays as a Frodo and the remaining players as Nazgul. Frodo must stay alive and evade the Nazgul as long as possible. The Nazgul that kills Frodo becomes the new Frodo. Stronghold is similar to Star Wars: Battlefront's Galactic Conquest mode. Neither mode made it into the full game. Players are allowed to control large creatures like <a href="/trolls/3015-1446/" data-ref-id="3015-1446">Trolls</a> for Saurons forces and <a href="/treants/3015-4868/" data-ref-id="3015-4868">Ents</a> for the Free Peoples.</p><h2>Characters</h2><p style="">Like <a href="/star-wars-battlefront-ii/3030-7094/" data-ref-id="3030-7094">Star Wars: Battlefront II</a> before it, Conquest features powerful hero characters for both the good and evil sides of the conflict. Fan favorites such as Aragorn, <a href="/legolas/3005-2291/" data-ref-id="3005-2291">Legolas</a> and Gimli are included, as well as powerful evil hero characters such as the <a href="/balrog/3005-9165/" data-ref-id="3005-9165">Balrog</a>, <a href="/saruman/3005-6619/" data-ref-id="3005-6619">Saruman</a> and Sauron himself. The various heroes are essentially a more powerful version of one of the existing classes, for example, Aragorn is an upgraded Warrior and Frodo behaves like a Scout.</p><h3>Good Hero Characters:</h3><ol><li><a href="/aragorn/3005-2280/" data-ref-id="3005-2280">Aragorn</a></li><li><a href="/legolas/3005-2291/" data-ref-id="3005-2291">Legolas</a></li><li><a href="/gimli/3005-1638/" data-ref-id="3005-1638">Gimli</a></li><li><a href="/gandalf/3005-1535/" data-ref-id="3005-1535">Gandalf</a></li><li><a href="/elrond/3005-3802/" data-ref-id="3005-3802">Elrond</a></li><li><a href="/isildur/3005-9764/" data-ref-id="3005-9764">Isildur</a></li><li><a href="/faramir/3005-9188/" data-ref-id="3005-9188">Faramir</a></li><li><a href="/eowyn/3005-9186/" data-ref-id="3005-9186">Eowyn</a></li><li><a href="/frodo-baggins/3005-1546/" data-ref-id="3005-1546">Frodo</a></li></ol><h3>Evil Hero Characters:</h3><ol><li><a href="/balrog/3005-9165/" data-ref-id="3005-9165">Balrog</a></li><li>Gothmog</li><li><a href="/lurtz/3005-9183/" data-ref-id="3005-9183">Lurtz</a></li><li>Mouth of Sauron</li><li><a href="/nazgul/3015-6049/" data-ref-id="3015-6049">Nazgul</a></li><li><a href="/saruman/3005-6619/" data-ref-id="3005-6619">Saruman</a></li><li><a href="/sauron/3005-1856/" data-ref-id="3005-1856">Sauron</a></li><li><a href="/witch-king-of-angmar/3005-4546/" data-ref-id="3005-4546">Witch-King</a></li><li>Wormtongue</li></ol><h2>Classes</h2><p style="">Each class has one unique style from a possible five - <a href="/melee/3015-444/" data-ref-id="3015-444">Melee</a>, <a href="/projectiles/3015-3/" data-ref-id="3015-3">ranged</a>, <a href="/stealth/3015-24/" data-ref-id="3015-24">stealth</a> and <a href="/magic/3015-98/" data-ref-id="3015-98">magic</a>.</p><p style=""><b>Warrior:</b> Primarily a melee based combat unit that uses swordplay.

The focus this time around is on enhanced multiplayer and a realistic plane damage system.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Heroes Over Europe is a World War II flight sim developed by Transmission Games (formerly called IR Gurus). The game is a sequel to 2005's cult hit Heroes of the Pacific. The game's core mechanics will remain the same as Heroes of the Pacific, beside the natural refinements that the team has made. The campaign takes places over Europe this time, and you will take part in missions like defending the White Cliffs of Dover from German bombers, high altitude bombing runs, and dropping tank busters in the rugged and snowy Ardennes. The main difference this time will be the authenticity of the game which can easily be seen in its damage system.</p><p style="">Each plane is painstakingly modeled to make bullets have realistic effects when they hit certain parts of the plane. You will see tracers ripping holes through airfoils, if your wings ammo box is hit then it will ignite and most likely blow your wing off, and a hit to your fuel tank is one example of what the team is calling 'Ace Kill'. An Ace Kill is accomplished whenever bullets come into direct contact with the engine, fuel tank (which will instantly cause the plane to explode), or the pilot and will result in a one-hit kill.</p><p style="">Transmission Games is working hard to make this the most realistic World War II flight sim on the market. They have been able to access many kill clips taken by gun-mounted cameras from planes during World War II and have used the data to make sure you get as close of an experience to the real Heroes Over Europe as possible. They have even sent their sound engineer up in a restored P-51 Mustang to take sound clips while the Mustang was performing evasive dogfight maneuvers like barrel rolls to get authentic engine sounds. Multiplayer is also a large focus in the sequel. The most significant new mode is called Conquest. In Conquest, bombers and fighters will have to work together in tandem to destroy the enemy bases. Multiplayer supports 16 players and still has classic modes like Dogfight and Team Dogfight (essentially Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch).

Two major powers exist in this alternate world: the Atlantic Federation in the West controls most of the Europan peninsula, and the East Europan Alliance, known simply as 'the Empire", controls the East. Sitting in between both of these superpowers is the small nation of <a href="/gallia/3035-3295/" data-ref-id="3035-3295">Gallia</a>, home to an ancient bloodline, simple people, and a major reserve of ragnite ore. Ragnite is a miraculous ore that is used for many things, from powering vehicle and tank engines to providing Ragnaid's restorative powers. As the news of dwindling ragnite sources becomes a concern, the Empire launches a full invasion of the Atlantic Federation with a focus on Gallia itself, ostensibly to secure its ragnite. With Gallia struggling against this blitzkrieg, the story focuses on the actions of Squad 7, under command of Lieutenant Welkin Gunther, son of a famous war hero and a would-be natural sciences teacher, and Sergeant Alicia Melchiott, a would-be baker. Both first met each other within the village of Bruhl and found themselves fighting beside each other on the day the Empire's forces ruthlessly attack the city.</p><p style="">Through several daring missions, Gallia's forces manage to drive the Empire back, forcing its army to regroup. It is also discovered that the motivation behind the Empire's attack is not because of ragnite but because of interest in an all-powerful weapon left behind by an ancient race called the Valkyrur, which he believes to be hidden within the walls of Gallia's capital. According to legend, the Valkyrur had come down from the north and had used their incredible powers to defeat the Darcsen people who are blamed for nearly destroying the continent centuries earlier in a terrible war. Many doubt the existence of the Valkyrur today and consider them only as legend, but it is soon revealed that one of the Empire's generals, Selvaria Bles, is of Valkyrian blood. Displaying supernatural powers on the battlefield such as deflecting a tank shell with her shield or destroying an entire regiment of tanks on her own, she quickly turns the early victory of the Gallian army into a near rout singlehandedly until it is revealed that Alicia Melchiott is also of Valkyrian blood.</p><p style="">After defeating Selvaria, Alicia has severe doubts about her new role. Prince Maximilian, the commander of the Empire's invasion of the West, tells Selvaria that she must use the Final Flame. Selvaria's devotion to the Prince, born out of his mercy to her when he had her taken away from the Imperial testing facility where they were using her as a guinea pig, is challenged when he asks her to make the ultimate sacrifice. Devoted to both her duty and her unrequited love for her Prince, she makes preparations for the end.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2488/219384-vc1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-219384" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2488/219384-vc1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-219384"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2488/219384-vc1.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2488/219384-vc1.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Alicia Melchiott</figcaption></figure><p style="">At the fortress of Ghirlandaio on the border of Gallia and the Empire, Squad 7 and the Atlantic Federation engage Imperial forces in a decisive battle to end the war. Selvaria returns and challenges Squad 7 and Alicia to a duel between her forces and theirs without the use of her powers. In this final confrontation, Selvaria is finally defeated but gives herself up honorably. She is treated well by Squad 7 when she is captured. Alicia asks Selvaria how she deals with being a Valkyrur to which Selvaria replies that she must find something to believe in. When the Gallian army's commander arrives and Selvaria speaks without turn, he has a soldier smash the back of her head with the butt of a rifle. Gasping in pain, she asks only one thing: that Squad 7 escort her men, the Imperial prisoners, back to Gallia. The general laughs and accedes her request.</p><p style="">Later, as the Gallian general gloats in what had been Prince Maximilian's war room as he sits on his throne, Selvaria asks how long it has been since Squad 7 had left. The general says that several hours had already passed. Selvaria smiles to herself and begins burning with a blue light, awakening the Valkyrur power within her as she breaks her chains. The general orders her shot and bullets tear into her, but Selvaria's devotion to the Prince and to her duty give her the strength to demonstrate her will to fulfill her role. With one final speech, she invokes the Final Flame, annihilating the fortress and most of the Gallian army that had occupied it. Squad 7 witness the destruction from miles away as bolts of power sear the landscape, leaving the same type of scars seen in the Barious Desert. Alicia is shaken by Selvaria's sacrifice and questions herself if that is what it means to be a Valkyrur.</p><p style="">Prince Maximilian suddenly launches an attack with a mobile fortress which is the equivalent of a land battleship. With nothing to stand against it and most of the Gallian army destroyed by Selvaria's sacrifice, Alicia is determined to sacrifice her own life in order to use her new found power to destroy it. After chasing her down, Welkin is able to convince Alicia that there is more of a reason to live and that her powers don't make her any different as he confesses his love for her. Realizing that her new family in Squad 7, along with Welkin's love, represent the only power that should matter, she relents her attack with this new found purpose.</p><p style="">After this revelation, the members of Squad 7 race back to the capital in an effort to stop the Prince.

With the weapon's destruction, the Prince confronts Squad 7 in a final battle. Fueled by super science and bearing mock Valkyrur weaponry, the Prince attempts to destroy the Squad but after a pitched battle, defeat him at last. In a climactic finish, Welkin and Alicia are rescued from the exploding battleship by a glider that Isara had built. The fate of each squad member is revealed as the credits roll along with a list of those that had survived and those that may have died. Afterwards, it is shown that Alicia and Welkin are now husband and wife and have a daughter, Isara, as life returns to normal.</p><p style="">Aside from the main story, the game is also notable for dealing with many mature subjects, which have parallels with the Second World War. Genocide, prejudice, and racism against the Darcsen people, recognizable in the game by their dark hair, is depicted among both Gallian and Imperial peoples. For example; within Squad 7, Rosie openly shows her hate towards Darcsens, in particular Isara, the team's tank pilot and Welkin's adopted half-sister.</p><h2>Battle System</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15434/768510-vcdlc_09.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-768510" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15434/768510-vcdlc_09.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-768510"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15434/768510-vcdlc_09.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15434/768510-vcdlc_09.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>How aiming looks.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Called "BLiTZ", for "Battle of Live Tactical Zones", Valkyria Chronicles combines real-time and turn-based tactical combat. Each side takes its action in separate phases. Individual units can be activated by using "Command Points" (CP), and different unit classes cost different amounts of command points to activate, with Infantry using up one point and tanks using up two. Once activated, the unit can freely move about the battlefield in real-time, using weapons and abilities. As the unit moves, it can come under suppressing fire from enemy positions. Damage on enemies can also be increased by targeting the head, using mortars and grenades to destroy their cover, or using appropriate counter-units.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/495/628803-valk.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-628803" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/495/628803-valk.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-628803"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/495/628803-valk.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/495/628803-valk.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Planning the next move.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Units also have special abilities and traits called "Potentials" that affect their battlefield performance. For example, a unit with the "Child of Nature" potential feels uncomfortable operating on paved roads, lowering their accuracy, while a "Maternal" unit feels the need to protect her family, making her more effective when near units she has a close relationship with. Units also have relationships with other units, which can affect combination attacks, potential activation, and other factors. Commanders can also issue special orders, which can be specialized attacks or temporary boosts to unit attributes or performance.</p><p style="">Some unit classes are more effective against other unit types.</p><h3>The Classes</h3><h3 style="margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;">Scouts</h3><p style="">Scouts are the most agile soldier class in the game and their superior eyesight also lets them spot enemies hidden in tall grass from afar. Equipped with a standard caliber rifle, they lack the means to face enemy combat forces head on, but their high stamina can make the scout a valid flanking option. As a secondary weapon, the scout is equipped with a grenade and upgrading him or her to elite status will unlock a grenade launcher attachment.</p><h3 style="margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;">Shocktroopers</h3><p style="">The standard soldier unit armed with a high-power machine gun, ideal for taking on any type of foot soldiers from up close. They are good all-around units with no obvious weaknesses, but lack any specialties and are less mobile than the scout class. Shocktroopers also carry a grenade. Upon reaching elite status, they gain a flamethrower ideally used in close quarters, capable of hitting multiple enemies in close proximity with one action or bypassing cover to hit a defending enemy.</p><h3 style="margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;">Lancers</h3><p style="">This class is designed to damage tanks and armored vehicles with their large rocket-tipped lances, and also have enough defense to withstand the heavy blast attacks from mortars and tank rounds. Their low mobility and limited ammo renders them vulnerable to infantry attacks.</p><h3 style="margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;">Engineers</h3><p style="">Impractical in front line combat, as they have low offensive and defensive capabilities, Engineers are best suited to the support role. The ability to restore ammo, remove land mines, fix sandbags and sniper towers, repair tanks and on top of that having a respectable mobility fills that role well.</p><h3 style="margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;">Snipers</h3><p style="">Equipped with long-range rifles, snipers can easily take down enemy soldiers from a considerable distance. But low defensive capability and limited mobility weakens this class when facing multiple foes.</p><h3 style="margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;">Tanks</h3><p style="">These are equipped with highly destructive firepower, and they boast armor that shrugs off attacks from normal infantry - only lancers, other tanks, and special anti-tank cannons can damage them in head-on combat. To prevent overheating, however, tanks have an unarmored radiator in their rear, which is vulnerable to attacks of all kinds. These vehicles can also run over obstacles, such as sandbags or trees. The Tanks have two sections, the body and the tread. If the body is severely damaged the tank will be destroyed, while if the tread is destroyed the tank will survive but will suffer from a decrease in its mobility. Tanks are equipped with multiple weapons, including machine guns, anti-armor rounds, and wide area of effect mortars. The protagonist's primary tank is the <i>Edelweiss</i>, an experimental high-mobility unit developed during the First Europan War. Tanks can be upgraded in the hangar by attaching special equipment or attribute-boosting parts.</p><h3 style="margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;">Medics (not playable)</h3><p style="">When a unit's HP reaches zero it will remain on the ground. If the unit remains there for three turns, or if an enemy touches them they will become completely incapacitated and be permanently removed from the game. As friendly units approach a downed ally, or upon an order from Welkin, a medic can be called, evacuating the unit from battle to fight again later.</p><h2>Crossover Characters</h2><p style="">As a crossover feature, Valkyria Chronicles includes two playable characters from Sega's <a href="/skies-of-arcadia/3030-1609/" data-ref-id="3030-1609">Skies of Arcadia</a>, originally released on the <a href="/dreamcast/3045-37/" data-ref-id="3045-37">Dreamcast</a>. The game's main protagonist, <a href="/vyse/3005-2668/" data-ref-id="3005-2668">Vyse</a>, takes the role of a Shocktrooper while his childhood friend <a href="/aika/3005-3263/" data-ref-id="3005-3263">Aika</a> is depicted as a Scout. <a href="/fina/3005-3264/" data-ref-id="3005-3264">Fina</a> is also present, albeit in unplayable form, as the Medic. At the end of the game, it is revealed that both Vyse and Aika had left in search of adventure and that Fina and her sisters joined them.</p><h2>Characters</h2><h3>Main Characters</h3><h4><b><a href="/welkin-gunther/3005-8985/" data-ref-id="3005-8985">Welkin Gunther</a></b> - Leader of Squad 7</h4><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2488/219401-vc2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-219401" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2488/219401-vc2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-219401"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2488/219401-vc2.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2488/219401-vc2.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Son of the late War-Hero Belgen Gunther. He loves nature and is studying Natural Science at university at the start of the game. Welkin hopes to be a teacher some day so that he may pass his knowledge on to the younger generations. When he first returns back to Bruhl, his hometown, he is arrested by Alica who accuses him of being an imperial spy. He uses the Edelweiss, his late father's tank, during combat. After holding the imperials off long enough, he allows the residents of Bruhl to escape. He and Alicia themselves then escape to Randgriz, capital of Gallia. There, Welkin sings up for the Gallian militia. He is appointed Squad Leader due to his exploits in Bruhl. During certain missions when he is not using the tank, Welkin is a scout unit. For a squad leader he is considered young. Initially his squad members are skeptical of his leadership abilities, but after demonstrating his military genius, combined with his extensive knowledge of nature, he formulates a plan to drive his tank across a river and launch a surprise attack on the enemies camp. After this, the squad's members don't question him and soon develop a liking to him. As the game progresses, he soon brings all of the squad members together, to the point where they start to consider each other as family. He is also awarded the Gallian medal of Honour due to his numerous successes in battle.

Throughout the story, there are several clues of her bloodline, but only Faldio, Sqaud 1's leader, notices them. He conducts his own research and concludes that Alicia is a descendant of the Valkyrur. During the battle of Naggiar, Alicia's powers awaken after suffering a grave wound. After this revelation, she becomes unsure of her role as a Valkyria, and even contemplates sacrificing her life in order to give the Gallians victory in the War. She is dissuaded by Welkin, who vows to protect her. Welkin then proposes to her in the middle of the combat zone, to which Alicia accepts.</p><h4><b><a href="/isara-gunther/3005-8992/" data-ref-id="3005-8992">Isara Gunther</a></b> - Welkin's adopted sister</h4><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1550/255890-00230298.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-255890" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.52851711026616" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:52.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1550/255890-00230298.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-255890"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1550/255890-00230298.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1550/255890-00230298.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Her biological father was a good friend of Welkin's father, Belgen Gunther, and as a personal favour built the Edelweiss for Belgen. After her father passes away, Belgen adopts Isara as his own daughter. Isara runs and fixes the Edelweiss. In combat, she is the tank driver of the Edelweiss. Because she is a Darcsen (a certain race of people in the game's world), she is discriminated against. However, Welkin always comes in to defend his sister. Because of this, Isara vows to repay Welkin, and she decides to do this by building him an airplane, so that he may fly. During the game's time period, only a couple of other planes exist. She and Rosie initially fight, due to Rosie hating Darcsens at first. However, after Rosie witnesses the genocide and slavery of the Darcsen people, she realizes how inhuman she was being. Isara and Rosie then become friends. However, this is short lived. During the Battle at Marberry Shore, Isara is shot and killed. She is not forgotten however, as all the members of squad 7 (except Welkin as they decide to surprise him) begin to help out in realizing Isara's dream in building Welkin an airplane. The plane is finished near the end of the game, and it saves Welkin and Alicia's life.</p><h4><b><a href="/brigitte-rosie-stark/3005-8990/" data-ref-id="3005-8990">Brigitte "Rosie" Stark</a></b> - Former bar singer, which gained her the name "Rosie"</h4><figure data-ref-id="1300-2698044" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/8/82063/2698044-rosie_profile.jpg" data-size="small" data-align="right" data-ratio="0.89489489489489" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:89.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/8/82063/2698044-rosie_profile.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2698044"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2698044-rosie_profile.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2698044-rosie_profile.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">She can handle a gun, which led to her being the lead shocktrooper.

She becomes close friends with Isara eventually. It is revealed in a side chapter that her hate of the Darcsens originated when the Empire attacked her village because there was a large number of Darcsens living there. During the attack, her family is killed. However, after Isara is killed, she vows to do her part in stopping the Darcsen hating.

He also has a prejudice against Darcsens, but this quickly disappears after working closely with Isara. He is the lead lancer of Squad 7. Before joining the military, he lived on a farm that was owned by his parents. It's because of this that he has a great love for vegetables. He always reminds the squad to eat vegetables whenever they can because he claims that they are "bombs full of nutrients".He signed up for the militia during the first Europan War along with his friend Frederick. That's where they met Eleanor Varrot. Eleanor and Frederick fell for each other. However, during the war Frederick was captured, tortured, and killed. Varrot remains in the militia after the war, hoping for revenge against the enemy captain responsible. Largo decides to stay as well to can keep an eye on her. He manages to comfort Eleanor when she is given the chance to avenge Frederick and convinces her to let go of her hate.

He has three generals that serve under him called Drei Stern. He rescued Selvaria from a lab where they were conducting experiments on her, which causes Selvaria to develop an undying love and loyalty for Maximilian. At first it seems that he only wants to invade Gallia because of its abundance in Ragnite, but it is later revealed that he only wishes to claim the power of the Valkyrur for himself by collecting several artifacts based in Gallia and Randgriz, Gallia's Capital. He admits that he lusts for power because he aims to seize the empire for himself. Since his mother was not a royal, he was often shunned by his relatives. Consequently, he swears to have his vengeance and to gain control of the Empire.</p><h3><a href="/selvaria-bles/3005-10397/" data-ref-id="3005-10397">Selvaria Bles</a> - Part of the Drei Stern</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15434/546667-vb05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-546667" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.562" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15434/546667-vb05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-546667"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15434/546667-vb05.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15434/546667-vb05.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">She serves Maximilian with great loyalty. She has the unique powers of the Valkyrur. She awakens her power by wielding a spear and shield that the Valkyrur used in their time. Because of this, she is unstoppable in battle, even being able to reflect a tank shell with her Spear. She has a few childhood memories and remembers her mother's cooking fondly. Her mother was killed in some sort of attack, leaving Selvaria by herself. She is rescued by the Empire. However, after they realize her powers, she is taking to a lab in order to be experimented on. Maximillian saves her from the lab. This causes Selvaria to have an undying loyalty for him, to the point where she will give her life to realize his plans. She is also a proven commander and is in charge of the invasion of Central Gallia. She faces of against Squad 7 a total of three times. The first two times, she is invulnerable, but she can be forced to retreat by completing the mission's objective. She faces Squad 7 one last time at the fortress of Ghirlandaio, without her powers, and just as a normal woman. Squad 7 defeats her and she is taken prisoner by the Gallian army. As the militia leaves the fortress to escort the other imperial prisoners away, she uses the Valkyrur's final flame, sacrificing her life to wipe out the entirety of Gallia's army in a massive explosion. This gives Maximillian the opening to attack Randgriz directly.</p><h3><a href="/berthold-gregor/3005-14929/" data-ref-id="3005-14929">Berthold Gregor</a> - The oldest of the Drei Stern</h3><figure data-ref-id="1300-2698048" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/8/82063/2698048-berthold_gregor_profile.jpg" data-size="small" data-align="right" data-ratio="0.75849056603774" data-width="265" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 265px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/8/82063/2698048-berthold_gregor_profile.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2698048"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2698048-berthold_gregor_profile.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2698048-berthold_gregor_profile.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">He also led the invasion of Fhirald, another Europan county. There, he had a face of with Fhirald's top general, Radi Jaeger. Gregor's leg was injured in this battle, and so he walks with a walking stick. Gregor is placed in charge of the Northern invasion of Gallia and captures Fouzen, Gallia's biggest industrial city. There he has a Darcsen work camp, analogous to real-life Nazi concentration camps. He runs the camp with a clear hate for Darcsens, and subjects them to toxic working conditions without pity. Gregor maintains order and defends the camp with an armored train, heavily armed and impervious to assault. It rides a railway that circles Fouzen from above, so that it may shoot down any opponent. The train also has long-range mortars. However, the train is defeated when Squad 7 detonate the railway bridge that the train is riding on, causing it to fall into the river valley and blow up, with Gregor in it.</p><h3><a href="/radi-jaeger/3005-14928/" data-ref-id="3005-14928">Radi Jaeger</a> - The last member of the Drei Stern</h3><figure data-ref-id="1300-2698050" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/8/82063/2698050-1339803-282px_eps_valkyria_radiyaeger.jpg" data-size="small" data-align="right" data-ratio="1" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/8/82063/2698050-1339803-282px_eps_valkyria_radiyaeger.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2698050"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2698050-1339803-282px_eps_valkyria_radiyaeger.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2698050-1339803-282px_eps_valkyria_radiyaeger.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">He is not from the Empire, but from another country called Fhirald. He managed to fight off the Empire for a long time, even though his army was smaller and less well equipped. He was eventually defeated. However, Maximilian was so impressed that he gave Jaeger a proposition. He asked him to fight for the Empire and be one of his generals, and when the Empire has seized Gallia, Maximilian will give back Fhirald's independence. He fights with chivalry, and likes when his enemies do the same. He shows respect to everyone he meets, and also shows respect for his enemies. He is in charge of the Empire's tank division and is said to have won his battles by using "Advanced Tank Tactics". He drives a very powerful tank called Lupus Regnum, that has an outer armor shell. He is placed in charge of the Southern invasion of Gallia. Near the end of the game, Squad 7 faces off with Jaeger. Jaeger is defeated and his tank destroyed. He congratulates Squad 7 and resigns from the Imperial army, having recognized the strength of the squad's will to fight for their homeland as he fought for his.</p><h2>PC System

Taking place in the near future, players control <a href="/michael-thorton/3005-2474/" data-ref-id="3005-2474">Michael Thorton</a>, a secret agent for a top-secret United States governmental program known as Alpha Protocol. When things take a turn for the worse during a mission in Saudi Arabia, Thorton (considered rogue by the program) must travel the world to uncover an international conspiracy involving <a href="/halbech-corporation/3015-6796/" data-ref-id="3015-6796">Halbech Corporation</a>, a massive United States defense contractor with a shady goal.</p><p style="">Thorton can handle most situations in different ways, from sneaking covertly like a <a href="/spies/3015-1238/" data-ref-id="3015-1238">spy</a> to blazing guns like a <a href="/soldier/3015-2958/" data-ref-id="3015-2958">soldier</a>. He can also use special technical gadgets, such as <a href="/proximity-mines/3055-1309/" data-ref-id="3055-1309">proximity mines</a> and portable <a href="/radar-jammer/3055-1225/" data-ref-id="3055-1225">radar jammers</a>, to subdue enemies or calm an alarming situation.</p><p style="">Similar to the <a href="/mass-effect/3025-560/" data-ref-id="3025-560">Mass Effect</a> series, many of the conversations and scenes can have multiple outcomes based on the player's choice. Anytime in conversations, players have limited time to choose to act professional (similar to <a href="/jason-bourne/3005-2397/" data-ref-id="3005-2397">Jason Bourne</a>), aggressive (similar to <a href="/jack-bauer/3005-1181/" data-ref-id="3005-1181">Jack Bauer</a>), or suave (similar to <a href="/james-bond/3005-238/" data-ref-id="3005-238">James Bond</a>). These choices can often influence positively or negatively to whoever he's talking to. These reputations, along with certain choices Thorton make throughout the game (such as executing, sparing, or arresting particular foes, or performing certain actions in earlier missions), can directly impact missions and the endgame (sometimes unlocking special information about people).</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Structure</h3><p style="">After the opening tutorial and training sessions at the Alpha Protocol agency, missions are given, which are grouped by location. Thorton's initial batch of assignments are in <a href="../../saudi-arabia/95-1612/" rel="nofollow">Saudi Arabia</a>. After completing the area, three more sets of missions are made available to Thorton in Moscow, Rome, and Taipei, which can be tackled in any order, before the final arc of the story. Each location sees Thorton stay at a luxurious safe house, where he can check his e-mail, buy new weapons from the Clearinghouse system, or customize his appearance before the start of a mission.</p><h3>Combat</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/2367312-apgame_2012_11_06_21_47_22_64.png" data-ref-id="1300-2367312" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/2367312-apgame_2012_11_06_21_47_22_64.png" data-ref-id="1300-2367312"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/81005/2367312-apgame_2012_11_06_21_47_22_64.png"></a><figcaption>Shooting in Saudi Arabia.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Thorton is controlled from an over-the-shoulder third-person perspective. Like most shooters, aiming down the sight provides greater accuracy. When aiming, a circle appears indicating how far off the center the shot may go. With pistols and assault rifles, a reticule is displayed when charging for a critical hit. When fully charged, the shot is guaranteed to hit the center. Thorton carries two weapons and up to several types of <a href="../../gadgets/92-1379/" rel="nofollow">gadgets</a>. Trained in the fighting art of Kenpo, he can engage in close-quarters combat if need be, while he can also take cover behind most solid objects and blind-fire, though blind-firing is considerably more inaccurate unless the shot is a critical hit.</p><p style="">Health is measured in two ways -- an endurance bar and a health bar. Damage is first dealt to endurance. When endurance is empty, damage harms the health bar. Endurance regenerates after a short wait when no hits are taken, but health does not, and must be replenished via first-aid boxes lying around during missions or first-aid kits, which can be carried around among the gadgets. Thorton dies when all of his health is gone. When an enemy is alert to Thorton's presence (the Awareness indicator will turn red), there is a high chance he will set off an alarm that makes the guards aggressively look for Thorton. The alarm must be deactivated if he wishes to switch to stealth. If an enemy spots someone dead or incapacitated or suspects someone is loitering around (the Awareness indicator will turn yellow), he will investigate and start looking around.</p><h3>Skills and Abilities</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/2367344-apgame_2012_11_09_19_45_03_01.png" data-ref-id="1300-2367344" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/2367344-apgame_2012_11_09_19_45_03_01.png" data-ref-id="1300-2367344"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/81005/2367344-apgame_2012_11_09_19_45_03_01.png"></a><figcaption>Players can give Thorton a boost in certain skills and grant him new abilities.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Throughout the game, players can increase Thorton's skills in various categories (including specific weaponry, stealth, toughness, technical aptitude, and martial arts), granting him bonuses and new active abilities. These skills are upgraded via Advancement Points (AP), which is earned by gaining levels (10 AP per level) and getting certain perks.</p><p style="">Thorton starts at Level 1 with 30 AP (0 AP with the Recruit background type and 120 AP with the Veteran background type), and gain new levels by reaching certain experience milestones.

When Thorton interacts with another character, he can take up one of (usually) three stances when responding. These three common stances are "professional", a by-the-book attitude, "suave", a more relaxed stance that sees Thorton smooth-talk, and "aggressive", where Thorton likes to get straight to the point without worrying about what anyone else thinks. Obsidian has likened these to the personalities of three fictional spies, the "three J.B."s: <a href="../../jason-bourne/94-2397/" rel="nofollow">Jason Bourne</a>, <a href="../../james-bond/94-238/" rel="nofollow">James Bond</a>, and <a href="../../jack-bauer/94-1181/" rel="nofollow">Jack Bauer</a> respectively. From time to time, a fourth stance is available. For example, Thorton may be given the option to draw his gun or attacking the person he's speaking to instead of continuing the conversation.</p><p style="">In all conversations, Thorton only has a few seconds to decide which stance to assume. Different characters react well and poorly to different responses, which is vital in determining whether they end up trusting or disliking Thorton. Each NPC has a number that indicates Thorton's reputation to them, ranging from -10 (animosity) to 10 (friendship). Reputation determines their attitude towards Thorton, and dialogue is often altered as a result of this. In some cases, having a certain reputation with a character opens up an extra option. Maybe they will offer a deal that they wouldn't normally make or welcome romantic advances. Another example sees an informant, if he doesn't trust Thorton, alert the local Embassy that he's in the city, resulting in extra armed men in a following mission. Having a negative reputation with a character is not necessarily a gameplay disadvantage however. All the mission handlers have a unique perk, only available by antagonising them and in the example above the the increased guard at the local embassy can be persuaded to work with Thorton, providing more backup than the lightly armed staff otherwise present.</p><h3>Choices and Consequences</h3><p style="">Throughout the game, Thorton is faced with plenty of key decisions that affect dialogue, alliances, reputation, and intel. In one example, by sparing a character, Thorton learns the real identity of the person responsible of a crime, and an additional mission is added to the city. These choices aren't necessarily moral decisions -- some are lose-lose situations where no matter what Thorton picks, a catastrophe is going to happen. The decisions made and reputation earnt plays a significant part in the story's finale, which has multiple endings and two possible different final boss fights, and allows for different fates for most of the major characters involved. In fact, all but one major character can be killed during the course of the game (one of the game's achievements requires Thorton to execute everyone possible in one playthrough).</p><h3>Equipment</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1112010-t_alphaprotocol_sdcc09_walkthrtr_pt2_hd_126.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1112010" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1112010-t_alphaprotocol_sdcc09_walkthrtr_pt2_hd_126.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1112010"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1112010-t_alphaprotocol_sdcc09_walkthrtr_pt2_hd_126.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1112010-t_alphaprotocol_sdcc09_walkthrtr_pt2_hd_126.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Modifying a pistol.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Weapons and armor are bought in the safe house before each mission and come with different stats.

Each is divided into several parts, and these are scattered across the game. They can be picked up on missions, purchased or given as intel, or added as Thorton learns through a conversation. Some are dependent on the decisions you make. Killing someone, for example, may mean you'll lose the chance to finish their dossier, while one mission gives Thorton the chance to blackmail someone for intel at the cost of losing a potential ally.</p><p style="">Acquiring a full dossier on a subject can be tricky, but can have certain benefits other than reading up on their background. Extra damage can be dealt to boss characters, and further dialogue options and -- at a few rare points in the game -- revelations can be given. There are 22 character and 13 faction dossiers to collect, though it is impossible to fully complete every single dossier in one playthrough. This is because during two e-mail correspondences with Mina Tang, Thorton can only request one person to be researched out of a group of three individuals.</p><h3>Customization</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1112156-t_alphaprotocol_sdcc09_walkthrtr_pt2_hd_023.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1112156" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1112156-t_alphaprotocol_sdcc09_walkthrtr_pt2_hd_023.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1112156"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1112156-t_alphaprotocol_sdcc09_walkthrtr_pt2_hd_023.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1112156-t_alphaprotocol_sdcc09_walkthrtr_pt2_hd_023.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>A bearded Thorton with shades.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Matt Rorie's Alpha Protocol offers little in terms of customizing Thorton's appearance. A few eye colors, hair styles, and facial hair styles are available to use, and Thorton can wear an assortment of eyewear and headwear. His name and gender cannot be altered.</p><h3>Romances</h3><p style="">Thorton can romance up to four women:</p><ul><li><a href="../../mina-tang/94-15566/" rel="nofollow">Mina Tang</a></li><li><a href="../../madison-saint-james/94-15569/" rel="nofollow">Madison Saint James</a></li><li><a href="../../scarlet-lake/94-15567/" rel="nofollow">Scarlet Lake</a></li><li><a href="../../sie/94-15568/" rel="nofollow">SIE</a></li></ul><p style="">There is only one opportunity to romance each one, during a specific conversation in the game.

Most of the game takes place in the past as protagonist <a href="/">Michael Thorton</a> and <a href="../../henry-leland/94-16085/" rel="nofollow">Henry Leland</a>, the boss of American defense contractor <a href="../../halbech-corporation/92-6796/" rel="nofollow">Halbech</a>, are discussing the events of the previous three months from Thorton's perspective, just before the start of the final mission.</p><p style="">Thorton is a new field agent for Alpha Protocol, a secret agency that must deny all links to the US government due to the nature of the covert operations it performs. After training, <a href="../../yancy-westridge/94-16086/" rel="nofollow">Yancy Westridge</a>, in charge of the program, assigns Thorton an assignment in Saudi Arabia: to find <a href="../../ali-shaheed/94-16090/" rel="nofollow">Ali Shaheed</a>, a core member of the anti-American terrorist group Al-Samad, and recover the remaining missiles; one was recently used to devastatingly shoot down an airplane. After confronting Shaheed, Thorton learns that Halbech supplied the missiles. Moments later, having survived a missile strike, he is cut off from Alpha Protocol. <a href="/">Mina Tang</a>, one of his handlers, tells him that there are people who are part of Alpha Protocol that also work for Halbech, and are trying to prevent Thorton from relaying what he learnt from Shaheed.</p><p style="">Thorton wants to report back to Alpha Protocol, but Mina says that would only end up in his capture. Alpha Protocol, distancing themselves from the operation, has branded him as a rogue agent; Thorton is now a wanted man. It becomes clear that Halbech are working with Alpha Protocol and using its resources to advance their plans to initiate a cold war for profit, but there is growing concern from Thorton and Mina that Halbech's projections are inaccurate and that they might actually incite a real war.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1970/211583-945400_20080716_screen006.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-211583" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1970/211583-945400_20080716_screen006.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-211583"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1970/211583-945400_20080716_screen006.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1970/211583-945400_20080716_screen006.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">With Mina's assistance, Thorton chases leads around the world to uncover the whole truth about Halbech and to stop them from causing international conflict. Moscow sees Thorton try to determine who's been dealing with Halbech and distributing the missiles, and possibly allies himself with faction G22, led by <a href="../../albatross/94-16091/" rel="nofollow">Albatross</a>, and <a href="/">SIE</a>. When trying to reach <a href="../../sergei-surkov/94-16096/" rel="nofollow">Sergei Surkov</a>, a businessman rumored to be collaborating with the Russian Mafia, he encounters resistance whose intention is to kill Surkov under Halbech's orders. Surkov tells him that <a href="../../konstantin-brayko/94-16097/" rel="nofollow">Konstantin Brayko</a> is responsible for the missiles, but as Thorton infiltrates Brayko's mansion, he can discover that Surkov may not have been entirely honest, and that he was previously working with Halbech.</p><p style="">Thorton initially investigates why an Al-Samad terrorist cell appears to have been activated in Rome, but <a href="../../conrad-marburg/94-16094/" rel="nofollow">Conrad Marburg</a>, Halbech's former Chief of Security, soon becomes his main focus. Marburg warns him to stay away, but Thorton ignores his threats and learns with help from Marburg's personal assistant <a href="/">Madison Saint James</a> that he plans to blow up the museum to harshen the anti-terrorist laws. However, Marburg kidnaps Madison, and gives him a choice: save Madison or deactivate the bombs.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14440/1449080-2b6ap2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1449080" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.764" data-width="250" style="width: 250px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:76.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14440/1449080-2b6ap2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1449080"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14440/1449080-2b6ap2.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14440/1449080-2b6ap2.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Thorton's objective in Taipei is to prevent the assassination of <a href="../../ronald-sung/94-16101/" rel="nofollow">President Ronald Sung</a>. The assassination would incite massive riots and raise significant tension between China and the US. Help from photojournalist <a href="../../scarlet-lake/94-15567/" rel="nofollow">Scarlet Lake</a>, local contact <a href="/">Steven Heck</a>, and Triad boss <a href="../../hong-shi/94-16099/" rel="nofollow">Hong Shi</a> leads Thorton to learn more about the plans as well as the mysterious <a href="../../omen-deng/94-16100/" rel="nofollow">Omen Deng</a>. Thorton retrieves a flash drive of both the assassination and riot plans, but a self-deleting mechanism forces him to choose to save the data of only one set of plans. Omen appears to be the one who's set to snipe Sung, but when Thorton defeats Omen in a fight, Sung is still shot. Depending on what data Thorton chose to save earlier, either Sung dies from the bullet to the chest or large numbers of casualties happen in the proceeding riots, with the rioters believing that their president is dead.</p><p style="">After Thorton has finished up in Moscow, Rome, and Taipei, he reflects to determine his next move. In a conversation with Mina, he learns that despite his best efforts, Halbech is still confident that a cold war will happen between China and the US, but it becomes increasingly likely that they'll start World War III instead. This inspires Thorton to act urgently, and prepares to give himself up to Alpha Protocol to be transported to their headquarters for a final showdown with both Halbech and Alpha Protocol. Before doing so, he possibly speaks to Scarlet (to give her incriminating evidence of Halbech's crimes that he's accumulated during his travels), Albatross, and Shaheed.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14440/1449081-sie.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1449081" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.48" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:48.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14440/1449081-sie.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1449081"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14440/1449081-sie.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14440/1449081-sie.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Now in the present day, Thorton and Leland finish off their conversation in Alpha Protocol's interrogation room. Leland can then offer Thorton the opportunity to work for Halbech, as long as Thorton agrees to take down Alpha Protocol and its key employees to remove any trace of Halbech's association with them. Held in the medical bay, Thorton relies on an ally to free him from his restraints, and encounters many of his former colleagues before a final confrontation with either Westridge or Leland. By this point, he may have discovered that Mina was the one who cut him off from Alpha Protocol back in Saudi Arabia (she claims only a rogue agent could take down Halbech and Alpha Protocol together) and that Scarlet was Sung's sniper (she had a freelance contract with Leland). How Thorton deals with them has a possible effect on the final scene.</p><p style="">After taking down the final boss and putting an end to Halbech or Alpha Protocol (or both), Thorton rides off on a speedboat towards the sunset, either by himself or with Mina, Scarlet, or Heck. If he earlier agreed to work for Leland, Thorton accepts a cigar from his new boss, and they hop onto the speedboat to get away from the ruined Alpha Protocol.</p><h2>PC System Requirements</h2><ul><li><b>OS</b>: Windows XP (Service Pack 2)</li><li><b>Processor</b>: 2.66 GHz Intel or Athlon XP 2400 AMD</li><li><b>Memory</b>: 2 GB RAM</li><li><b>Hard Drive</b>: 12 GB free space</li><li><b>Video Card</b>: DirectX 9.1, Pixel Shader 3.0, and 256 MB (e.g. GeForce 7900, ATI 1800)</li><li><b>Sound Card</b>: DirectX 9.1 compatible</li><li><b>Peripherals</b>: Keyboard, mouse</li></ul>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>20984</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/2261083-box_aprotocol.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/2261083-box_aprotocol.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/2261083-box_aprotocol.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/2261083-box_aprotocol.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/2261083-box_aprotocol.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2261083-box_aprotocol.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/2261083-box_aprotocol.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Alpha Protocol]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>41</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-16/]]></api_detail_url><id>16</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: M]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-5/]]></api_detail_url><id>5</id><name><![CDATA[BBFC: 15]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-12/]]></api_detail_url><id>12</id><name><![CDATA[OFLC: MA15+]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2010-05-27 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/alpha-protocol/3030-20984/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20986/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-07-09 11:49:42</date_added><date_last_updated>2012-12-05 22:02:49</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[Backbreaker is the debut game from NaturalMotion, developers of the Dynamic Motion Synthesis technology found in Euphoria.

The game has a high focus on tackles and a third-person camera angle similar to that in <a data-ref-id="3010-1" href="/electronic-arts/3010-1/" slug="electronic-arts">Electronic Arts</a>' <a data-ref-id="3030-20661" href="/skate-2/3030-20661/" slug="skate-2">Skate</a> series. Developers positioned the camera for gameplay in order to make the player feel like they're more a "part of the action", and less of a coach. Backbreaker was released on June 1, 2010. A demo was released a few weeks prior, on May 21.</p><p style="">Backbreaker also has a highly detailed and complex team creator, which has drawn comparisons to the customization abilities of the <a data-ref-id="3030-5881" href="/forza-motorsport-2/3030-5881/" slug="forza-motorsport-2">Forza Motorsport</a> series. The system allows you to create unique, non-NFL inspired teams, custom uniforms and more. Using this tool, many unofficial NFL rosters have been released for the game, with accurate players, teams, and respective statistics.</p><p style="">The game received moderate mixed reviews, with a current Metacritic rating in the mid 50's (54 for Xbox 360, 58 for Playstation 3). On June 25th, 2010, it was confirmed on the game's official forums that a major patch was in development. It was confirmed to fix many major issues and possibly feature additions requested by the community. The patch, titled the "Greathouse" patch, was released on August 4th, and <a data-ref-id="1100-2384" href="/natural-motion-fixing-tons-of-issues-in-backbreaker/1100-2384/" slug="natural-motion-fixing-tons-of-issues-in-backbreaker">addressed a wide range of issues</a>, including:</p><ul><li>Brand new replay system with the addition of seven fully functional cameras, including free flight mode and a cinematic ‘ball-lock’ option.</li><li>More than 100 new plays added, including an additional nine formations.</li><li>Improved Quarterback camera view and passing game.</li><li>A user-catch system, giving the player a much greater level of control over the on-field action.</li><li>Interception control, the user is now given full control over interception attempts when controlling a defensive player.</li><li>Comprehensive review of the penalty rulings following an analysis of reported errors.</li><li>Removal of P.O.D.'s "Boom" playing on each kickoff; the song now only plays on kickoffs respective to the beginning of the first and second halves of the game.</li><li>The signature of "Cougar Greathouse" on the game's title screen, a tongue-in-cheek joke from the developers with respect to many of the game's ridiculously named characters.</li></ul><p style="">On June 29, 2011, NaturalMotion released a pseudo sequel to Backbreaker on the Xbox Live Marketplace. <a data-ref-id="3030-35738" href="/backbreaker-vengeance/3030-35738/" slug="backbreaker-vengeance">Backbreaker: Vengeance</a> is a collection of mini-games meant to not only challenge the player, but further showcase the improvements of the Euphoria engine as it relates to sports games. The game was not regarded highly among reviewers and did not sell well as such; ultimately driving NaturalMotion out of development in the console market.</p><p style="">Backbreaker requires 1.1GB of free hard drive space to install to your Xbox 360 hard drive. This is a relatively small amount of space when compared to other Xbox 360 games.</p><h2>Euphoria</h2><p style="">Backbreaker is the first sports game that uses the Euphoria physics engine. This allowed the developers to simulate human movement in real time, offering more realistic animations than canned animations and making all the characters using Euphoria fully interactive. The developers used this to enhance the interactions between players. The use of this engine and it's variability has resulted in many YouTube videos showcasing physics errors, with players taking part in extremely violent collisions or making catches, runs and throws that would otherwise be regarded as superhuman.</p><p style="">Through its use in Backbreaker, the Euphoria engine proved itself to be effective in many aspects of football video games. Although not perfect, many tackles look realistic to what you might see during a football game in real life, as well as passes from the quarterback while being tackled or catches being made while the receiver is contacted by the defender. The majority of other football games would be forced to revert to a <a data-ref-id="3015-5983" href="/pre-rendered-movement/3015-5983/" slug="pre-rendered-movement">pre-rendered animation</a>, not allowing the quarterback to release the pass before falling to the ground, or likewise with the receiver making a catch.</p><p style="">Shortcomings of the Euphoria engine in a sports game were also showcased in Backbreaker. When there is a fumble in a crowded area of the field, NPCs will commonly crowd around the ball, all attempting to pick it up at the same time. This caused the physics engine to knock over many players, who then had contact with other players, creating a domino effect of players tripping or falling to the ground; all while the ball is still loose on the field. There are also difficulties between the regulations of the game of football, and the real-time physics engine. Players can often interfere with receivers to keep them from catching the ball without referees calling penalties. Kickers and Quarterbacks can also be contacted well after they have gotten rid of the ball (a major penalty against the defender who makes contact in all levels of football) without any repercussions.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">The game adds a challenge to football games which had not been seen since <a data-ref-id="3030-13056" href="/espn-nfl-2k5/3030-13056/" slug="espn-nfl-2k5">ESPN NFL 2K5</a>'s "First Person Football", forcing the player to control the actions of only one individual player at a time. Holding down the right trigger on a respective console, you'll go into "aggressive mode" where you can run into a group of <a data-ref-id="3015-967" href="/non-player-character/3015-967/" slug="non-player-character">NPC</a>s and stiff-arm them out of your way. However, while doing so, you'll have to use the A button (X on PS3) to switch hands in order to make sure the proper arm is not holding the ball, and free to block. Other football games such as <a data-ref-id="3025-491" href="/madden-nfl/3025-491/" slug="madden-nfl">Madden</a> automatically cause the player-controller character to complete such actions, without any additional user input. Other moves in Backbreaker include jukes, hurdles and spins. Backbreaker also puts a high emphasis on it's tackle system, which has no canned animations, instead using its complex <a data-ref-id="3015-704" href="/euphoria-engine/3015-704/" slug="euphoria-engine">Euphoria physics engine</a> to create <a data-ref-id="3015-3864" href="/real-time-over-pre-rendered-movies/3015-3864/" slug="real-time-over-pre-rendered-movies">real-time</a> collisions between players.</p><p style="">Backbreaker features a "Tackle Alley" mode, where players take on an open-field of defenders as a single running back. The goal of Tackle Alley is to reach the opposite end of the field without being tackled. Players can progress through a total of 100 different rounds, all increasing in difficulty through different arrangements of defenders, and presenting defenders with different abilities. Players can accumulate points through a number of avenues in-game. These include "jukes", shoulder "barges", and even dancing or "showboating" on-field. There are also certain "zones" on the field that are typically more challenging to reach, but reward the player with bonus points. <a data-ref-id="3015-30" href="/leaderboard/3015-30/" slug="leaderboard">Online leaderboards</a> are kept for point records.</p><h2>List of teams</h2><p style="">Note that all these teams are fictional and include no real players.</p><ul><li>Albuquerque Atoms</li><li>Anaheim Thrashers</li><li>Arizona Assassins</li><li>Atlanta Firebirds</li><li>Baltimore Cannons</li><li>Birmingham Irons</li><li>Boston Smugglers</li><li>Little Rock Maulers</li><li>Buffalo Beasts</li><li>Carolina Leopards</li><li>Charleston Cougars</li><li>Charlotte Yellowjackets</li><li>Chicago Talons</li><li>Cincinnati Hogs</li><li>Cleveland Kings</li><li>Colorado Six Shooters</li><li>Columbia Colonels</li><li>Columbus Blitz</li><li>Dallas Spectres</li><li>D.C.

The game features high quality graphics for a mobile game, and focuses on evading obstacles to reach the end zone. There are three difficulties, each featuring their own unique challenges and have a horde-like endurance mode where the player braves multiple waves of field challenges. This version was developed by Ideaworks game studio.</p><p style="">The game is played by tilting the device to move around. At the bottom of each side of the screen, you have your juke and spin buttons, as well as sprint and showboat. There are different areas of the endzone that net you different amounts of points. To get even more points, you're given the option to showboat after passing the last opponent. This can get you loads of points if you manage to hold it all the way to the endzone.</p><p style="">There are three difficulty modes: Rookie, Pro, and Hardcore. Each difficulty includes a challenge and endurance mode. In challenge mode, you must beat a challenge to unlock the next challenge level. The challenges basically ask you to complete a certain number of waves. According to your score, you get a helmet at the end of each challenge: bronze, silver, gold and the best and hardest one to get, the Backbreaker helmet. The game sports a Facebook feature that lets you share your scores with your friends. Endurance pits you against endless waves of enemies.</p><p style="">At the beginning of the game, the player can customize his character. He can give him a name that is shown on the back of his jersey, select a number for him, define his skin tone and give him a team.</p><p style="">The mobile games were so successful for NaturalMotion that in 2011 the company announced they would no longer be developing games for consoles such as the Xbox 360 or Playstation 3; and would solely focus development on games for mobile platforms.</p><p style="">An HD version of the Backbreaker mobile game was released for the iPad on April 2, 2010.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>20986</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/1887865-box_bbreaker.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/1887865-box_bbreaker.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/1887865-box_bbreaker.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/1887865-box_bbreaker.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/1887865-box_bbreaker.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1887865-box_bbreaker.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/1887865-box_bbreaker.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Backbreaker]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>2</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-6/]]></api_detail_url><id>6</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: E]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-14/]]></api_detail_url><id>14</id><name><![CDATA[OFLC: G]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2010-06-01 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-96/]]></api_detail_url><id>96</id><name><![CDATA[iPhone]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/iphone/3045-96/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[IPHN]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-121/]]></api_detail_url><id>121</id><name><![CDATA[iPad]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/ipad/3045-121/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[IPAD]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-123/]]></api_detail_url><id>123</id><name><![CDATA[Android]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/android/3045-123/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[ANDR]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/backbreaker/3030-20986/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20987/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-07-09 12:01:39</date_added><date_last_updated>2013-02-27 19:32:24</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[Both a remake and expansion to the critically-acclaimed Xbox and PC title The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay, Dark Athena features both the original campaign, an all-new campaign and new multiplayer modes.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/963084-shinyhead.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-963084" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.48125" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:48.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/963084-shinyhead.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-963084"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5911/963084-shinyhead.jpg"></a><figcaption>Vin Diesel provides his likeness for this game.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena is a <a href="/remake/3015-340/" data-ref-id="3015-340">remake</a> of the critically-acclaimed Xbox game <a href="/the-chronicles-of-riddick-escape-from-butcher-bay/3030-11085/" data-ref-id="3030-11085">Chronicles of Riddick: Escape From Butcher Bay</a>, developed by <a href="/starbreeze-studios-ab/3010-1768/" data-ref-id="3010-1768">Starbreeze Studios</a>. The game features the entire <a href="/the-chronicles-of-riddick-escape-from-butcher-bay/3030-11085/" data-ref-id="3030-11085">Escape From Butcher Bay</a> campaign(which has been improved from the original <a href="/xbox/3045-32/" data-ref-id="3045-32">Xbox</a> version), which can be selected when starting a new game. It isn't required to play through the <a href="/butcher-bay/3035-577/" data-ref-id="3035-577">Butcher Bay</a> portion of the game in order to access the new campaign, Dark Athena.</p><p style="">The game puts you in the shoes of Riddick, a deadly fugitive who is wanted by every prison and every bounty hunter in the galaxy. The only problem is keeping him locked up. Butcher Bay and it's expansion Dark Athena take you through the seedy world of the Butcher Bay jail, aboard the merc ship <a href="/dark-athena/3035-2362/" data-ref-id="3035-2362">Dark Athena</a> and across the world of Aguerra where you'll hack, slash and snap the necks of every no good in-mate, guard and solider who gets in your way of freedom.

One of the most important differences is removing the DNA restricted weapons . Though early on in the Dark Athena campaign the player must rely on <a href="/melee/3015-444/" data-ref-id="3015-444">melee</a> or picking up guns attached to the clone enemies.Then, at a certain point weapons can then be picked up and used unlike the first game which required a DNA input.</p><p style="">The weaponry list (both <a href="/projectile/3015-3/" data-ref-id="3015-3">projectile</a> and <a href="/melee/3015-444/" data-ref-id="3015-444">melee</a>) has also expanded and the player has access to a significantly more sophisticated arsenal . Assault on Dark Athena is somewhat less linear than Escape From Butcher Bay. Though the game includes much more shooting action than Butcher Bay which had a more significant amount of <a href="/stealth/3015-24/" data-ref-id="3015-24">stealth</a>.</p><h2>Multiplayer</h2><h3>Team Deathmatch</h3><p style="">This a standard <a href="/team-deathmatch/3015-2463/" data-ref-id="3015-2463">Team Deathmatch</a></p><h3>Pitch Black</h3><p style="">Named after the first movie featuring Richard Riddick, this mode is similar to the 'Juggernaut' mode in the <a href="/halo/3025-2/" data-ref-id="3025-2">Halo series</a>. In this mode, the map has very little light, most of the players are guards while one is Riddick. Guards are equipped with guns and <a href="/flashlight/3055-156/" data-ref-id="3055-156">flashlights</a> of limited effectiveness, while Riddick is armed with his Ulak blades and can use his Eyeshine ability. Guards must work together to take Riddick down, while he attempts to kill as many guards as he can. If a guard kills Riddick, he immediately respawns <i>as</i> Riddick.</p><h3>Arena</h3><p style="">Arena is a one-on-one or two-on-two elimination matches inside a small, contained map, with the other players spectating until it's their turn to throw down.</p><h3>Butcher Bay Riot</h3><p style="">Similar to <a href="/counter-strike/3025-114/" data-ref-id="3025-114">Counter-Strike</a> in that you have a currency at the start of the game to buy weapons, armor and ammo. However the main game is a 3 way fight between Prisoners, Mercenaries and Guards. There is one power-node in the middle the objective is to get the node into your opponents base and each team will have a certain team's base they have to get the node into, for example, Prisoners will have to get the node into the Guards' base the Guards will be after the Mercenaries and the Mercenaries will be after the Prisoners.</p><h2>Trivia</h2><ul><li>The developer team has claimed that Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena is a profoundly long story-driven <a href="/first-person-perspective/3015-330/" data-ref-id="3015-330">first person</a> shooter. Finishing the single player campaign can take somewhere around 20-25 hours.</li></ul><ul><li>The world of Dark Athena is deliberately rude and provocative . Due to <a href="/stealth/3015-24/" data-ref-id="3015-24">stealth</a> nature of the game player can witness or hear assorted things ranging from overhearing conversations on soldier's sexual habits to finding pornography lying around, to supposedly interrupting masturbating guards. The game also features strong language and profanity. The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena is rated M for mature.</li></ul><h2>Demo</h2><p style="">There is a playable demo, available now, on the <a href="/xbox-live/3015-1404/"

Darksiders is <a href="/vigil-games/3010-6304/" data-ref-id="3010-6304">Vigil Games</a>' debut title, and is published by <a href="/thq/3010-15/" data-ref-id="3010-15">THQ</a> (in North America and Europe) and <a href="/konami-corporation/3010-87/" data-ref-id="3010-87">Konami</a> (in Japan). The game is loosely based on the book of Revelations in the Bible. Vigil took the concepts of the <a href="/horsemen-of-the-apocalypse/3015-4533/" data-ref-id="3015-4533">Four Horsemen</a>, the Apocalypse, Heaven and Hell, Angels and Demons, among other references, and created their own take and mythology on them.</p><p style="">Darksiders tells the story of <a href="/war/3005-997/" data-ref-id="3005-997">War</a>, one of the Four Horsemen who is blamed for the destruction of humanity in a premature battle between Heaven and Hell. The game sold well, estimated at 1.2 million units worldwide in the four weeks after release. Its success has led not only to a <a href="/darksiders-ii/3030-29941/" data-ref-id="3030-29941">sequel</a>, but also a planned film adaptation being written by Darksiders creator <a href="/joe-madureira/3040-27284/" data-ref-id="3040-27284">Joe Madureira</a>.</p><p style="">The game received generally positive reviews. It obtained 83% on Gamerankings on both console platforms and 82% on PC; whilst on Metacritic the game obtained 82% on PS3 and 83% on both the PC and Xbox 360 platforms. Critics lauded the game for being the "dark <a href="/the-legend-of-zelda/3025-9/" data-ref-id="3025-9">Zelda</a>" that <a href="/nintendo/3010-90/" data-ref-id="3010-90">Nintendo</a> will never make; praising the voice acting, combat, environments, and puzzle design.</p><p style="">Notably, the Watcher is voiced by <a href="../../mark-hamill/72-3248/" rel="nofollow">Mark Hamill</a>. Additionally of note is the initial screen tearing issue that the Xbox 360 version suffered from (now fixed via a patch). Because of this, and minor framerate issues, the PlayStation 3 version had a <i>slightly</i> better initial reception.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14440/1441036-darksiders_01_lg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1441036" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.59" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:59.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14440/1441036-darksiders_01_lg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1441036"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14440/1441036-darksiders_01_lg.jpg"></a><figcaption>War, one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, and his sword.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Darksiders tells the story of War, one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (the others being <a href="/strife/3005-11418/" data-ref-id="3005-11418">Strife</a>, <a href="/fury/3005-3436/" data-ref-id="3005-3436">Fury</a>, and <a href="../../death/94-11419/" rel="nofollow">Death</a>), and his role in the aftermath of a premature Armageddon. Upon receiving a summon for the end times to begin, War throws himself into the midst of the battle between angels and demons and quickly finds out that he is the only Horsemen to have arrived on Earth. While fighting against both sides, War mysteriously loses his powers and is eventually beaten by one of the Destroyer's chosen, <a href="/straga/3005-14546/" data-ref-id="3005-14546">Straga</a>.

They maintain the balance of power between the three kingdoms, and the Horsemen are their enforcers.</p><p style="">The Charred Council summarily charges War with the untimely destruction of the Kingdom of Man, disregarding the Council's law, and upsetting the Balance. For his actions, War is sentenced to death. Rather than consign himself to oblivion, War demands he be sent back to the realm of Earth to discover who was behind the Apocalypse, so that he may clear his name, and restore his rightful status as a Horseman.

Before he can leave however, War is saddled with 'The Watcher', a demon entity who will act as the eyes and ears of the Charred Council, and with whom rests the power to destroy War at a whim. Upon returning to Earth, War discovers that 100 years have passed since the Apocalypse, and sets out on his quest to discover the truth behind what happened to his fellow Horsemen, why the Apocalypse was brought about early, and to what end these actions have been set in motion.</p><p style="">Earth is now a desolate wasteland, barely resembling its former shape. Humankind has long since crumbled, due to <a href="/the-destroyer/3005-14094/" data-ref-id="3005-14094">The Destroyer</a>'s army of demons.

Along the way, Samael grants War some abilities to help him complete his quest. He even helps War tap into his dormant powers and assume his chaos form, at the expense of the Watcher getting a gauntlet to the face.</p><p style="">War sets out to find each of the Four Chosen. The first is <a href="/tiamat/3005-12513/" data-ref-id="3005-12513">Tiamat</a>, the bat queen. On the path to the second of the Four Chosen, War meets Ulthane, an Old One and a legendary weapon-smith. After a small Pigeon (angel) killing contest, he asks War to prove himself by killing <a href="/the-griever/3005-14640/" data-ref-id="3005-14640">the Griever</a>, second of the chosen. Upon his return, War finds that Ulthane has made him a gun; Mercy.</p><p style="">On his journey to find the <a href="/the-stygian/3005-14548/" data-ref-id="3005-14548">Stygian</a>, third of the Chosen, War comes across a demon arena. After some fighting, the demon leader emerges riding on War's former mount, the shadowy steed Ruin. War manages to defeat the demon lord but Ruin, not recognizing his friend and master, proceeds to attack him and knocking him around. The Watcher orders War to kill Ruin seeing as he seems to have lost his mind, but he refuses, and instead sets his sword aside and stands his ground. Ruin proceeds to charge at War and at the last second phases through him, having recognized him again. Thusly mounted, War becomes a Horseman again.</p><p style="">Before his fight with the last of the tower guardians, <a href="/silitha/3005-14547/" data-ref-id="3005-14547">Silitha</a> the Broodmother, she tells War that Samael was misleading him; the Chosen were not guarding the tower, but in fact were guarding against Samael's return to power. That power which the Destroyer stripped and placed inside the hearts of the Chosen. She warned that if Samael regains his power, War would find a bigger threat in him than all of the Chosen combined. War foolishly ignores her and proceeds with the fight.</p><p style="">After War returns all the Chosen's hearts to Samael, he boasts that he has become like a god, that he could kill War in an instant if he so chooses. Yet he still grants War passage to the Black Tower as promised as he empathizes with War's quest for revenge. Samael opens a portal to the tower and just before War steps through, the Horseman declares that they will meet again.</p><p style="">Finally in the Black Tower, War finds Azrael, the Angel of Death, imprisoned inside. He reveals everything about the events that led up to the premature battle between Heaven and Hell, about Abbadon's and Ulthane's involvement. Abbadon, Lord of the Hellguard angels, decided to launch a premature strike on the forces of hell and enlisted the others' help to break six of the seven seals that would start the final battle. The seventh, which if broken would call the Horsemen, was to be left intact. He was sure that his armies would decimate the forces of Hell before the war even began, and they would reforge the seals as if nothing had happened. It would look like Hell had started the war and Heaven responded. After all, who would the Council believe; Heaven's word or that of the "Prince of Lies"? However, they were surprised to discover that by the time the Hellguard arrived on Earth, the entire military might of Hell had already arrived, and thus, butchered the Hellguard before the rest of Heaven's armies could arrive, thereby winning the war in the name of Evil.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1294613-azrael.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1294613" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.55034482758621" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:55.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1294613-azrael.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1294613"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/1294613-azrael.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/1294613-azrael.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Azrael leads War into the Garden of Eden.</figcaption></figure><p style="">With these developments, War decides his deal with the Charred Council is complete; he was innocent. The Watcher decides otherwise, that War must do his duty to restore Balance and kill Azrael for breaking the Law of the Council. Instead, War proceeds to free Azrael, and defeat <a href="/straga/3005-14546/" data-ref-id="3005-14546">Straga</a>, last and most powerful of the Chosen. Afterwards, Azrael takes him into the Garden of Eden to seek the Tree of Knowledge. There, War is granted the "gift" of truth and receives a vision. He sees the events that lead to the Apocalypse, the fate of Abbadon, and things that are yet to come.</p><p style="">When Abbadon was killed by Straga, he was surrounded in darkness and a mysterious, sinister female voice gave him the choice to "Serve in Heaven, or rule in Hell?". Abbadon chose the latter and took up the mantle of the Destroyer, now leading the forces of Hell and guarding the seventh seal. War also sees <a href="/uriel/3005-17037/" data-ref-id="3005-17037">Uriel</a> (Abbadon's second-in-command, who harbors romantic feelings for him and blames War for his death) leading the remaining Hellguard against the Destroyer, and failing. War is shown that the Charred Council foresaw Abbadon's plan for a preemptive strike. They needed to quell Abbadon's defiance but could not send the Horsemen against him and the others without proof since the seals were reforged. The Horsemen would see it as murder, not justice. War was known for his temper and pride, and the Council framed him knowing that he would "slaughter everyone in his way" to clear his name. Finally, he sees himself being killed, stabbed in the back by a large blade. As War recovers from the vision, he finds the handle of the same blade in his hand.</p><p style="">Azrael provides one more piece of wisdom before War sets out to face the Destroyer; the only weapon capable of killing The Destroyer is the Armageddon Blade. The same blade the angels used to break the seals, and Ulthane's greatest work. It was shattered by the Destroyer and hidden in the realm of shadows, War needed to gather the pieces and bring them back to Ulthane to make it anew. During the search for the pieces, War is confronted by Uriel, who challenges him to an ancient pact, an unbreakable vow that will not end until one of them has died by the other's hand. War defeats Uriel in combat, but spares her life to keep her as an ally - for now. Whether or not he wants to, eventually he is going to have to kill her or be killed <i>by</i> her to break the spell upon them.</p><p style="">With the completed Armageddon Blade in hand, Azrael sends War to face the Destroyer, a massive fiery dragon.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1294618-picture_1.png" data-ref-id="1300-1294618" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.43483275663206" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:43.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1294618-picture_1.png" data-ref-id="1300-1294618"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/1294618-picture_1.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/1294618-picture_1.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Destroyer.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Abbadon offers that War join him, arguing the corruption of the Council and that he will be pursued by both Heaven and Hell. He gives War the same choice that he was given "Serve in Heaven, or rule in Hell?", to which War answers: "I choose what once a coward did not", and proceeds to fight, victoriously. Having killed Abbadon, War reaches for the seventh seal, but the Watcher constrains him and taunts him as he takes the Seventh Seal out of his reach, War's ticket to freedom. Seeing what is happening, Uriel stabs War in the back - simultaneously breaking the hold the Watcher has over him and fulfilling their death pact - and then breaks the Seventh Seal during a strike on the Watcher. In addition to severing the Watcher's right arm, breaking the Seventh Seal summons the Four Horsemen: this means that War is resurrected, all of his strength and power restored. Free of the Charred Council's control, War stands up and kills the Watcher. Now an enemy of Heaven, Hell, <i>and</i> the Charred Council, Uriel asks if he will fight the entire universe alone. War lifts the broken seal in his hand saying; "No. Not alone." Three comets streak across the sky, signalling the arrival of the other three Horsemen.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">The combat centres primarily on powerful combos and specialty fatalities. War can equip a gear item alongside his primary weapon, allowing him to switch on the fly between the Crossblade and the Abyssal Chain, for example. Using powerful combos allows War to fill his Wrath Meter which he can then use to unleash powerful Wrath attacks. Wrath attacks include the Blade Geyser attack, where War stabs the ground and makes half-a-dozen blades come up from the ground and damage enemies around him; Stone Skin, which decreases the damage War takes, and increases the damage he dishes out; Immolation, which causes everything War touches to become engulfed in flames; and Pestilence, which slowly saps away surrounding enemies' health. War can also use special fatalities. For instance, War can jump from demonic bat to demonic bat, killing each one without touching the ground. War will also perform more stylized fatalities on bosses and mid-bosses without the need for the derivative quick time events. It should also be noted that War is actually invulnerable during these execution animations. The player can use this to advantage, interrupting the attacks of enemies in order to slow down the combat a little. An example of such an execution is shown in the Church dungeon area where War fights The Jailor, a massive hulk of flesh that smashes cages on the ground. War must attack with the Crossblade, targeting multiple weak points on his body to expose the smaller creature that is controlling the behemoth.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1045010-darksiders_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1045010" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.50869565217391" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:50.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1045010-darksiders_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1045010"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1048/1045010-darksiders_04.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1048/1045010-darksiders_04.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Combat in Darksiders.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Environments in Darksiders are split between large hub areas that offer plenty of room for exploration and smaller, interior dungeon-like areas such as a subway system, derelict buildings and a church that is set up as a demon's central base of operations. War will traverse each of these dungeons killing bosses and mini-bosses to progress throughout the game as well as retrieving gear items. Gear items are featured equipment which War needs in order to open new areas within the large open hubs.</p><p style="">New equipment can also be purchased by selling souls collected by War's Soul Harvest ability to a Soul Trader Demon, Vulgrim. This demon will trade souls and artifacts, the only applicable currency in a post-human world, for new abilities, weapons and armor. These souls can be collected primarily in combat, but can also be found through exploration. Weapons can also be customized by collecting upgrades throughout the game. These upgrades can be equipped and swapped between War's arsenal of weapons. Armor can also be upgraded into the Abyssal Armor by finding the ten pieces throughout the game (the new armor is immediately worn by War upon finding the final piece). With this new armor, War also changes in appearance, from his red, blue, and black, to a more bad-ass gray and black with red-eyes. Health and Wrath capacity can also be increased by collected containers scattered throughout the world, defeating main bosses, and from Vulgrim.</p><p style="">Weapons and armor aren't the only thing at War's disposal, for he can call on his spectral steed, Ruin. War is able to summon and dispel him on the fly with the touch of the shoulder buttons, and enables him to traverse areas he could not on foot. Ruin has access to a dash ability. War's sword attacks also increase drastically in power while he is on Ruin. War's sword, Chaoseater, accumulates chaos as he kills enemies. Once it is full, he can then transform into a large and powerful form (his Chaos Form), for a limited time, and can lay waste to most enemies with ease.</p><h2>Souls</h2><p style="">There are three types of souls that can be found in the world of Darksiders, and they can either be found inside <a href="/treasure-chest/3055-517/" data-ref-id="3055-517">chests</a> (the type of soul inside each chest will be clearly identifiable by its color), or collected from enemies upon their defeat:</p><ul><li><b>Green Souls</b> - these fill the <u>Health</u> bar.</li><li><b>Yellow Souls</b> - these fill the <u>Wrath</u> meter.</li><li><b>Blue Souls</b> - the game’s form of <u>Currency.</u></li></ul><h2>Enemies</h2><h3>Angels</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1543740-angel_champion.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1543740" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.94444444444444" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:94.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1543740-angel_champion.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1543740"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1543740-angel_champion.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1543740-angel_champion.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">The Lords of Heaven are far less numerous on Earth than their demonic enemies, and they have been fighting to take back the dead Earth ever since the Apocalypse.

They are considered to be the Griever's pets.</li><li><b>Shadow Lurker</b> - Invisible entities resembling a large eye; they often trap Tormented Gates. Although they are incredibly physically weak and are personally defenceless, War cannot directly attack them until he's fulfilled the conditions of the challenge that protects each Lurker.</li><li><b>Trauma</b> - massive creatures, even slightly bigger than Gholens. Trauma has gigantic crushing claws.</li><li><b>Wraith</b> - Creatures masked in shadow. They float on the wind, looking for prey.</li><li><b>Grappleclaw</b> - A very dangerous foe; they are large and brutish, fast and deadly, and can certainly take chuncks out of the health bar given the chance.</li><li><b>Goremaw</b> -- Hand-like demons that hang from ceilings.</li></ul><h3>Undead</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1543743-undead.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1543743" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.75810185185185" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1543743-undead.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1543743"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1543743-undead.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1543743-undead.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">The reanimated corpses of the dead, these mindless creatures seek nothing except the destruction of any and all creatures who aren't evil.

He appears in four locations throughout the game, and then only after a different requirement is met for each one. Speaking in a British accent, he challenges War to duels, at which he is surprisingly adept, using his cane as a sword and his hat as a projectile weapon.

The game went into development about five years before its release. After founding Vigil Games, the designers were very drawn to the concept of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Although the full development cycle didn't begin until two years later, many ideas and concepts came up during this two year period.</p><p style="">Most of the gameplay ideas that many consumers and critics said appeared to be taken from other games such as <a href="/god-of-war/3025-244/" data-ref-id="3025-244">God of War</a> and <a href="/the-legend-of-zelda/3025-9/" data-ref-id="3025-9">Zelda</a> were initially designed before the release of said games, according to development director of Vigil Games, <a href="/david-adams/3040-7052/" data-ref-id="3040-7052">David Adams</a>. Adams also stated that they did not have the specific intention to be similar to any other game, nor did they have any particular game that served as a source of inspiration. Instead, Vigil simply wanted to make a darker and more mature action adventure game.</p><p style="">According to post-release developer interviews, a significant amount of gameplay elements were removed before completion, mostly due to space or time constraints. These included items such as the Venom of Apollyon (described as "like a sticky grenade"), a dungeon based on light and dark themes, and an item which allowed the player to control undead armies. Another idea that was cut was Vigil's initial idea of a four-player co-op game, which they quickly found was "ridiculous."</p><p style="">Due to the cancellation of their own game, THQ contracted <a href="/silicon-knights-inc/3010-1004/" data-ref-id="3010-1004">Silicon Knights</a> to help Vigil out with asset creation during development of the game.</p><h2>Voice Talents</h2><ul><li>War - <a href="/liam-obrien/3040-97533/" data-ref-id="3040-97533">Liam O'Brien</a></li><li>The Watcher - <a href="/mark-hamill/3040-3248/" data-ref-id="3040-3248">Mark Hamil</a></li><li>Vulgrim - <a href="/phil-lamarr/3040-89594/" data-ref-id="3040-89594">Phil LaMarr</a></li><li>Samael - Vernon Wells</li><li>Azrael - <a href="/keith-szarabajka/3040-31078/" data-ref-id="3040-31078">Keith Szarabajka</a></li><li>Abaddon - <a href="/troy-baker/3040-93651/" data-ref-id="3040-93651">Troy Baker</a></li><li>Uriel - <a href="/moon-bloodgood/3040-15122/" data-ref-id="3040-15122">Moon Bloodgood</a></li><li>Tiamat - <a href="../../lani-minella/72-1961/" rel="nofollow">Lani Minella</a></li><li>Silitha - Lani Menella</li><li>Straga - <a href="/troy-baker/3040-93651/" data-ref-id="3040-93651">Troy Baker</a></li><li>Ulthane - <a href="/jb-blanc/3040-89365/" data-ref-id="3040-89365">JB Blanc</a></li><li>Charred Council - <a href="/fred-tatasciore/3040-63568/" data-ref-id="3040-63568">Fred Tatasciore</a></li><li>Tortured Gates - <a href="/troy-baker/3040-93651/" data-ref-id="3040-93651">Troy Baker</a></li></ul><h2>Soundtrack</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1540016-darksiders_ost_cover.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1540016" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="1" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1540016-darksiders_ost_cover.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1540016"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1540016-darksiders_ost_cover.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1540016-darksiders_ost_cover.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Album Cover</figcaption></figure><p style="">The official soundtrack for <i>Darksiders</i> was made available for purchase on March 8, 2010.

Velasco and Reagan previously helped compose the music for the first two <i>God of War</i> games. Unusually for a game score, the <i>Darksiders</i> soundtrack features a major spoiler, in the form of calling the final boss fight music "Battle with Abaddon", instead of "Battle with the Destroyer", something that irritated and annoyed most fans.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Track No.</th><th>Song Title</th><th>Running Time</th></tr><tr><td>01</td><td><b>Darksiders

It was released on numerous platforms including Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii, PC, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, and Nintendo DS towards the end of 2008. The game features over 500 teams with 30 international leagues and 41 national teams, 49 stadiums and all new offline and online modes.</p><p style="">One of the new features in the game was the addition of; <i>Adidas Live Season</i>. This will provide weekly stat updates that cover all players and teams in the English Premier League, Spain's La Liga, France's Ligue 1, the German Bundesliga, Italy's Serie A and, strangely, the Mexican Pimera Division. Footballers in the game will have their stats chnged every week so their in game stats will rise or fall depending on how they play in real life.</p><p style="">The demo for Xbox 360 and PS3 was released on September 11th. It allows players to compete in a full exhibition match, two minutes for each half. If at full time the score reflects a draw, a penalty shootout takes place to determine the winner. Teams in the demo include Chelsea, AC Milan, Real Madrid, and Marseille.</p><p style="">FIFA 09 hit shelves in Australia on October 2, in Europe October 3 and in North America October 15, 2008.</p><p style=""> </p><p style=""> </p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Gameplay Features</h3><p style=""><b></b>According to the producer of FIFA 09, David Rutter, over 250 key improvements were made from the previous iteration.</p><p style=""> </p><ul><li><b>Graphics</b> - Overall look of the game has been upgraded from its previous title, FIFA 08. There will be cut scenes while a player is being substituted and the reaction of that player varies depending on his impact during the match. Players are seen warming up if they are substituted during the half time. The crowd also has been improved in terms of graphics and has been regionalized.</li></ul><p style=""> </p><ul><li><b>Physic &amp; Animation System </b>- Improved physics system affects the players and the ball on the pitch thus adding even more realism to the game.

The new licensed teams will include official logos and accurate kits.</li></ul><p style=""> </p><ul><li><b>Weather and Time</b> - Unlike FIFA 08, weather options will be present such as rain and snow. These weather conditions affect the gameplay as well as the appearance of the players. For example, players will wear gloves and/or put their socks up higher.

At the end of each dinner service you are awarded a grade on a scale of 5 stars one being the worst five being the best.<br /><br />Censorship: unfortunately the game is rated a 12 by PEGI and is bleeped over or just features not swearing in anyway, probably an attempt by Ubisoft to make it more appealing to wider audiences unfortunately i think it is this which could ruin it as we all only watch Gordon Ramsay for his wild and colourful tantrums.<br /><br />The game gets progressiveley harder and it becomes more and more complicated to manage, customers, cooking and serving and getting the timing just right.<br /><br />In addition to the Game itself the recipes of the food you cook can be imported from the game so that you can prepare them yourself similar to the game cooking guide.</span></p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>21063</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/1817644-box_hkitchen.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/1817644-box_hkitchen.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/1817644-box_hkitchen.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/1817644-box_hkitchen.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/1817644-box_hkitchen.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1817644-box_hkitchen.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/1817644-box_hkitchen.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Hell's

Humanity made its third and most costly mistake. World War III. Weapons of mass destruction deployed with impunity, razed the land in the blink of an eye. People believed it's the end of the world. The planet Earth was dying. So humanity began to search for a new home in space."</p><p style="">"AD 2074 first contact. SD0001 first warp. SD0010 -- first official SRF mission.

These quests are also optional.</li></ol><h2>Private Actions</h2><p style="">Maximizing your private actions unlock special ending sequences for each character and contribute background to the story. Building relationships also unlocks special combos shared by two party members during battle.</p><h2>Collections</h2><h3>Battle Trophies</h3><p style="">You achieve these in battle by performing very specific actions or by doing an action a certain number of times. Each character has his/her own set of trophies to unlock, some of which are described in your inventory screen, but most of which are secret.</p><h3>Monster Collection</h3><p style="">Each time you fight a monster for the first time, you unlock monster data. You then earn credits for each time you defeat each monster, which can unlock special abilities to be transferred to an item, referred to as a monster jewel.</p><h3>Weapon Collection</h3><p style="">Each time you find or buy a new weapon, or you come across certain enemies carrying weapons, you unlock weapon data. This data is really only useful for informational purposes and achievement hunting.</p><h3>Spaceship Data</h3><p style="">There are several spaceships you can interact with, with data about the ship hidden in various locations. This is also really just informational data with achievement implications.</p><h2>Item Creation and Synthesis</h2><p style="">You can group your characters into 4 groups of up to 3 characters in each group. The combination of several attributes contributes to forming recipes for new items. You can then use ingredients or materials that you have found via treasure hunting, purchased, or won in battle to make those items. Recipes may also be obtained through side quests.</p><h2>Leveling</h2><p style="">You earn experience, individual SP, and party SP. Experience goes toward increasing your characters stats, which occurs automatically at each new skill level. SP is used to unlock new attacks or skills for each player. Party SP is shared across the entire party and can be used to unlock skills for any party member. Party SP is also used in recipe creation.</p><p style="">Experience, individual SP, and party SP are earned through battle. Experience and party SP can also be obtained through treasure and item hunting, and through completion of side quests.</p><h2>Battle System</h2><p style="">Star Ocean: The Last Hope follows in the footsteps of its predecessors and has a primarily real-time combat system. The character controlled on the battle field may also be changed by will of the player. The character initiates a battle by touching an enemy in the field screen and different situations occur depending on the area of contact. If the player manages to initiate the battle by touching the enemy from behind, the battle will begin with a Player Advantage and the enemies will be stunned for a shot period of time. However, if the enemy ambushes the player by initiating the battle by attacking the player from behind, the battle starts with an Enemy Advantage and all the enemies will have their Rush Gauge half filled at the start. A new battle mechanic is also introduced in this installment named Blindsides. If the player controlled character holds down the charge button and initiates a dodge right before an enemy attack, they will perform the deadly blindside maneuver. Blindsides automatically move the player behind the enemy and a 100% critical hit chance rate for the next few attacks.</p><h3>Bonus Board</h3><p style="">When certain requirements are met in battle, tiles are awarded to the player's bonus board. Different colored tiles correlate to a different bonuses awarded at the end of battle:</p><ul><li>Blue Tile - Awarded when a player defeats an enemy with a critical hit. Awards the player with 10% extra experience.</li><li>Yellow Tile - Awarded when a player defeats multiple enemies at once. Awards the player with 10% fol.</li><li>Green Tile - Awarded when a player is ambushed. Awards the player with extra 1 party SP.</li><li>Pink Tile - Awarded when a player defeats an enemy only using skills. Awards the player with 1% HP and MP recovery.</li></ul><p style="">Bonus board tiles stack so it is player advantageous to collect as many tiles as possible. It is possible to lose tiles, however, if the player controlled character dies or the character receives a critical hit. In this situation the player loses half of their connected tiles of each color ie: if you have fourteen connected blue tiles you end up with seven. It is advantageous to earn bonus tiles in such a way as all tiles are connected to one or more others of the same color, as non-paired tiles will always be lost.</p><h2>Reception</h2><p style="">Current reviews of Star Ocean: The Last Hope have ranged in the 50 to 90 range. Critics have noted that occasionally weird dialog and long cutscenes hurt the story, as well as having no option to turn on Japanese voice-overs. Reviewers have been more comfortable with the soundtrack, combat, levelling, framerate, and the sheer size of the game, however. Note that this is a 3 disc game. It does a decent job at limiting disc swaps. Near the end of the game you have access to a teleporter to travel around to the locations you've previously visited, and disc swapping is required here.</p><h2>Star Ocean: The Last Hope International</h2><p style="">Star Ocean: The Last Hope International is an enhanced port of the formerly Xbox 360 exclusive Star Ocean: The Last Hope for Playstation 3. It features new additional content, Japanese and English voice tracks and two sets of character portraits.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>21094</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/2108515-box_sotlh.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/2108515-box_sotlh.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/2108515-box_sotlh.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/2108515-box_sotlh.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/2108515-box_sotlh.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2108515-box_sotlh.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/2108515-box_sotlh.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Star Ocean: The Last Hope]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>4</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-1/]]></api_detail_url><id>1</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: T]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-33/]]></api_detail_url><id>33</id><name><![CDATA[CERO: B]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-36/]]></api_detail_url><id>36</id><name><![CDATA[PEGI: 12+]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-38/]]></api_detail_url><id>38</id><name><![CDATA[OFLC: PG]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2009-02-19 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/star-ocean-the-last-hope/3030-21094/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21105/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-07-15 14:26:50</date_added><date_last_updated>2014-12-15 19:59:15</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[On a post-apocalyptic Earth a catastrophic event forces humans to evolve creating two distinct races, the Echelon and the Sai.

Unlike its past PC based games Stormrise was designed largely for consoles including a specially designed control system. Stormrise was released on March 24, 2009 on the the <a data-ref-id="3045-20" href="/xbox-360/3045-20/" slug="xbox-360">     Xbox 360</a>, <a data-ref-id="3045-35" href="/playstation-3/3045-35/" slug="playstation-3">     PlayStation 3</a> and <a data-ref-id="3045-94" href="/pc/3045-94/" slug="pc">     PC</a>.<br/> <br/><h3>Creating A New Console Friendly  Real-Time Strategy Game<br/></h3>In an attempt to solve the problem of poor controls that have plagued the Real-Time Strategy genre on consoles, Stormrise uses a new line-of-sight camera and control system as well as "Whip Select" which allows for unit selection without a cursor or min-map. In traditional Real-Time Strategy games players are above the battlefield looking down on the map but in Stormrise players see from the point of view of whatever unit they are controlling, this was attempt of making the game easier to control on a console and create a more cinematic experience.<br/> <h2>Races</h2><h3> Echelon <br/></h3>A refined military organization that specializes in Technology and heavy artillery.  Due to their cryogenic sleep they have not been effected by the "Event" and rely on technology to survive on the surface for long periods of time.<br/><br/><h3>Sai</h3>A primitive set of soldiers that possess psionic powers, and have mutation based weapons. While remaining on the surface, most with no option otherwise, they adapted and evolved to thrive in the new environment and eventually developed their special powers.<br/><br/><h2>Story</h2>The world was going to end soon, mankind had done its damage to Earth, and something needed to be done to change that. 22 years after this realization, scientific research produced a force-field that would help stabilize and fix the deteriorating atmosphere. Essentially achieving the end to global warming, the force-field was a symbol of hope to all mankind and a showing of its technological prowess. But there are things that just are not meant to be controlled, things need to happen. Nobody knew it was coming, and nobody could predict its raw power, all that is known about "it," is the name, "The Event." What followed was the storms,  demolishing buildings, destroying roads, whole cities were flattened in just a matter of days. With all this devastation occurring, authorities made giant underground structures filled with cryogenic hibernation chambers, so they could wait out the storms. Word then spread out that there would not be enough room for the whole population in these chambers, and following that panic promptly ensued. After many difficult decisions were made, it was decided that the few privileged were assured safety. The massive doors were then sealed, with the thousands of people forced into a dreamless coma-like sleep that would last centuries. On the outside, however, everything was less than peaceful. The majority of people starved, many went mad, and ripped each other apart in the rage of desperation. <br/><br/>   As nature would have it, there were a few surface dwellers that managed to endure everything that went on around them, and began to slowly evolve into something more. They began to develop extra sensory abilities and became extremely agile. With very limited resources, this new race, "The Sai," began to rebuild what was lost by "The Event." They were left with the partial remains of the technology that their sleeping brethren left behind. Utilizing what was around them, The Sai built makeshift living quarters around the rubble that was once standing. What happened in the past and the 'old population' was only talked about in hushed tones over campfires.  But the cryogenic chambers were only meant to last for so long, and one dark, lonely morning they opened, awakening the long-forgotten inhabitants of the past. As they awoke, they set off to reclaim their planet, emerging as "The Echelon." <br/>   <br/><h2>Echelon Units<br/></h2>The Echelon are made up of armored soldiers, mechanized units and state-of-the-art vehicles. Soldiers utlilze jetpack to traverse the environment vertically as they are not nearly agile as their Sai counterparts. The Echelon are few in numbers compared to the Sai and make every opportunity to preserve their troops with all the technology at their disposal. Their most powerful unit is the Eclipse, a massive vessel armed with the Polaris Rift and storm shields that nullifies Sai Abilities for all units underneath. The Echelon uses the most technologically advanced armor and weapons preferring long range combat and defensive tactics.<br/> <a href="http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/2/26322/1697824-echelon___enforcer_super.jpg" rel="nofollow"> </a><br/> <figure data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1697824-echelon___enforcer.jpg,http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1697825-echelon___infiltrator.jpg,http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1697830-echelon_sentinel__wip_print_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1697824,1300-1697825,1300-1697830" rel="images" data-resize-urls="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/2/26337/1697824-echelon___enforcer.jpg,http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/2/26337/1697825-echelon___infiltrator.jpg,http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/2/26337/1697830-echelon_sentinel__wip_print_.jpg" data-resized="" data-resize-url=""><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1697824-echelon___enforcer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1697824" ><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/2/26337/1697824-echelon___enforcer.jpg"></a><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1697825-echelon___infiltrator.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1697825" ><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/2/26337/1697825-echelon___infiltrator.jpg"></a><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1697830-echelon_sentinel__wip_print_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1697830" ><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/2/26337/1697830-echelon_sentinel__wip_print_.jpg"></a></figure> <br/> <figure data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1697827-echelon___seeker.jpg,http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1698003-echelon___prowler.jpg,http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1697822-echelon___arc_hammer.jpg,http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1697828-echelon___stalker.jpg,http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1697829-echelon__hunter.jpg,http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1698249-echelon___eclipse.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1697827,1300-1698003,1300-1697822,1300-1697828,1300-1697829,1300-1698249" rel="images" data-resize-urls="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/2/26337/1697827-echelon___seeker.jpg,http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/2/26337/1698003-echelon___prowler.jpg,http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/2/26337/1697822-echelon___arc_hammer.jpg,http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/2/26337/1697828-echelon___stalker.jpg,http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/2/26337/1697829-echelon__hunter.jpg,http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/2/26337/1698249-echelon___eclipse.jpg" data-resized="" data-resize-url=""><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1697827-echelon___seeker.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1697827" ><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/2/26337/1697827-echelon___seeker.jpg"></a><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1698003-echelon___prowler.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1698003" ><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/2/26337/1698003-echelon___prowler.jpg"></a><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1697822-echelon___arc_hammer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1697822" ><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/2/26337/1697822-echelon___arc_hammer.jpg"></a><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1697828-echelon___stalker.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1697828" ><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/2/26337/1697828-echelon___stalker.jpg"></a><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1697829-echelon__hunter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1697829" ><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/2/26337/1697829-echelon__hunter.jpg"></a><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1698249-echelon___eclipse.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1698249" ><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/2/26337/1698249-echelon___eclipse.jpg"></a></figure> <br/><h2>Sai Units<br/></h2>The Sai units include evolved humans with psionic powers,  vehicles and ferocious beasts. The Sai are gifted with incredible agility and psionic powers granted to them from their rapid evolution on the surface after the "Event." Not as technically advanced as the Echelon they are not without their own vehicles despite being hastily put together of whatever is left on the surface. The Sai's prized warriors are without a doubt the Sirens who's ranks are filled only with the most gifted women; raised from a young age to master the most powerful psionic abilities such as levitation,  teleportation, mobile shields and a decimating vortex. Unlike The Echelon The Sai generally don't wear a lot of armor but are agile and often prefer close quarters combat making them an aggressive adversary.<br/> <br/> <figure data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1697875-sai___rangers.jpg,http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1697879-sai___spectre.jpg,http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1697935-sai___warriors.jpg,http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1697878-sai___siren.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1697875,1300-1697879,1300-1697935,1300-1697878" rel="images" data-resize-urls="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/2/26337/1697875-sai___rangers.jpg,http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/2/26337/1697879-sai___spectre.jpg,http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/2/26337/1697935-sai___warriors.jpg,http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/2/26337/1697878-sai___siren.jpg" data-resized="" data-resize-url=""><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1697875-sai___rangers.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1697875" ><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/2/26337/1697875-sai___rangers.jpg"></a><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1697879-sai___spectre.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1697879" ><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/2/26337/1697879-sai___spectre.jpg"></a><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1697935-sai___warriors.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1697935" ><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/2/26337/1697935-sai___warriors.jpg"></a><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1697878-sai___siren.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1697878" ><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/2/26337/1697878-sai___siren.jpg"></a></figure> <br/> <figure data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1697877-sai___scorpion.jpg,http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1697872-sai___locust.jpg,http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1697874-sai___rage.jpg,http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1697873-sai___matriarch.jpg,http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1697871-sai___broodling.jpg,http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1697876-sai___rift_worms.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1697877,1300-1697872,1300-1697874,1300-1697873,1300-1697871,1300-1697876" rel="images" data-resize-urls="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/2/26337/1697877-sai___scorpion.jpg,http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/2/26337/1697872-sai___locust.jpg,http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/2/26337/1697874-sai___rage.jpg,http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/2/26337/1697873-sai___matriarch.jpg,http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/2/26337/1697871-sai___broodling.jpg,http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/2/26337/1697876-sai___rift_worms.jpg" data-resized="" data-resize-url=""><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1697877-sai___scorpion.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1697877" ><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/2/26337/1697877-sai___scorpion.jpg"></a><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1697872-sai___locust.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1697872" ><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/2/26337/1697872-sai___locust.jpg"></a><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1697874-sai___rage.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1697874" ><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/2/26337/1697874-sai___rage.jpg"></a><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1697873-sai___matriarch.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1697873" ><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/2/26337/1697873-sai___matriarch.jpg"></a><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1697871-sai___broodling.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1697871" ><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/2/26337/1697871-sai___broodling.jpg"></a><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1697876-sai___rift_worms.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1697876" ><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/2/26337/1697876-sai___rift_worms.jpg"></a></figure> <br/><h2> Characters</h2> <figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/26337/1698392-echelon___geary.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1698392" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.4128035320088" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:141.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/26337/1698392-echelon___geary.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1698392"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/26337/1698392-echelon___geary.jpg"></a><figcaption>Echelon -

However, his success was thanks largely to the machinations of Braniac, who had slowly been draining Earth's protectors of their powers, and eventually conquers all of Earth.</p><p style="">Future Lex time-travels to the present, and tells the still intact Justice League the fate of their planet, and his plan to avert it: by releasing nanites created from the powers of the heroes in the future by Braniac. Future Lex infects much of the population of Earth with new superpowers to swell the ranks of meta-humans for the coming Brainiac invasion.</p><p style="">As one of the new superheroes (or villains), you escape Brainiac's harvester ships with the help of either Oracle and Superman or Calculator and Lex Luthor, and go on to be mentored in the ways of justice or evil.</p><p style="">If you choose to be a hero, your mentor will be either Superman, Wonder Woman, or Batman. For the villain side, your mentor will be Lex Luthor, Circe, or the Joker. You will also begin the game in your mentor's respective home turf (eg Metropolis if Superman or Lex), where the battle between good and evil, heightened by the influx of new Metas, rages on every street corner.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2748/272615-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-272615" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2748/272615-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-272615"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2748/272615-2.jpg"></a><figcaption>Not only can objects be thrown and used as melee weapons, but also they can be charged up and even deflected.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The gameplay is more action oriented than most MMORPGs. You begin with selecting your character's customized stats and look. You can then choose your super power like fire, lightning, etc. You can then chose your power source (for example your fists if it's a Batman-like character or a bow and arrow for a Green Arrow type character) and your movement style like super speed, flight, acrobatics, etc. Combined with traits like super strength or metabolism, you can mix and match many of these gameplay choices and create any type of superhero you want (weapons are also available for your character but are based on whether they are ranged or close-quarter combat items). You get different abilities as you level up like in most traditional MMORPGs (the two types of points that you invest in your character's abilities are skill points and power points). The more you invest towards your hero/villain's skill will cause the effectiveness of that skill to increase (telekinesis for example has a greater range and damage as it is upgraded). Depending on the skills you have, you can climb walls, run fast, jump really high, etc. There are no classes in the game because every aspect of the character is customizable and because superheroes are very adaptable (in the game you can change from an offensive role to defensive role on the fly, affecting the abilities you have). One ability might be used to deal damage but when switched to defensive mode that power is used to knock opponents down.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/899387-dc_scr_env_metro_0041.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-899387" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.5634765625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/899387-dc_scr_env_metro_0041.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-899387"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/19745/899387-dc_scr_env_metro_0041.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/19745/899387-dc_scr_env_metro_0041.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Places from the DC Universe, like Metropolis, will be fully explorable right down to the Daily Planet.</figcaption></figure><p style="">It seems that instead of the traditional "Quests" you have "cases". This is where you must provide a wide range of help to the other legendary superheroes like Superman or Batman. For example, Batman may call you on your communicator to meet him at the docks for help. Also, he will be disappointed and make a remark pertaining to your absence if you didn't show up. You will have a relationship with these characters and they will respond accordingly to your actions and choices. Another example of a case would be that you arrive in Metropolis, one of the fully fleshed and explorable cities/areas in the game, where you must prevent Doomsday from escaping after a huge fight with Superman. Your case would be to stop Lex Luthor's forces from obtaining some of the blood that spilled during the battle. You will be in contact with these superheroes throughout your career. If you play as the villain you will get "Capers" where you work for the villians. So you will actually be fighting other players who are working for the superheroes on the same mission objectives.</p><p style="">The action is not turn based or random; it's all 100% responsive to your button commands like a standard action game.</p><p style="">There is no death in the game, just Knockouts. Instead you can choose to rally back into the fight or withdraw. You can revive unconscious NPCs and other players so that they can help you if and/or when the need arises.</p><h3>Powers</h3><p style="">Players are given the option to setup the powers of their superhero during the initial creation of their character. Powers basically determine what kind of combat abilities they will have and their specific role type. Within each powers skill tree, players have two paths to allocate their points. Powers are currently broken up into:</p><p style=""><b><u>Fire</u></b></p><ul><li>Immolation</li><li>Ignition</li></ul><p style=""><b><u>Ice</u></b></p><ul><li>Cryogenics</li><li>Storm</li></ul><p style=""><b><u>Mental</u></b></p><ul><li>Telekinesis</li><li>Illusion</li></ul><p style=""><b><u>Nature</u></b></p><ul><li>Shape shifting</li><li>Plants</li></ul><p style=""><b><u>Sorcery</u></b></p><ul><li>Summoning</li><li>Destiny</li></ul><p style=""><b><u>Gadgets</u></b></p><ul><li>Tricks</li><li>Traps</li></ul><p style=""><b><u>Light</u></b></p><ul><li>Support</li><li>Assault</li></ul><p style=""><b><u>Electricity</u></b></p><ul><li>Voltage</li><li>Amperage</li></ul><p style=""><b><u>Earth</u></b></p><ul><li>Geokinesis</li><li>Seismic</li></ul><p style=""><b><u>Quantum</u></b></p><ul><li>Time</li><li>Space</li></ul><h3>Weapons</h3><p style="">Weapons determine your basic form of combat. Depending on what type of weapons you choose will determine if your character deals damage up close or from a far. At first players are only allowed to choose one type of weapon skill to learn but after they reach level 10 they can choose from the others available.</p><p style="">At the moment the weapon types are:</p><ul><li>One-Handed</li><li>Two-Handed</li><li>Hand Blaster</li><li>Bow</li><li>Brawling</li><li>Dual Pistols</li><li>Dual Wield</li><li>Martial Arts</li><li>Rifle</li><li>Staff</li></ul><h2>Pricing</h2><p style="">The <a href="../../playstation-3/60-35/" rel="nofollow">PS3</a> version of the game originally retailed for $59.99 while the <a href="../../pc/60-94/" rel="nofollow">PC</a> version originally retailed for $49.99.

It launched on the <a href="/playstation-network-ps3/3045-88/" data-ref-id="3045-88">PlayStation Network </a>Store August 21, 2008 for $14.99 and on Blu-Ray in Europe (except for the UK) with a retail price of €14.99. </p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2689/852571-wrench.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-852571" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.80805687203791" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2689/852571-wrench.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-852571"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2689/852571-wrench.jpg"></a><figcaption>New Wrench Capabilities</figcaption></figure><p style="">The game is stand-alone and does not require the user to have Tools of Destruction. As with most <a href="/ratchet-clank/3025-411/" data-ref-id="3025-411">Ratchet and Clank games</a>, players take control of <a href="/ratchet/3005-120/" data-ref-id="3005-120">Ratchet</a> who wields a large wrench and a huge arsenal of weapons. This time around, Ratchet's wrench gets increased functionality and can be used to move objects in the game world to complete various puzzles and platforming challenges. Insomniac Games decided to have a greater focus on platforming in contrast to the previously combat heavy gameplay.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">The gameplay is very similar to <a href="/ratchet-clank-future-tools-of-destruction/3030-15212/" data-ref-id="3030-15212">Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: Tools of Destruction</a>, but with a couple of new additions. The first of these is your new wrench: the OmniWrench Millennium 12. It has a new ability allowing you to tether things in the world such as platforms or bolts. The other big addition is Light and Dark gameplay, no this does not mean moral choices...</p><p style="">Instead this means that there are a lot of dark caverns in this game that ratchet has to go through. To get light he has to pick up bugs called heliogrubs that glow in the dark, making his wrench act as a torch showing him the road ahead and also keeping away the bat like aliens that inhabit the caves.</p><p style="">The game is fairly short, offering 3-5 hours of gameplay. Unfortunately, unlike other Ratchet and Clank games you can't play the game again on a harder difficulty after beating the game. You also can't jump to previous levels.</p><h2>Levels</h2><p style=""><b>Hoolerfar Island</b></p><p style="">You reach Hoolefar Island after being shot out of a cannon in the intro sequence. You've lost all your weapons so you have to rely on your wrench to fight anything that's attacking you. Hoolefar island is exactly what you want out of a tropical island. You have sandy beaches, palm trees, and sunny weather. The island features a lot of elaborate platforming sequences involving saw blades, flamethrowers, laser grids, grind rails, steam geysers, catapults, and of course you're doing all this while walking straight up a wall using your gravity boots.</p><p style="">The only enemies you'll be seeing here are Anthropods, small red creatures that burrow underground waiting for their prey. These were seen on Sargasso from Tools of destruction.</p><p style=""><b>Morrow Caverns</b></p><p style="">Morrow caverns are the last known location of Captain Angstrom Darkwater's ship and corpse. The caverns are dark and filled with the corpses of Darkwater's crew that were killed when Slag took over. You come here for Darkwater's treasure map that shows the location of the Fulcrum Star. Rusty Pete offers to help guide you through the caverns and has his old Captain Slag's head with him. On your way to Darkwater's ship, you only need to worry about the bats that inhabit the cave. You do this by carrying a hologrub on your wrench. This scares off the bats because they're scared of the light. After you reach the ship, Rusty Pete betrays you and brings Darkwater back to life along with the rest of his undead crew. You then have to fight off the ghost pirates as you make your way out of the caves.</p><p style=""><b>Return To Hoolefar Island</b></p><p style="">After you escape the Morrow Caverns, you follow Slag/Darkwater to stop them from getting their hands on the Obsidian Eye. When you arrive, the Mayor of the Hoolefoids gives you two more weapons to help you in the defense of the island. Immideatly after this, the ghost pirates arrive at the island. The world becomes foggy and green. You then have to fight through waves of Space-robot-pirates (or Decatroids to be precise) while the pirate captain fires cannons at you from his ship. There are also two Enforcers there for no good reason. You have to destroy the ships' cannons to force them to retreat. After you defeat them, the island returns to normal and the Hoolefoids come out of hiding. You then have to pay the Smuggler to translate the Decatroid map.</p><p style=""><b>Darkwater Cove</b></p><p style="">The smuggler leads you to Darkwater Cove where Captain Darkwater hid al of his treasure. You get in by convincing the Gatekeeper that you're actually Angstrom Darkwater. But they remain suspicious of you so you have to solve some puzzles to prove that you're the dreaded Pirate Captain which makes a lot of sense of course. The first is the Angstroms Song where you have to play Darkwater's Concerto of Doom. The pirate plays a part and you have to match him. The second is Angstrom's Brew where you have to solve riddles to figure out what to put in the drink. The third is Angstrom's Shadow where you have to align pieces to make the shadow of Angstrom appear on the wall. When you do this you are ambushed by some pirates. After that you get into the treasure room only to fall into a trap.</p><p style=""><b>Lythoin Caves</b></p><p style="">After falling into the trap in the treasure room, you find yourself in the Lythoin caves, the Catacombs beneath Darkwater Cove. You have to find your way out if you want to save <a href="/talwyn-apogee/3005-9142/" data-ref-id="3005-9142">Talwyn</a>. Sadly Darkwater has sent his ghost pirates to get rid of you once and for all. This is very similar to the Morrow Caverns, it's again dark, there are bats, and sometimes you have to fight pirates. The end of the level has a boss fight against a Rogue who is a giant Pirate with a cannon on his arm. After you defeat him you reach the bay and you and the Smuggler follow the Pirates out to the Azorean Sea.</p><p style=""><strong>Azorean Sea</strong></p><p style="">You follow Darkwaters ship out to the Azorean Sea to end this once and for all. The level is basically a boss fight against Darkwater and Slag. If he is Darkwater he can only be hurt by throwing ghost skulls at him, once you hit him once or twice, he will turn into slag allowing you to hit him with everything you got. The fight consists of stages across multiple ships with regular enemies in between. Once you defeat him you get the Fulcrum Star and find out where Clank is located.</p><h2>Storyline</h2><p style="">The story of Quest for Booty is told by <a href="/rusty-pete/3005-5329/" data-ref-id="3005-5329">Rusty Pete</a>, <a href="/captain-slag/3005-9133/" data-ref-id="3005-9133">Captain Slag</a>'s trusty sidekick. The story starts with an opening a storybook and narrator talking scene. Rusty Pete then recaps the story of Tools Of Destruction briefly and then sets up the first mission.</p><p style="">The story of Quest for Booty is focused on Ratchet searching for Clank and continues the story from Tools of Destruction. <a href="/ratchet/3005-120/" data-ref-id="3005-120">Ratchet</a> and <a href="/talwyn-apogee/3005-9142/" data-ref-id="3005-9142">Talwyn</a> fly up to a floating pirate base on Planet Merdegraw with Aphelion. There, they start searching for <a href="http://ratchet.wikia.com/wiki/Captain_Darkwater" rel="nofollow">Captain Darkwater</a> who was an expert on <a href="http://ratchet.wikia.com/wiki/Zoni" rel="nofollow">Zoni</a> culture, only to encounter Rusty Pete wandering while holding the head of Captain Slag. This attracts the attention of some pirates and a Rouge. The Rouge shoots Ratchet out of a cannon only to have him land on an adjacent pirate ship. Ratchet and Talwyn fight through the fleet and Ratchet catapults himself to another ship. They fight some more enemies and Ratchet catapults himself to another ship but ends up flying into a cannon. Talwyn is also thrown into the same cannon. The Rouge commands the pirates to blast them towards Morrow Caverns so Pythors can devour them. Rusty Pete pretends to be Captain Slag by putting his head on and successfully fools the pirates. He commands the Rouge to shoot Ratchet and Talwyn towards Hoolefar Island, where they will find exactly what they're looking for. The Rouge mercilessly agrees and the pirates blast Ratchet and Talwyn towards they island.</p><p style="">Hoolefar Island is an island on Merdegraw, a tropical, pirate infested planet that has been spared from Tachyon's wars. Hoolefar island is home to the Hoolefoids, a purple fish-like race. The Hoolefoids are known to be huge Ratchet fans and you can often hear them talking to one another about Ratchet's various adventures. They also want Ratchet to be their new leader as they are not happy with their current ruler, Barnabus Worley; however, that story thread never progresses beyond that.</p><p style="">Ratchet wakes up on the shore of Hoolefar Island and sees Clank trapped in an energy field. Clank says something then disappears. Ratchet and Talwyn traverse the wilderness and Ratchet zip lines toward the beach, where they are greeted by Barnabus Worley, the Mayor of Hoolefar Island. Mayor Worley tells them the supply beacon won't work so they can't send out messages. Ratchet fixes the 5 wind turbines, but the beacon operator tells him that someone uncoupled the power couplings and that they need a Standard GrummelNet Versa Bolt to reconnect the couplings. Ratchet buys one from the Smuggler for 10,000 Bolts. The operator fixes the bolt in and Ratchet cranks it. The couplings work and a bridge opens to a Grav-ramp with a trapeze that leads to the top of the beacon. Ratchet traverses it and cranks one final Versa Bolt and powers the beacon. The Mayor shows Ratchet The Obsidian Eye, the most powerful lorernthzian telescope. It does not work as the Obsidian Eye's power source; the Fulcrum Star is guarded by Darkwater's body in his ship. Ratchet decides to find it. Rusty Pete arrives at the island and tells them of Darkwater's ship and brings them to Morrow Caverns where it is hidden.</p><p style="">Talwyn accidentally gets trapped behind a door. As soon as Ratchet boards the ship he finds Darkwater's dismembered head. He picks it up and a map that falls out. Rusty Pete tells Ratchet he'll check for booby traps and sneaks over to Darkwater's body. He double crosses Ratchet and sticks the head of <a href="http://ratchet.wikia.com/wiki/Captain_Slag" rel="nofollow">Captain Slag</a> on Darkwater's body. Slag possesses the body, but so does Darkwater. Ratchet frees Talwyn from a cave and runs from Morrow Caverns, with Slag/Darkwater sending re-animated pirates after them. They get to Hoolefar island on a sail barge just as Slag/Darkwater attacks and they defend the island from him.</p><p style="">Afterwards they get the The Smuggler to decipher the map. It is the map to Darkwater's cove, an island where Darkwater hid his treasure. Ratchet proves himself as Darkwater and they get into the treasure room, but as Ratchet runs to the star, a hole opens up and he falls down. Slag appears and takes Talwyn. Ratchet escapes from the Lythoin Caves he was trapped in and flies with the Smuggler to Slag's fleet. He frees Talwyn and they confront Slag/Darkwater. They defeat him, which breaks the curse that brought the pirates back to life. Slag falls into the sea and Rusty Pete drops the Fulcrum Star and jumps in after him.</p><p style="">Ratchet grabs the Star and heads back to Hoolefar Island and powers the Obsidian Eye.

The game's most notable feature was its 256-player Domination mode.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">MAG was a multiplayer-only first person shooter developed by <a href="/zipper-interactive/3010-1136/" data-ref-id="3010-1136"> Zipper Interactive</a>, creators of the <a href="/socom-us-navy-seals/3025-628/" data-ref-id="3025-628"> SOCOM</a> franchise. The game was renowned for supporting up to 256 players in each match consisting of platoons of multiple 8-person squads. The maps featured in the game were, for obvious reasons, very large, and so the squads could spawn pretty far apart from each other, but work to converge on a single location. This style of gameplay was meant to emulate the idea of being part of a small team which is also part of a much larger battle.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1425/963778-1__11_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-963778" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1425/963778-1__11_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-963778"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1425/963778-1__11_.jpg"></a><figcaption>War never changes.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The general shooting and gameplay in MAG is similar to other modern first-person shooters like <a href="/battlefield-bad-company/3025-1215/" data-ref-id="3025-1215"> Battlefield: Bad Company</a> or <a href="/modern-warfare-2/3030-24713/" data-ref-id="3030-24713"> Modern Warfare 2</a>, and MAG also features a <a href="/ranking-system/3015-2163/" data-ref-id="3015-2163"> ranking system</a> similar to those games. Players earn experience through many actions in the field, from killing enemies to healing allies and completing objectives. At launch it had a standard Call of Duty style levelling system, where the player would unlock new weapons and gadgets as they ranked up, but a massive update in December 2010 changed the unlock system to instead be purchase based - the experience points gained while playing could be spent in the game's marketplace to buy new guns, gadgets, weapon accessories and cosmetic items, such as sunglasses, headsets and camouflage patterns, and a large part of the experience points would be refunded when changing to another faction.</p><p style="">At the beginning of the game, the player chooses from one of three generic <a href="/rivaling-factions/3015-3656/" data-ref-id="3015-3656"> military groups</a>. Though there are subtle differences to each group, it is primarily an aesthetic choice. However, after reaching a certain level, the player can return himself to level one (a la <a href="/call-of-duty/3025-82/" data-ref-id="3025-82"> Call of Duty</a>'s Prestige Mode) and side with a different group.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/91543/1351295-raven_dom.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1351295" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.947265625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:94.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/91543/1351295-raven_dom.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1351295"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/91543/1351295-raven_dom.jpg"></a><figcaption>Raven Domination</figcaption></figure><p style="">Once in the game, one might notice a distinct similarity to the <a href="/battlefield/3025-51/" data-ref-id="3025-51"> Battlefield</a> series' signature Conquest mode. Both attacking and defending armies fight towards their objectives while trying to maintain forward bases and vehicles in order to keep an advantage. Different <a href="/weapon-slot-loadout/3015-2629/" data-ref-id="3015-2629"> loadouts</a> are beneficial to the team, such as <a href="/medic/3015-5813/" data-ref-id="3015-5813"> medics</a> and <a href="/engineer/3015-1338/" data-ref-id="3015-1338"> engineers</a>.

Once a player reaches level 15, they are eligible to apply to be a Squad Leader. The squad system in the game revolves around four platoons of four eight man squads, with the leader being the highest ranked soldier in each group. The squad leaders' are responsible for commanding the troops in their squad to accomplish various tasks, such as defence of a forward base or an assault on an objective, in order to improve the division's chances of victory. They can use several special abilities to aid in the fight, such as calling in air strikes and troop drops. In order to give players incentive to follow their Squad Leader's orders, marked objectives and enemies eliminated in a close vicinity will receive double the <a href="/experience-points/3015-39/" data-ref-id="3015-39"> XP</a>.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4647/1044169-magpic1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1044169" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.51797385620915" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:51.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4647/1044169-magpic1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1044169"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4647/1044169-magpic1.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4647/1044169-magpic1.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Choppers are always a threat.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Alongside a squad leader, the highest ranking player in each platoon is elected as Platoon Leader and is able to give orders and mark objectives to everyone in their platoon. They also gain more powerful abilities like Gas Bombardments and Precision Airstrikes. Similarly, the highest ranking player of the entire unit is elected as Officer in Charge, and is able to issue commands to every soldier in every platoon, similarly to Battlefield 2's <em>Commander mode</em>. Here is how this system is broken down:</p><ul><li>Each team has 128 players and is led by the Officer in Charge.</li><li>Teams are broken down into 4 platoons, consisting of 32 players each. Each platoon is led by a Platoon Leader.</li><li>Platoons are broken down into 4 squads, consisting of 8 players each.

Governments have squandered their money, and are no longer able to maintain a standing army overseas to secure their interests. Therefore, Private Military Corporations have stepped up to take over, and the game centres on three such corporations vying for government contracts. The three playable factions featured in the game are Raven, Valour, and S.V.E.R.</p><p style=""><b>Raven</b></p><p style="">An Euro-centric PMC, Raven is the high tech group of the game. Many of their armour sets have a futuristic appearance, and their weapon load-outs are based on military prototypes or sleek, ergonomically designed weaponry.</p><p style=""><b>Valour</b></p><p style="">A PMC most closely resembling the modern <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/united-states-army/3015-5271/" data-ref-id="3015-5271">U.S. Army</a>, wearing armor similar to what would be seen on an everyday soldier and using weapons consistent with the current generation such as M16s and .50 Cals.</p><p style=""><b>S.V.E.R.</b></p><p style="">The game's stereotypical ragtag team of terrorists. Most soldiers wear piecemeal armour or just plain clothes and use weaponry most commonly associated with the Cold War or black markets: AK-47s, RPGs, etc.</p><p style="">Each of the three groups, and consequently the missions taken on in game, involve either assaulting or defending locations of interest to the PMCs, such as oil refineries and bases housing state of the art equipment, in an attempt to hinder their opponents' progress.</p><h2>Game types</h2><p style="">There are 4 featured game types in MAG, and two additional types available as DLC:</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4647/1044175-magpic3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1044175" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.49514563106796" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:49.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4647/1044175-magpic3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1044175"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4647/1044175-magpic3.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4647/1044175-magpic3.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The large battles of MAG.</figcaption></figure><p style=""><b>Domination</b></p><p style="">A 256-player Attack and Defend mode.</p><p style="">The main game mode with the two teams split into Attackers and Defenders. The Attackers progress across the map in stages, completing objectives along the way, similar to the Conquest mode seen in Bad Company or Invasion mode seen in Halo: Reach. As they complete one objective, for example destroying a set of bunkers, the next area of the map will unlock, along with a new objective. There are 3 stages to this process. The Defenders must simply hold off the attackers until time runs out in order to win.</p><p style=""><b>Acquisition</b></p><p style="">A 128-player Capture the Flag style mode.</p><p style="">In this mode, the attacking team must steal two prototype vehicles from the defending team, and drive them to a capture point.</p><p style=""><b>Sabotage</b></p><p style="">A 64-player Attack and Defend mode.</p><p style="">Similar to Domination but on a smaller scale. Attackers must complete a couple of set objectives in order to succeed, while the Defenders must try and hold them off.</p><p style=""><b>Suppression</b></p><p style="">A 64-player Team Deathmatch mode.</p><p style="">To help new players into the game, only Suppression is available at the beginning of the game. As higher levels are reached the other match types will begin to unlock. Furthermore, to keep veteran players interested in playing the full variety of modes, extra bonuses are given to a particular match type during random intervals of time. One week, Raven soldiers might gain a small experience bonus for playing Acquisition, while Valor gains a command bonus for playing Domination. Another week, the bonuses might change completely.</p><p style=""><b>Interdiction</b></p><p style="">A 128-player Team Deathmatch mode.</p><p style="">Introduced as part of MAG's first purchasable DLC, Interdiction includes three new maps with a heavy focus on vehicle combat. Each squad is able to utilize their own APC, allowing for a maximum of 16 APCs to be concurrently active in a match.</p><p style=""><b>Escalation</b></p><p style="">A 96-player Team Objective mode.</p><p style="">Introduced as part of MAG's second purchasable DLC, Escalation includes three new maps, and allows for simultaneous battles between the three different factions at the same time. Each faction uses a single 32-player platoon fighting for control over three objectives.</p><h2>Downloadable Content</h2><p style="">Zipper has released four DLC packs to date. Both the first two DLC packs became a apart of the main game without the need to access the PSN store as of patch 1.06.</p><p style=""><b>Trooper Pack</b></p><p style="">The Trooper pack was the first downloadable content pack available and was released for free. It included changes to all three factions in the form of higher fire rates and stability. Additionally, two new camouflage patterns were made available, light and dark for all three factions. A new flash grenade was also included.</p><p style=""><b>Fast Attack Pack</b></p><p style="">The Fast Attack pack was the second DLC released and is also free. Upgraded variants the top tier snipe rifle was added to the main game. A new type of armor was also part of the package.</p><p style=""><b>Interdiction</b></p><p style="">The first of two packs that cost money, Interdiction includes a new game mode, new multiplayer maps, and other in-game rewards.

Blazkowicz</a>, star of the <a data-ref-id="3025-210" href="/wolfenstein/3025-210/" slug="wolfenstein">    Wolfenstein franchise</a>. This game is something of a direct sequel to <a data-ref-id="3030-19181" href="/return-to-castle-wolfenstein/3030-19181/" slug="return-to-castle-wolfenstein">    Return to Castle Wolfenstein</a> in that events of that game are referenced, but the game is designed to stand on its own without needing to know much of the history of the characters.</p><p style="">Like previous games in the series, Wolfenstein puts you in the shoes of a US soldier, sent behind enemy lines to stop secret Nazi projects involving the occult. This time, the Nazis are attempting to harness the power of some sort of alternate dimension known as Black Sun. They can do this using lost artifacts, such as portals and medallions. You obtain a medallion in the early portions of the game that enables you to enter the Veil, a world that exists between the two dimensions. When in the Veil, you move more quickly, and you'll also earn additional veil powers, such as a shield, a damage increase, and the ability to slow time. Some of these powers are used for puzzle solving, others are better in combat situations.</p><p style="">Unlike many first-person shooters, Wolfenstein has a hub or an overworld that you can freely roam in, and side missions that you can find by talking to people found in this hub. Typically, the hub--technically the streets of a fictional German town called Isenstadt--is there for you to talk to people, advancing the story, which in turn unlocks another mission. Isenstadt is broken up into multiple areas, separated by load times. The game will also stop to load when you enter an actual mission. The missions themselves are linear in the ways you'd expect from a first-person shooter. Along the way, you'll find gold, intelligence documents, and mystical tomes, all of which serve to unlock additional upgrades for your weapons and <a data-ref-id="3015-2943" href="/the-veil/3015-2943/" slug="the-veil">    Veil</a> abilities.</p><h2>Weapons and Upgrades</h2><p style="">There are eight known weapons to find in the world of Wolfenstein, not including grenades or a limited number of melee &amp; thrown weapons that can be utilized. Some are traditional World War II era Nazi guns and others are based on Veil technology, ostensibly created by some Nazi secret weapons project. Some of the different black powder based firearms available for use in Wolfenstein include the <a href="///">    MP40</a>, <a href="///">    MP43</a>, <a href="///">    KAR98</a>, and the <a href="///">    Panzerschreck</a>. Some of the Veil-based weaponry includes the Particle Cannon and the Tesla Gun. All weapons, including grenades, can be <a data-ref-id="3015-133" href="/upgradeable-weapons/3015-133/" slug="upgradeable-weapons">    upgraded</a> at various <a data-ref-id="3015-1103" href="/shopping/3015-1103/" slug="shopping">    Black Market</a> locations found within the town of Isenstadt. Upgrades are purchased with money earned by completing missions, finding bags and bricks of gold, and completing side objectives as you come across various <a href="///">    NPC</a>'s in town. Before you are able to purchase upgrades for the different weapons you find in the game, you will need to unlock them by completing different objectives such as finding a certain number of pieces of intelligence, or completing a certain level. These requirements are all clearly marked next to each upgrade when you visit the Black Market shops.</p><table class="t-editor full-width with-border"><tbody><tr><th>Weapon</th><th>Description</th><th>Upgrades</th></tr><tr><td><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/1301887-mp40.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/1301887-mp40.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_small/1301887-mp40.jpg"></a><figcaption>MP40</figcaption></figure></td><td><b><a href="../../mp40/93-265/" rel="nofollow">    MP40</a></b> -

Engaging this mode allows BJ to see into the world of the Veil, accessing passageways and seeing objects that normally would be invisible to the naked eye. There are numerous upgrades available for both the Veil medallion itself, and for the various Veil powers that are unlocked progressively throughout the game when the player finds the Mire, Shield, and Empower crystals. These powers can be used individually or in combination with one another, and when they are active it depletes the player's available veil energy. Veil energy is easily replaced by stepping into any of the common veil pools, which can be seen even when not in the Veil. Veil and crystal upgrdes are all unlocked by collecting hidden tomes throughout the world.</p><h3>Veil Medallion Upgrades</h3><ul class="plain-list"><li><b>Inner Light</b> ($1500) - Increases available veil energy pool</li><li><b>Veil Sight</b> ($2000) - Allows BJ to see enemies through walls</li><li><b>Inner Brilliance</b> ($1500) - Increases veil energy beyond even what Inner Light provides.

Much like its spiritual predecessor <a data-ref-id="3030-15849" href="/flow/3030-15849/">flOw</a>, flower is much less about the gameplay than it is about a different meaning of a game.</p><p style="">thatgamecompany's co-founder, <a data-ref-id="3040-82903" href="/jenova-chen/3040-82903/">Jenova Chen</a>, has described it as being like "video game poetry." It is not too difficult to interpret there being an environmental message behind the game, or at least a contrast to urban living being explored. Bringing unique elements yet to be seen in this generation of consoles, flower has gained a dedicated following.</p><h3>Inspiration</h3><p style="">In <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9y6MYDSAww" rel="nofollow">a TED talk about "Are Video Games Art?"</a>, <a data-ref-id="3040-98025" href="/kellee-santiago/3040-98025/">Kellee Santiago</a> of <a data-ref-id="3010-5521" href="/thatgamecompany/3010-5521/">thatgamecompany</a>, said the game was "<strong>an expression of director,</strong> <a data-ref-id="3040-82903" href="/jenova-chen/3040-82903/"><strong>Jenova Chen</strong></a><strong>, who moved from the extremely metropolitan area of Shanghai, China to the relatively more rural area of California. He was just amazed at these huge rolling landscapes, and yet he found over time, he started to miss those elements of the city he grew up with. And so although it starts in these very open, clean environments; as the player goes through the game, they realise it's about trying to find a harmony or balance between the elements of urban and the natural</strong>."</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">Essentially, the player controls the wind. The gameplay involves guiding a stream of petals around various landscapes in which you will be able to interact with the flowers there in some way, depending on the particular level. All motion in the game is designed to be controlled using the SIXAXIS functionality of the <a data-ref-id="3045-35" href="/playstation-3/3045-35/">PlayStation 3</a> controller. The creators are trying to immerse the player in another experience when playing flower, which they are trying to achieve by the use of stunning visuals complemented by a soothing musical score, and with the field of vision in the game being wider than in most games to better mimic a human's peripheral vision and depth perception. The visual fidelity of Flower is in large part due to the game being able to render and simulate 200,000 blades of grass on-screen at any one time, surely allowing it to claim the coveted boast of the 'best grass in video games...ever'. The only use of the buttons in gameplay is holding any button to accelerate.</p><h3>Hidden/Secret Flowers</h3><p style="">Each level contains three groups of secret flowers, some of which are activated by blooming certain flowers in a particular area and others are hidden from the path the game leads you through. Each batch collected leaves a seed in the pot of your flower in the menu upon completion of the level. Each seed you collect will also make your flower at the menu open up to a more full bloom. Obtaining all three secret flower groups for all six levels will grant you the Dream gold trophy, which will also change the default view from the apartment, this view replaces the urban environment with a sunny field in the foreground and a grassy hill in the background. This is thought to show that the flowers' dream has come true.</p><h2>Level design</h2><p style="">It would seem that the main menu in flower, from which each level is loaded, is based around an urban apartment. The different levels are said to be the 'dreams' of different flowers that are represented in this apartment. The flowers appear in the following order when all the levels are unlocked: Pink, Red, Yellow, Blue, Purple, White. Every single flower level adds something unique or introduces a new type of flower.</p><h3>Pink Flower</h3><p style="">Gazing into this flower opens a wind based level. Players are introduced to the blue flowers which make wind blow to power up the many windmills. Afterwords player traverse a canyon until they gain more speed and end up powering more windmills.</p><h3>Red Flower</h3><p style="">This is the second level you unlock. It is a color based level that starts in sepia tones. When you unleash the power of the red flowers color starts popping into the world. In the final area you can gain the power to color grass by touching different stones.</p><h3>Yellow Flower</h3><p style="">The first level focuses on introducing the basic flower mechanics. Grabbing yellow flowers makes red flowers spawn, and red flowers renew and reinvigorate the area around them turning it green and filled with life.</p><h3>Blue Flower</h3><p style="">Using windmills to create electricity and illuminate the ground at nighttime is the new mechanic presented here. Here you are able to "charge" electrically the petals that follow you and transmit electricity from lamp post to lamp post until you finish the level.</p><h3>Purple Flower</h3><p style="">The dreariest level in the game, you must reach the end while nullifying the threatening electrical power grids, that can burn you and hurt you. Culminates with a dash and dodging of falling debris and is apparently directly connected to the final level.</p><h3>White Flower</h3><p style="">This is the final level, the new mechanic introduced is renovating the world, at the beginning the petals become super charged similar to when you could color the grass in the red color level. You now have the power to eliminate the corruption in the city, and renovate it and repaint it into a vibrant and beautiful place once more.</p><p style="">Each dream/level is based on an aspect of urban life with flower presumably showing a contrast to that within the level. So, for example, one level will be based on color, with the game world initially starting out as desaturated and gray like in most urban landscapes, but with progressively more color coming into the landscape as you interact with it. There are six levels in total, plus the credits level.</p><h2>Awards</h2><p style="">In addition to being critically well received, flower won numerous awards including</p><ul><li>Best Indie Game - Playboy</li><li>Best Original Soundtrack - X-Play</li><li>Best Independent Game of the Year - SpikeTV Video Game Awards</li><li>Best Downloadable Game of the Year - TheSixthAxis</li><li>Download Game of the Year - 1UP</li><li><a data-ref-id="3015-3244" href="/e3-2009/3015-3244/">E3</a> Gold Award - <a data-ref-id="3010-3694" href="/gamepro/3010-3694/">GamePro</a></li><li>Best Downloadable Game - GameSpy</li><li>PS3 Special Achievement for Innovation - IGN</li><li>Best Original Game - UGO</li><li>Casual Game of the Year - AIAS</li><li>Oh, and <a data-ref-id="3040-44184" href="/david-jaffe/3040-44184/">David Jaffe</a> called flower his Game of the Year.

In order to clear an area, the main missions for that area must be completed and the EDF's control must be reduced to zero. Control can be reduced by two means; Destroying EDF buildings or by completing Guerrilla Actions.</p><p style="">There are various Guerrilla Actions:</p><ul><li><b>House Arrest</b> - The player must rescue hostages from the EDF and return them to base.</li><li><b>Guerrilla Raid</b> -The player is tasked with aiding the Red Faction in ridding an area of EDF soldiers. To do this, players must advance into the area and clear out the building. Another guerrilla will then plant a bomb inside the key building, which will destroy the building.</li><li><b>Transportation</b> - Steal a specific vehicle and return to base within the allotted time.</li><li><b>Demolition Master</b> - Timed mini game centered around destroying specific targets under preset conditions.</li><li><b>Heavy Metal</b> - The player is required to kill a certain amount of EDF troops/vehicles given the destructive vehicle.</li><li><b>EDF Assault</b> - Given over the radio, Mason must help the Red Faction protect an area by killing all the EDF that attack.</li><li><b>Steal Convoy</b> - Given over the radio, the player must intercept an EDF convoy, steal the targeted vehicle, and return it to base.</li><li><b>Destroy Convoy</b> - Given over the radio, the player must intercept an EDF convoy and destroy all the targets.</li><li><b>Interception</b> - Given over the radio, the player must chase down the target, retrieve the intel, and make it back to base.</li></ul><p style="">There are also varying types of EDF buildings to destroy. How to go about their destruction is completely up to the player. These types of buildings include:</p><ul><li><b>Low importance Buildings</b> - These buildings can be identified on the mini map by their red outline. These are usually unguarded but offer a little control loss.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Medium Importance Buildings</b> - These buildings are marked with a blue marker on the map and offer a significant amount of control loss when destroyed. Certain medium structures belong to a set, such as smokestacks or wind turbines. How heavily guarded a medium importance building or structure is usually depends on its location; however, destroying one will always raise the alert level.</li><li><b>High Importance Buildings</b> - These buildings are specially marked and well guarded against attack, but offer the greatest amount of control loss.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Propaganda</b> - Unmarked billboards and signs that can be destroyed for both control loss and morale boost (and the Free Your Mind achievement/trophy).</li></ul><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6382/309146-red6.png" data-ref-id="1300-309146" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6382/309146-red6.png" data-ref-id="1300-309146"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6382/309146-red6.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6382/309146-red6.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Morale can be gained by completing missions.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Another factor in the campaign mode is the morale level of a sector. The morale meter determines how well the population supports Mason and how willing they are to fight the EDF. A higher morale means more support from fellow Red Faction members during confrontations with the EDF, and a higher salvage bonus upon the completion of story missions. Morale can be raised by destroying propaganda, completing actions, completing missions, and by killing a large amount of EDF troops. However, morale can be lost by the deaths of friendly troops and innocent civilians, either by Mason's hands or by the EDF's hands. Morale is also lost each time the player dies.</p><p style="">Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, is the collection of salvage. Salvage functions as the currency of the Red Faction, and is implied to hold great value on Mars due to lack of resources. The salvage collected will go towards the purchasing of new weapons and upgrades at a safe house. New equipment and upgrades unlock as the player progresses through the game and completes guerrilla actions. There are four main sources of salvage: story missions, guerrilla actions, EDF vehicles, and EDF property. While not all EDF property will drop salvage, any property that is NOT owned by the EDF will never leave salvage behind when destroyed (except for propane tanks and other explosives).</p><p style="">During the single player campaign, players are able to find various collectibles/destructibles. These include:</p><ul><li><b>Ore Deposits</b> - there are 300 of these spread across the in-game world. They are shown as orange dots on the minimap. Destroying an ore mine rewards the player with a small amount of salvage points.

For example, the player could find himself in a match where the health has been lowered, friendly fire has been turned on, and unlimited ammo is activated. The game also changes up the starting equipment, so players could start the match with powerful weapons or a sledgehammer and nothing else.</p><p style="">The player is able to earn <a data-ref-id="3015-39" href="/experience-points/3015-39/">experience points</a> during each match.

If it completely fills, the player unlocks something. The unlocks come in the form of new characters to play as, new game modes, new sledgehammers, and/or bonus XP events. The bonus XP events occur when the player does something unique during a match. Bonus XP events can include killing the top player on the other team, killing enemies without a backpack equipped, recovering to full health after being near death, and much more.</p><h3>Modes</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1104410-944786_20080801_embed001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1104410" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.56279069767442" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1104410-944786_20080801_embed001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1104410"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1104410-944786_20080801_embed001.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1104410-944786_20080801_embed001.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Damage Control is one of the many multiplayer modes.</figcaption></figure><ul><li><b>Anarchy</b> - Anarchy is a free-for-all <a data-ref-id="3015-451" href="/deathmatch/3015-451/">deathmatch mode</a> which pits all players against each other in one of many maps.

Enemy control points first must be destroyed, and then recaptured using the Reconstructor.</li><li><b>Demolition</b> - In Demolition, one player on each team is designated as the Destroyer, and then must destroy everything in sight, gaining points for the team. Killing the enemy Destroyer will delay their destruction for nine seconds, until a new Destroyer is randomly selected.</li><li><b>Siege</b> - Siege is an <a data-ref-id="3015-3294" href="/assault/3015-3294/">Assault</a>-type game mode, which splits players into two teams, one attacking and one defending. The defensive team is tasked with protecting several structures, while the offensive team must knock them down (gaining points for their team).

Later in the game, the rocket launcher is attached to some more heavily armored vehicles.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><h3>Peacekeeper</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/1378826-1370079_rfg_2010_01_26_01_16_09_79_super.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1378826" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.58510638297872" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:58.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/1378826-1370079_rfg_2010_01_26_01_16_09_79_super.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1378826"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1378826-1370079_rfg_2010_01_26_01_16_09_79_super.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1378826-1370079_rfg_2010_01_26_01_16_09_79_super.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Peacekeeper</figcaption></figure><ul><li>A close-range fully automatic shotgun, the Peacekeeper was traditionally used for crowd control by the EDF before adaptation to the warfare that ravages Mars in the game.

creators of Marvel Ultimate Alliance and co-creators of Quake 4, which is also published by Activison. The game takes place during both the past and present, hurling you back and forth between the 1950's and present day, with the main story being focused on the Cold War and some of the secrets that the Soviet Union had been hiding from the rest of the world. The biggest secret of all turns out to be time manipulation, the game's selling point, which was discovered on the remote Soviet island of Katorga-12. The game has many aspects of a first person shooter, including puzzles that you must use your abilities to solve, and aging and renewing items either organic or non-organic, while also bringing in "old-school" shooter elements such as non-regenerating health and med kits that the player has to pick up throughout the levels.</p><h2>Story</h2><h3>Backstory</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31169/1522657-250px_viktor_barisov.png" data-ref-id="1300-1522657" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="1.556" data-width="250" style="width: 250px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:155.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31169/1522657-250px_viktor_barisov.png" data-ref-id="1300-1522657"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/31169/1522657-250px_viktor_barisov.png"></a></figure><p style="">In the year 1950, the leader of the Soviet Union, Josef Stalin, is looking for a weapon to give him a military edge over the United States. Stalin finds what he hopes is that weapon, a mysterious new material named Element 99, found on a mysterious island named Katorga-12. Element 99 could produce an unprecedented amount of energy. The new element possessed a grave risk of contamination, but Stalin was willing to take those risks. Stalin orders that investigations and tests be conducted on the new power source. One of the scientists charged with investigating the element was a man named Barisov. On September 21, 1950, Barisov abandoned all safety protocols and</p><p style="">activated an Element 99 device which lead to some sort of catastrophic event that consumed the entire island. Information about the island is ordered to be buried and erased from memory by the Soviet leaders.</p><p style="">The island was all but lost for 50 years until 2010 when an American satellite scans and discovers massive radiation spikes originating from the island. With nothing but a suspicion and radiation readings Titan One sends Captains Devlin and Renko to the island on a reconnaissance mission. Flying into restricted airspace the recon chopper is hit by an E.M.P flinging Devlin into the ocean and crashing Captain Renko on the abandoned dock of Katorga-12</p><h3>Plot</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31169/1522658-katorga_12_coast.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1522658" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.4469696969697" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:44.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31169/1522658-katorga_12_coast.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1522658"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/31169/1522658-katorga_12_coast.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/31169/1522658-katorga_12_coast.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">At the beginning of the story in Singularity, the player finds himself in the shoes of Nathaniel Renko, a U.S. black ops soldier who has been sent with his partner James Devlin to investigate the mysterious Katorga-12. The CIA have recently found strange signals coming from it. As the chopper circles the island, it crashes on the edge of the island after a mysterious release of energy. After Renko recovers from the crash, he quickly proceeds to regroup with Devlin in a nearby abandoned school.</p><p style="">However, as he travels through the island, Renko suddenly gets caught in a time paradox that sends him to a burning building on Katorga in the 1950s as a mysterious catastrophe shakes the island. As Renko proceeds through the building, he finds a man hanging on the brink of death in the fire, and quickly proceeds to rescue him. When Renko returns to the present, he realizes that something has changed, since the island becomes filled with statues and iconography of the man he rescued.</p><p style="">After reuniting with Devlin, Renko is ambushed by a huge force of modern Russian spetsnaz. With fire being opened upon them, Renko and Devlin try to escape, but nonetheless get captured and are confronted by a mysterious Russian general. After a short meeting with him, Devlin winds up dead, since the general personally shoots him, and Renko gets rescued by a woman named Kathryn Norvikova.</p><p style="">Katheryn sheds some light on what's going on, saying she works for a group named Mir 12, and explains to Renko that Russia gained a colossal military superiority over everyone else in the Cold War after discovering the mysterious mineral E99 on Katorga. Using E99 powered weapons on the battlefield, the Soviet Union quickly took over the world, led by Doctor Demichev, a key figure who operated on Katorga 12 in the 50s. Katherine informs you that he was helped by Doctor Barisov, a man with good intents who was the only one capable of stopping Demichev, but was shot by the latter during the fall of Katorga. In order to save Barisov from his death in the past, Katherine sends you to find the TMD, or the Time Manipulation Device, which is capable of rewinding time and is possibly the most fierce weapon ever invented.</p><p style="">Upon finding the TMD, Renko quickly proceeds to meet up with Barisov in the 50s, and rescue him from his death by Demichev's hands. Upon meeting Demichev, Renko recognizes that Demichev looks vaguely like the man he rescued in the burning building, but pays little attention to that fact. After rescuing Doctor Barisov, Renko then travels backwards and forwards through time under Barisov's and Katherine's instructions. Although Renko continues discovering more and more grizzly details of the catastrophe that took place on Katorga, his main objective is to find and arm the E99 bomb, a weapon of mass destruction that Barisov believes will wipe Katorga from existence before the utilization of E99 for Demichev's needs to take over the world.</p><p style="">After spending most of the game preparing the bomb, Renko then places it in the center of Katorga in the building that is producing the Singularity, the disruption of time that is responsible for all the anomalies on the island, as well as the catastrophe that took place in the 50s. However, upon placing the bomb, Renko finds that it simply disappears without causing any damage, at which point Demichev finally catches up to you and attempts to kill you and Barisov. He tells you that no matter how many times Renko and Barisov attempted to stop the Singularity, they failed every time, since Demichev has been rescued by Renko from death in a burning building in one of the time lines, allowing him to continue keeping the Singularity alive.</p><h3>Endings</h3><p style="">As a result, in the end, Renko has the choice to kill Demichev, travel back in time to the flaming building, and kill his other self that is rescuing Demichev in order to ensure the Singularity never happens. If the player chooses that course of action, he finds himself living in an idealistic Soviet society that still has taken over the world, but is instead led by the noble ideas of Doctor Barisov.</p><p style="">Another option is to shoot Barisov, and then be bestowed all the gifts promised to you by Demichev as a reward. This ending shows Renko leading Demichev's fearless troops across the world, with the TMD in your hand making you the most powerful soldier on the battlefield. However, as you continue getting power, a chasm develops between you and Demichev, and by the end, two Soviet factions appear on the verge on conflict: one in the United States led by Demichev, and another in Russia led by Renko. As a result, the world finds itself on the brink of another Cold War.</p><p style="">In the final ending option, you can kill both men, and leave, mysteriously disappearing. The deaths of both potential leaders for the Soviet empire cause it to collapse into hundreds of warring states, leading the world into anarchy as chaos ensues worldwide. The ending concludes with an implication that someone is trying to restore the American White House, and potentially trying to re-create the country.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="right" data-size="medium" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11986/2471940-image.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2471940" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.53067484662577" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:53.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11986/2471940-image.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2471940"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11986/2471940-image.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11986/2471940-image.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Singularity is a linear first person shooter that has players traversing through a destroyed Katorga-12 in the year 2010, periodically traveling through time to a 1950s state of the island, specifically when everything began to fall apart. Players do battle against Soviet troops from the present and past as well as mutated creatures, the aftermath of the cataclysmic event. A variety of weapons are available, from the standard assault rifle and shotgun to more unique weaponry such as the Seeker, a semi automatic rifle that allows the player to guide each bullet to a target. Throughout the game the player can upgrade their weapons and TMD device.</p><p style="">The collapse of the Katorga-12 operation in the 1950s has led to random time warps and rifts that occur throughout the island. With these, the player will be forced into or voluntarily enter the 1950s and back respectively. After acquiring the hand-mounted TMD device, the player can manipulate objects, the environment, and enemies by aging or reverting them. For example, a broken staircase can be mended by warping it back to its 1950s state, enemies can be killed by aging them into dust, and more.</p><p style="">Similar to Bioshock, the player can learn more about what happened to Katorga-12 by listening to audio logs left behind by its inhabitants and researchers. However, these audio logs cannot be picked up, so the player must stand near them to hear it.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><h3>Main Weapons</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1776716-8.png" data-ref-id="1300-1776716" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.78936170212766" data-width="470" style="width: 470px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:78.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1776716-8.png" data-ref-id="1300-1776716"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4527/1776716-8.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4527/1776716-8.png"></noscript></a></figure><p style=""><b>Centurion</b></p><p style="">Six round revolver that does small damage despite shooting E99 slugs.

It can be noted that the rifle does more damage when time is slowed down. Generally, while the sniper rifle is not particularly useful in most shootouts, it is worth considering upgrading because of the high amounts of damage it causes, which can be useful against the more powerful enemies.</p><p style=""><b>Autocannon</b></p><p style="">If bluntly described, it is in essence a minigun. Found towards the middle of the game, it is advised to exploit it as much as possible for the rest of the trip, since it is similar in behavior to the Valkyrie, but has a much larger magazine and does far more damage upon upgrade. Highly advised to prioritize when distributing tech points.</p><p style=""><b>Spikeshot</b></p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1776721-13.png" data-ref-id="1300-1776721" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.78678038379531" data-width="469" style="width: 469px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:78.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1776721-13.png" data-ref-id="1300-1776721"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4527/1776721-13.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4527/1776721-13.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Dethex Launcher</figcaption></figure><p style="">Generally, very powerful railgun that deals large amounts of damage. Particularly useful, since it highlights the heat signatures of all enemies in dark areas, but has a large disadvantage in the fact that it</p><p style="">takes a small amount of time to charge upon before shooting. Generally, similarly to the Kasimov, it is not generally advised to upgrade the Spikshot before some other guns, seeing as to the fact that is has a very specific use. However, the one hit kill for most enemies could be a strong bargain.</p><p style=""><b>Dethex Launcher</b></p><p style="">Special purpose explosive/grenade launcher. It can either act as a typical grenade launcher with a large magazine, it also deploys a bomb that could be controlled manually. Generally inadvisable to upgrade, since it is very hard to find ammo for it, and because the special guided bomb ability is rarely used due to intensity of the combat.</p><h3>Special Weapons</h3><p style=""><b>Seeker</b></p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1776714-7.png" data-ref-id="1300-1776714" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.78723404255319" data-width="470" style="width: 470px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:78.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1776714-7.png" data-ref-id="1300-1776714"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4527/1776714-7.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4527/1776714-7.png"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">A highly powerful gun that shoots one bullet at a time, but it is a one hit kill for all enemies other than bosses. Due to the fact that the bullet is explosive, it deals massive damage to everyone. What makes it even more devastating on the battlefield, is the fact that you can control the trajectory of every bullet from third person view, assuring you can kill enemies hiding behind cover. Due to the amount of damage it does, it cannot be upgraded, and can only be used in certain parts of the game.</p><p style=""><b>RLS-7</b></p><p style="">All The RLS-7 can only be picked up from fallen enemies, and then be used only for a couple shots. Acting as a typical rocket launcher, it does colossal amounts of damage, but has very scarce ammunition and takes a long time to re-load. Cannot be upgraded. weapons except the Seeker and the Rocket Launcher may be upgraded through the player's weapon locker using found weapon tech. It should also be noted that the Seeker and the Rocket Launcher are not available in the player's weapon locker.</p><h2>Powers</h2><ul><li><b>Age/Renew</b> - Probably the most necessary mechanic in the game, at least for the puzzles. This gives the player the ability to age/crush/destroy certain objects in the environment, or bring them back to a pristine state. The player can also age enemies to dust with this ability.</li><li><b>Impulse</b> - As soon as the player obtains the TMD, this ability replaces the player's knife as melee. Knocks back enemies and instantly kills weaker enemies.</li><li><b>Grav Manipulation</b> - Allows the player to catch/pickup/throw/put-down certain objects in the environment. One can also steal shields for enemies using this ability. Essentially this game's version of the Gravity Gun</li><li><b>Deadlock -</b> Creates a bubble in which time practically stops. While the bubble expires in a fairly short amount of time, this ability can break the game if used too often.</li><li><b>Reversion -</b> Turns late-game enemies into blind, vomiting, vicious monsters who attack anything that makes noise. Age them once more to turn them into walking bombs.</li></ul><p style="">All of these powers use E99 energy, although some (Age on an enemy, Reversion, Impulse) consume far more resources than others.</p><h2>Multiplayer</h2><p style="">The game features two multiplayer game types: Extermination and Monsters vs. Soldiers. Multiplayer is class-based. Two rounds make up a match.</p><p style=""><b>Extermination</b> features a team of soldiers who must renew beacons and defend them for 20 seconds. The other team, the monsters, must stop them. There is a time limit of five minutes per beacon. 3 beacons make the match.</p><p style=""><b>Monsters vs. Soldiers</b> is essentially team death match which features a team of soldiers vs. a team of monster.</p><h3><u>Soldier Classes</u></h3><ul><li><b>Blitzer</b> - The Blitzer has the ability to teleport short distances at cost of E99 energy. Not only does this allow for use of shortcuts and passages that would otherwise be unusable, but it can also be a powerful weapon as teleporting into an enemy usually results in an instant kill.</li><li><b>Bruiser</b> - The Bruiser is able to use the Impulse ability. Great for those pesky Phase Ticks!</li><li><b>Healer</b> - The Healer has the ability to heal others (and thusly, heal himself). A great support character.</li><li><b>Lurker</b> - The Lurker has access to the shield ability. The shield ability absorbs a percentage of damage and, if the player stands still while the ability is active, they will be granted temporary "invisibility".</li></ul><p style="">All soldiers also have access to the Centurion and one other weapon of the player's choice that is chosen through the loadout screen.</p><h3><u>Monster Classes</u></h3><ul><li><b>Revert</b> - A slow monster, but a powerhouse. Melee strength is high. Has the ability to vomit on enemies to damage them and slow them down (or vomit on friendlies to heal them), lay down 2 bile mines at a time.</li><li><b>Zek</b> - A quick, sneaky monster. Has the ability to spawn explosive barrels to throw at enemies, temporarily go invisible/invulnerable, execute a powerful ground stomp.</li><li><b>Radion</b> - Tank of the monster team. An arachnid-like creature with heavy armor on the front of its body. Can fire powerful fire balls and bouncing spikes.</li><li><b>Phase Tick</b> - A weak monster with great potential. Can hop onto enemies and possess them. Also can detonate torso to kill enemies (without necessarily killing oneself).</li></ul><h2>PC System Requirements</h2><ul><li><ul><li><strong>Operating System:</strong> Windows® XP/Vista/Windows 7

violent gameplay of <a href="/postal-2/3030-12863/" data-ref-id="3030-12863">Postal 2</a> in a new city called Catharsis. The game was developed using the <a href="/valve-corporation/3010-1374/" data-ref-id="3010-1374">Valve</a> <a href="/source-engine/3015-751/" data-ref-id="3015-751">Source Engine</a>. Unlike the previous game, Postal III is played from a third-person perspective and replaces that game's open world sandbox for a series of open-ended missions based along branching narrative paths. The game features appearances from low-tier celebrities such as film director <a href="/uwe-boll/3040-90432/" data-ref-id="3040-90432">Uwe Boll</a> and porn star <a href="/ron-jeremy/3040-97240/" data-ref-id="3040-97240">Ron Jeremy</a>.</p><p style=""> </p><h2>Development and Release</h2><p style="">The game had long been in <a href="/development-hell/3015-1339/" data-ref-id="3015-1339">development hell</a> and this shows in the myriad of bugs and glitches in the final product. Perhaps because of this, the game was initially released in 2011 but only in Russia, a <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/steam/3015-718/" data-ref-id="3015-718">Steam </a>release was planned but was delayed and Steam, at one point, deleted the game from it's listings.</p><p style="">Under it's initial release the game received mostly negative reaction from fans and Runnning With Scissors eventually pulled the release and encouraged would be buyers to purchase earlier Postal games. It later came to light that Running With Scissors had outsourced the production of the game to a Russian game company who failed to satisfy RWS's standard.</p><p style="">The game was eventually released to Steam in early 2013.A version was in development for the PS3 and the Xbox 360: the fate of those ports are unknown.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style="">Postal III follows <a href="/the-postal-dude/3005-544/" data-ref-id="3005-544">Postal Dude Jr.'s</a> failed one-day career in video game development (Postal 2) and the ensuing "accidental" nuclear destruction of Paradise, Arizona ( <a href="/postal-2-apocalypse-weekend/3030-18837/" data-ref-id="3030-18837">Apocalypse Weekend</a>). Following a brief prologue that recaps the events of Postal 2, the story follows the Postal Dude and his psychotic pit bull <a href="/champ-the-dog/3005-5609/" data-ref-id="3005-5609">Champ</a> as they emigrate to the town of Catharsis. Unfortunately, due to the global economic meltdown, left-wing "green" extremism and hypocritical right-wing government corruption, life in Catharsis isn't much better.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22269/2136386-2012_02_23_00030.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2136386" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22269/2136386-2012_02_23_00030.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2136386"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22269/2136386-2012_02_23_00030.jpg"></a><figcaption>Tasing hockey moms as a bodyguard of Jennifer Walcott</figcaption></figure><p style="">Postal III is set against the backdrop of a satirically broken US economy where gas costs $17 a gallon and Mexico is forced to patrol its borders to prevent Americans from illegally jumping the fence looking for jobs and healthcare. Meanwhile, the Dude stumbles from one disastrous temp job to the next, Just trying to make ends meet. Over the course of the game, he crosses paths with eco-zealots, "Hockey Moms," offensively stereotypical gay Segway "biker" gangs, deranged fast food mascots, corrupt government officials, Al Qaeda, the Venezuelan army and even a meth-crazed rhino.But there are choices to be made. Will the Dude follow the path of Good, joining the Catharsis police department to protect and serve? Or will he tap fresh new veins of crazy and find himself hunted and hounded by all?</p><h2>Characters &amp; Factions</h2><ul><li>The Postal Dude</li><li>Champ the dog</li><li>Ron J</li><li>Uncle Dave</li><li>Jennifer Walcott the pornstar</li><li>Krotchy the ballsack mascot</li><li>Al and the Ecotologists</li><li>Bin-Laden and Al-Qaeda</li><li>Hockey Moms</li><li>Catharsis PD</li><li>DEA</li><li>Gay Segway Biker Gang</li></ul><h2>Level Design/Missions</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22269/2136371-2012_02_24_00030.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2136371" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22269/2136371-2012_02_24_00030.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2136371"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22269/2136371-2012_02_24_00030.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22269/2136371-2012_02_24_00030.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The typical initial screen of a mission</figcaption></figure><p style="">The game is very story driven, and every level consists of a mission that begins with a cutscene and ends with one as well. While it's still possible to treat the game as a sandbox mayhem game and free roam around the current level causing mayhem, the game is always waiting for the player to finish the task at hand, whether it's a fetch quest or a kill mission with a counter, in order to play the next cutscene, progress the story and move on to the next area. Which means that traveling from one town to another is not an option, it's only done when the missions of said town are all finished.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22269/2136384-2012_02_24_00143.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2136384" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22269/2136384-2012_02_24_00143.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2136384"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22269/2136384-2012_02_24_00143.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22269/2136384-2012_02_24_00143.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Dude taking cover during a prison break</figcaption></figure><p style="">Postal III is arguably a cover-based third person shooter; however despite the game's tips and level design which encourage hiding behind cover during combat the game can easily, and more enjoyably be played the same way as its predecessor: run and gun.

These various weapons and the variety of ways to use them, whether in long range, medium range or at point blank, make the combat surprisingly more tactical and thoughtful based on the surrounding area, the types of enemies and whether or not the player is surrounded by allies.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><table><tbody><tr><th>Weapon</th><th>Image</th><th>Type</th><th>Uses</th></tr><tr><td>Pistol</td><td>firearm</td><td>mid-long range shooting</td></tr><tr><td>M16 Assault Rifle</td><td>firearm</td><td>mid-long range shooting</td></tr><tr><td>Shotgun</td><td>firearm</td><td>close range shooting</td></tr><tr><td>Machine Gun</td><td>firearm</td><td>mid-long range shooting</td></tr><tr><td>Grenade Launcher</td><td>firearm</td><td>long range shooting</td></tr><tr><td>Grenade</td><td>thrown</td><td>thrown explosive</td></tr><tr><td>Molotov</td><td>thrown</td><td>thrown cocktail that sets enemies on fire</td></tr><tr><td>HIV-infected cats</td><td>thrown</td><td>thrown cats which cling on to people and bite their limbs off</td></tr><tr><td>Bee hive</td><td>thrown</td><td>thrown hives which explode on contact and swarm people with bees</td></tr><tr><td>Machete</td><td>thrown / melee</td><td>can be thrown as a boomerang or used as a melee weapon</td></tr><tr><td>Nailed bat</td><td>melee</td><td>melee weapon</td></tr><tr><td>Police baton</td><td>melee</td><td>melee weapon</td></tr><tr><td>Pepper spray</td><td>spray can</td><td>spray people in the face to choke them or (alt fire) use it as a flame thrower</td></tr><tr><td>Catnip spray</td><td>spray can</td><td>spray it on cats to drug and capture them</td></tr><tr><td>Laser pen</td><td>remote control</td><td>guide your dog Champ to your enemies so he can bite them in the groin</td></tr><tr><td>Gas tank &amp;

A garden is completed by collecting special items known as spectra, generally located far above the player's starting location. This is companied by simple but striking 1080p visuals at 60 frames per second and a techno sound track to create an immersive experience.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/68632/1520746-4b2adb0ed61ee_featured_without_text_baiyon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1520746" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.50207468879668" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:50.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/68632/1520746-4b2adb0ed61ee_featured_without_text_baiyon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1520746"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/68632/1520746-4b2adb0ed61ee_featured_without_text_baiyon.jpg"></a><figcaption>Grimps</figcaption></figure><p style="">Grimps can be controlled by jumping or by launching silk off a plant and rotating around it. The length of silk can also be drawn in. While jumping, the grimp can be made to spin which will prevent it from attaching to plants or rocks, and can be used to destroy certain enemies. Spinning also pulls in pollen from small area around the grimp. Pollen is produced by destroying Pollen Prowlers, which can be done by either hitting them with the body of the grimp or by the silk for the Type A variety. Once they release the pollen, the grimp must collect it by touching it with their body or silk. Collecting pollen causes it to drift toward the closest unpollinated seed or be absorbed if there is not one within a sufficient distance. Once a seed is fully pollinated/charged, it starts glowing, which indicates that it is ready to be opened. When the player makes contact with the seed, it will grow into a plant. The SIXAXIS motion controls can also be used to suddenly project the grimp downward, which results in a greater amount of pollen released from any Pollen Prowlers destroyed on the way down.</p><p style="">There are also two sizes of crystals scattered throughout a garden that refill/tune the player's oscillator bar depending on its size. This bar depletes over time, so gathering these crystals is very important. If it goes out of tune, the level is failed. However, with the first patch you may choose to continue from the last spectra collected, though you forfeit trophies by doing this. Collecting at least five Pollen Prowlers in a single swing will also generate a circle of small crystals which remain for a limited amount of time. The oscillator bar is completely refilled when a spectra is collected.</p><p style="">There are several tougher enemies in the game. Their abilities vary from breaking the silk to bumping the grimp off its path and causing it to spin. Later enemies have advanced abilities such as removing a certain amount from the oscillator bar or causing a plant to simply disappear for a short amount of time.</p><p style="">When a player collects a new spectra it is added to the player's own Eden, which helps to reach gardens that are placed higher up. There are ten gardens with five spectra each, making a total of 50 spectra to collect. Upon the each play through of a garden, only one additional spectra is required to complete it until all five are collected.</p><h2>YouTube</h2><p style="">It is also possible to record in-game footage up to 10 minutes long and upload it directly to YouTube or save it to the PlayStation 3 hard drive.</p><h2>Music</h2><p style="">The soundtrack to PixelJunk Eden was published by ANIPLEX Records and released on September 24th, 2008. It features a mix of ambient and rhythmic music - most songs are very low-key, while others provide a simple beat. The album is available online at certain retailers but can also be purchased for $1.99 from the PSN store. Once the player has attained all 50 spectra, the ability to create custom soundtracks for the game is unlocked.</p><h3>Track Listing</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/68632/1520748-eden.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1520748" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="1" data-width="300" style="width: 300px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/68632/1520748-eden.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1520748"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/68632/1520748-eden.jpg"></a></figure><ol><li>Become Part of This</li><li>637 Volpe</li><li>Board De Lac</li><li>They Said</li><li>Summer in Winter</li><li>Flat Frog</li><li>Swept The Rain</li><li>Wheel Window</li><li>Hand-Wash</li><li>Druck Der Farben</li><li>Return</li><li>3 Across 4</li></ol><h2>Criticism</h2><p style="">An open letter lamenting the difficulty of the game (particularly the enemies and the timer) was responded to by lead developer <a href="/dylan-cuthbert/3040-20801/" data-ref-id="3040-20801">Dylan Cuthbert</a>. Cuthbert felt that the game would be too easy in co-op mode if any changes were made. Nevertheless, Q-games has many ideas for an upcoming expansion pack dubbed PixelJunk Eden Encore. Cuthbert states that "the controls are too much fun to waste on just one set of game rules" and that he is "sure we will try and add a more namby pamby mode for the “lighter” people out there." This expansion was later released, bearing the the same name as previously stated by Cuthbert, PixelJunk Eden Encore. The timer was never addressed and the add-on does not "fix" anything, per se, but simply adds more mechanics.</p><h2>System Requirements</h2><ul><li><strong>OS:</strong>Windows XP, Vista, 7</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong>Performance equivalent to Core™2 Duo.

They further complained that the fat princess could easily be replaced by a box  full of stuff without changing the game mechanics at all; and that "when a human character can be replaced with an inanimate object, there is something wrong with the design." Criticism of these design decisions were also written about on <a href="http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2008/07/fat-princess-update.html" rel="nofollow">                               Shakesville</a> and <a href="http://www.bigfatblog.com/fat-princess" rel="nofollow">                               Big Fat Blog</a>.  None of the sites advocated banning the game.<br /><br />When the game was first released, many players had difficulty finding an online match. This has since been patched.<br /><br /><h2>Classes </h2> <ul class="plain-list"><li><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31999/1099725-fatprincess2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1099725" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.56333333333333" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31999/1099725-fatprincess2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1099725"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/31999/1099725-fatprincess2.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/31999/1099725-fatprincess2.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Worker doing  work</figcaption></figure><b>Worker </b>– The worker is the resource-gathering and builder class in Fat Princess.

The villager attacks with a slap that stuns enemies and forces them to drop anything they are carrying. Unlike the hatted classes, you cannot become a villager through any action other than death, switching teams, or starting a new game.

While the class isn't invincible, it has around two to three times the amount of hearts that the warrior class has and comes equipped with a scythe, killing almost everyone in one hit. You can also play as the Reaper in the single player Gladiate arena during the credits roll.</li><li><b>Giant Chicken</b> – Similarly to the Reaper class, you'll transform into this class if you have the most points at the end of the match.

A team must break into the enemy castle, pick up their own captive princess, and return her to the throne of their castle. Once a team's princess is on the throne while the other team's princess remains captive, a timer will start; should the team hold the princesses for the full length of the timer, they win the round.</li><li> <b>Snatch 'n Grab</b> – A team must break into the enemy castle, pick up their enemy's princess from the throne, and deposit her in the holding area of their own castle. Once captured, the princess will respawn back at her throne. First team to three captures wins.</li><li> <a data-ref-id="3015-2463" href="/team-deathmatch/3015-2463/"> <b>Team Deathmatch</b></a> – Each kill removes one ticket from the other team; first team to lose all their tickets loses the round.</li><li> <b>Invasion </b>– Both teams start with an accumulation of points. Points are removed from the other team when you capture more than half of the outposts on the map. Capturing more outposts makes the point total decrease at a faster rate. The first team to lose all their points loses the round.<br /></li><li><b>Soccer</b> – A special mode only available on the designated Soccer map. You play a game of soccer with the typical rule of getting the ball into the other team's goal without picking it up to score a point for your team. However, that is the only rule. Hats and building materials randomly drop, as well as large bombs and additional balls. Workers can build springboards and static goalies.<br /></li><li> <b>Gladiate </b>– A single player only mode; players are allowed to choose their class and then must fight 12 waves of enemies in an arena setting.<br /></li><li> <b>Legend Of The Fat Princess</b> – A single player story mode with seven chapters that encompasses most of the other game types.</li></ul><br /><h2>Additional Content </h2><h3>New Pork (level)<br /></h3>At PAX 2009, Titan Studios unveiled a new city-themed level they will be adding to Fat Princess soon. The map seems to have multiple planes in which players can use to attack each other. The map features multiple sewer shortcuts, for the subterranean players, a slew of barricades players can blow up for those that prefer ground level, and rooftop access, allowing players to take to the sky to get the job done. The name appears to be a pun on the popular city "New York," fitting with the game's cartoonish and satirical aesthetic. This became available for free as part of the 1.03 update.<br /><br /><h3>Brownie Town (level)<br /></h3>Announced on January 20, 2010 on the US PlayStation Blog that a village-themed level would be released as part of the 1.04 patch. The level along with the rest of the patch was released on January 21. <br /><br /><h3>Patch 1.05</h3>Patch 1.05 was released on March 25, 2010 and includes two new snow-themed maps, “Candy Mountain” and “Frost Bite". The new maps also contain  new gameplay features including slippy ice physics and destructible  pathways.]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>21184</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/0/5150/1100414-fatprincesslogo.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5150/1100414-fatprincesslogo.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/0/5150/1100414-fatprincesslogo.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5150/1100414-fatprincesslogo.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/5150/1100414-fatprincesslogo.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5150/1100414-fatprincesslogo.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/0/5150/1100414-fatprincesslogo.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Fat Princess]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>22</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-1/]]></api_detail_url><id>1</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: T]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-2/]]></api_detail_url><id>2</id><name><![CDATA[PEGI: 16+]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2009-07-30 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-88/]]></api_detail_url><id>88</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation Network (PS3)]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-network-ps3/3045-88/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3N]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/fat-princess/3030-21184/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21210/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-07-21 15:55:45</date_added><date_last_updated>2013-02-18 02:41:11</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[Conan is an action adventure game that has you slicing and dicing your way through hordes of enemies. ]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2> Conan is an action-adventure game published by <a data-ref-id="3010-15" href="/thq/3010-15/" slug="thq">                                  THQ</a> in 2007 for<a data-ref-id="3045-35" href="/playstation-3/3045-35/" slug="playstation-3">       Playstation 3</a>, and <a data-ref-id="3045-20" href="/xbox-360/3045-20/" slug="xbox-360">     Xbox 360</a>.

The people of this time have given up many of their freedoms to attain a state of peace and comfort. More specifically, since the flow of information is mainly technological, it is easily monitored by the totalitarian government. That's where <a href="/faith/3005-1422/" data-ref-id="3005-1422">Faith</a>, the main character, and the other Runners come in.</p><p style="">A certain group of people didn't like the way things were changing in the city and were pushed to the fringe of society. Instead of communicating by more modern means, they hire Runners to get information from one place to another without "Big Brother" seeing what's being passed along. Runners are usually left alone, but at the beginning of the story, the government begins to criminalize the Runners and hunt them down.</p><p style="">The game starts off with Faith having to deliver a package to a fellow runner, <a href="/celeste/3005-8397/" data-ref-id="3005-8397">Celeste</a>. She is guided through this level, as she is in most others, by a man named <a href="/mercury/3005-8188/" data-ref-id="3005-8188">Merc</a>. He keeps in touch with her from a distant hideout (aptly named Merc's Lair), gives her assignments and often relays information to Faith. The first level mainly serves as the tutorial and has Faith being hunted down by the police. She escapes and returns to Merc's lair. She listens to the police radios and hears that shots have been fired in the building where her sister <a href="/kate-connors/3005-12825/" data-ref-id="3005-12825">Kate</a>, a police officer, currently is. Faith finds Kate in the office of a politician named Pope. When Faith arrives, she discovers that Pope has been murdered and that Kate has been framed. While looking for clues, Faith discovers that Pope was clutching a piece of paper with the words "Icarus to the highest" written on it. The cops arrive and Kate surrenders herself Faith can escape. Faith escapes by sliding down the side of a building while dodging helicopter gun fire, jumps onto train tracks, crashes through a glass ceiling and then meets with another runner.</p><p style="">Faith makes it back to Merc's lair alarmed and wondering why the cops are on high alert. Despite Faith not wanting to meet him, she comes into contact with <a href="/jacknife/3005-12826/" data-ref-id="3005-12826">Jacknife</a>, a former runner now turned informant for Merc, who tells Faith that he has intel that might link Pope's murder to his security guard, an ex-wrestler named <a href="/ropeburn/3005-13214/" data-ref-id="3005-13214">Ropeburn</a>. Before paying a visit to Ropeburn, Faith meets <a href="/miller/3005-13887/" data-ref-id="3005-13887">Lt. Miller</a> in a parking lot to try and convince him to help Kate. Lt. Miller, also Kate's superior, knows that she is innocent but because of pressure coming from his superiors, he is powerless to do anything. Faith knows that Kate doesn't stand a chance in jail and questions Miller about Icarus who doesn't give her an answer. After this, Faith runs off.</p><p style="">Faith infiltrates Ropeburn's office and overhears him on the phone, realizing that he's the one who framed her sister and that he's setting up a meeting downtown. Faith once again meets Miller to tell him this. Miller pulls a gun on her, telling her that he's being pressured by private firms who want to install more security on the city and that the only way he can get them of his back is to hand her over. Faith escapes and goes to the meeting. She gets the upper hand and interrogates Ropeburn. As he's hanging off the ledge of the skyscraper, he's shot by a masked sniper before he can tell Faith any pertinent information. She later intercepts Jacknife, convinced that he was the one who tipped off the cops that she was coming. He rejects the accusation, saying that if he had wanted her dead he would have done it himself.</p><p style="">With Ropeburn dead, Faith is out of leads. She decides to investigate Pirandello/Kruger, a security firm that provides the city with its security and is also helping the police fight the runners. While investigating in their offices near the docks, Faith discovers that they are the ones behind Project Icarus, which is meant to train the police forces in parkour to fight the runners. She also discovers that Ropeburn's killer is hiding in the docks, and after fighting him, it's revealed that it is Celeste, who has been a part of Icarus. She chose Icarus to keep herself safe and strongly advises Faith to do the same. She also reveals that she killed Pope because he was beginning to question the security firms.</p><p style="">Faith escapes and discovers that Kate has been tried and found guilty for the murder. She's being moved to prison by convoy which Faith promptly intercepts. She saves Kate and leads the police away to allow time for Kate to get away. After losing the cops, Faith makes her way to Merc's lair. The lair has been raided by the police, taking Kate and killing Merc. With his last breath, Merc tells Faith that Kate has been taken to the Shard, the city's highest tower. The Mayor's office as well as most of the city's security is headquartered within the building. Faith manages to destroy the servers housing security information thanks to the help of Miller. She then makes it to the roof where she finds Jacknife holding Kate at gunpoint. Jacknife reveals that he's been with Icarus all along and was being used as bait to lure out the runners. As he is about to escape with Kate on a helicopter, Faith jumps onto the helicopter, kicks Jacknife off the helicopter and to his doom. Faith and Kate both escape safely and stand atop the building, overlooking the city.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">Despite taking place in the first-person, Mirror's Edge takes the emphasis off gun wielding and focuses more on movement and momentum. As Faith runs she continually picks up speed. This speed allows her to pull of some of the more difficult acrobatic maneuvers, as well as perform the simpler ones without losing much momentum. Finding ways to retain that momentum is one the main challenges of the game.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/207551-122.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-207551" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/207551-122.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-207551"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3699/207551-122.jpg"></a><figcaption>Everything is performed from a first-person perspective.</figcaption></figure><p style="">On the consoles, the game is controlled by a combination of three buttons and the left stick, making the controls rather simple, although there are layers of complexity. Jumping and climbing over objects is done with the left bumper (L1 on PS3), while ducking and sliding under objects is done with the left trigger. The right bumper (R1 on PS3) allows you to perform a 180 degree spin, for quick turnaround. Those three buttons in combination with the left thumbstick can control most of the gameplay, with other buttons related to combat and Reaction Time (bullet-time).</p><p style="">The game's producer, Nick Channon, said in an interview with Gametrailers.com that each level of the game will present the player with a few ways to get through any given area and it's up to the player to find his/her own fastest way over/under/around each obstacle laid before him.</p><p style="">To aid in this decision making process, the game uses a color coding system called "Runner Vision." Objects in the environment necessary to complete certain areas or perform certain movements are painted red, though this can be turned off on higher difficulty settings.</p><p style="">Faith is not armed by default. She can remove guns from enemies by force, but is unable to run while wielding them.</p><p style="">The melee combat system in the game is based on momentum as well. The more speed you have going at an enemy, the more effectively you'll be able to disarm and remove the enemy from your list of troubles.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><p style="">Despite the fact that Mirror's Edge is primarily a "free running" game, there are still a variety of weapons the player can use to dispose of opponents, if he/she chooses to do so. There is one specific achievement in the game that encourages players to never fire a single shot during an entire playthrough of the game.</p><h3>Machine Guns</h3><ul><li><a href="/m249-saw/3055-623/" data-ref-id="3055-623">M249</a></li></ul><h3>Rifles</h3><ul><li><a href="/fn-scar/3055-790/" data-ref-id="3055-790">FN SCAR</a></li><li><a href="/hk-g36/3055-1879/" data-ref-id="3055-1879">H&amp;K G36C</a></li></ul><h3>Sniper Rifles</h3><ul><li><a href="/barrett-m95/3055-1336/" data-ref-id="3055-1336">Barrett M95</a></li></ul><h3>Shotguns</h3><ul><li><a href="/benelli-m3-super-90/3055-2755/" data-ref-id="3055-2755">Benelli M3 Super 90</a></li><li><a href="/neostead-2000/3055-1356/" data-ref-id="3055-1356">Neostead 2000</a></li></ul><h3>Submachine Guns</h3><ul><li><a href="/ruger-mp9/3055-2752/" data-ref-id="3055-2752">B&amp;T MP9</a></li><li><a href="/mp5/3055-289/" data-ref-id="3055-289">H&amp;K MP5</a></li></ul><h3>Pistols</h3><ul><li><a href="/m1911/3055-61/" data-ref-id="3055-61">Colt M1911</a></li><li><a href="/m9-pistol/3055-940/" data-ref-id="3055-940">Beretta 92</a></li><li><a href="/glock-18/3055-1050/" data-ref-id="3055-1050">Glock 18</a></li></ul><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><ul><li><a href="/taser/3055-748/" data-ref-id="3055-748">Taser</a></li></ul><h2>Chapters</h2><p style="">Mirror's Edge story is divided into 9 Chapters plus a Prologue.</p><ul><li><strong>Prologue - </strong>The Edge</li><li><strong>Chapter 1 - </strong>Flight</li><li><strong>Chapter 2 - </strong>Jackknife</li><li><strong>Chapter 3 - </strong>Heat</li><li><strong>Chapter 4 - </strong>Ropeburn</li><li><strong>Chapter 5 - </strong>New Eden</li><li><strong>Chapter 6 - </strong>Pirandello Kruger</li><li><strong>Chapter 7 - </strong>The Boat</li><li><strong>Chapter 8 - </strong>Kate</li><li><strong>Chapter 9 - </strong>The Shard</li></ul><h2>Controls</h2><p style="">The normal first-person controls are mostly intact, but there is one major difference. The left bumper and left trigger (or L1 and L2 on the PS3) are designated as up and down, respectively. These buttons control all of the player's acrobatics. This control structure is designed to give the player ease of control while still leaving skill in the mix, mostly in terms of timed button presses. For example: when taking a leap over a gap to a lower platform you have to press down right when you hit the ground to do a roll to maintain momentum and save your knees.</p><p style="">Mirror's Edge also takes advantage of the PS3 Sixaxis controls, with various motions corresponding with actions. Rolling the controller can be used to roll after a long fall, and twisting the controller can take an enemy weapon.</p><p style="">When faced with a waist-high obstruction you can press up to vault over it or, in the case of there being a hole underneath, down to slide under.</p><h3>Default Controls</h3><ul><li><b>L1 / LB</b> / <b>Space Bar</b>: Jump / Grab onto poles / Climb / Wallrun</li><li><b>L2 / LT / Shift Key</b>: Soft landing / Slide</li><li><b>R2 / RT / Left Click</b>: Fight / Shoot / Smash doors open</li><li><b>Circle / B / Left Alt:</b> Aim toward objective / Hint</li><li><b>Square / X</b> / <b>R key</b>: Slow-Motion (Runner Vision)</li><li><b>Triangle / Y</b> / <b>Right Click</b>: Disarm (only when enemy is facing away from Faith or their weapon turns red)</li><li><b>X / A / E key</b>: Action button (pressing buttons, etc.)</li><li><b>Left Analog Stick / W A S D</b>: Walk / Run</li><li><b>Right Analog Stick</b> / <b>Mouse</b>: Camera</li></ul><h2>Game Modes</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2488/719068-me8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-719068" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2488/719068-me8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-719068"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2488/719068-me8.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2488/719068-me8.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Time Trial Mode.</figcaption></figure><p style="">While Mirror's Edge's main focus is on the single-player campaign, there is "a semi-multiplayer" component. Time Trial levels are unlocked through progress in the story mode and the idea behind them is to complete a section of a level (not necessarily taking the same route as the level it was lifted from) going down a prescribed route in the fastest time possible. If connected to PSN or Xbox Live, the completion time is uploaded and can be used by other players to race against. In turn, their <a href="/ghost-racer/3015-3097/" data-ref-id="3015-3097">ghost times</a> can be downloaded for your use.</p><p style="">The player sees a series of <a href="http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/2488/719072-me3.jpg" rel="nofollow">red checkpoint markers</a> that tell them where they're supposed to go, and a red figure represents the ghost data that gives you an indication of how well you're doing in any given Time Trial level. Loading up ghost racers can also give you a chance to see how others managed to get their times and how they handled certain sections of a level, a very useful feature for those trying to squeeze out the best time. Each Time Trial stage has a qualifying time, which if achieved, grants the player one star. If even faster times are achieved then two or even three stars are awarded for the level.</p><p style="">There is also a Speed Run mode, in which one is tasked with completing a whole chapter of the campaign under a stringent time limit. It usually requires a flawless run with no falls to finish them under par time.</p><h2>Downloadable Content</h2><p style="">Mirror's Edge downloadable content is available for purchase for all three versions of the game. The new content was originally scheduled for release on January 29th, 2009, but later delayed until February. Players are challenged to achieve the fastest times possible on nine races, across seven all new Time Trial maps with an all new, abstract design. There are no guns, police, or city environment. The pack is available for US $9.99 or 800 Microsoft points, and all PlayStation 3 owners are able to download an additional, exclusive map for free.</p><h2>Limited Edition</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/63119/1448395-fgirndvsnr1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1448395" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.57525773195876" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:57.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/63119/1448395-fgirndvsnr1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1448395"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/63119/1448395-fgirndvsnr1.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/63119/1448395-fgirndvsnr1.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Limited Edition Bag.</figcaption></figure><p style="">EA teamed up with Timbuk2 to create the "Limited Edition Mirror's Edge Runner's Bag Bundle," which included a copy of the game with a Timbuk2 brand messenger bag.

Only 200 were made, and the bundles were sold for $130.</p><h2>Comic Book</h2><p style="">DICE announced during Comic Con 2008 that it would create a <a href="/mirrors-edge/3030-21213/comic-con-preview-comic/52-105544/" data-ref-id="3030-21213">limited comic book</a>, together with DC Comics division and WildStorm.

The game would still focus on multiplayer as with the rest of the series. Continuing in the vein of <a href="/timesplitters-future-perfect/3030-8099/" data-ref-id="3030-8099">Timesplitters: Future Perfect</a>, Timesplitters 4 would also contain a fully-featured single player campaign.
