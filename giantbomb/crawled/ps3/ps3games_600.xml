Though like most survival horror titles, Resident Evil limits the player character's capabilities beyond the norm and ammunition for their firearms is generally scarce, intended to force players to use their supplies wisely and to choose flight rather than fight when possible. There are three different difficulty modes available: Easy, Normal, and Hard, with each one featuring tougher enemies and less ammunition to be found than the last.</p><p style="">Utilising the notorious ''<a href="/tank-controls/3015-4647/" data-ref-id="3015-4647">tank controls</a>'', players move via a third person perspective throughout a number of pre-determined camera angles. Characters also cannot move and fire their weapons at the same time, and instead the character will 'perch' themselves to the ground when aiming. And while the camera angle perspective sometimes tends to purposely obfuscate the players view of monsters, characters will at least (by default) aim their weapon at the closest enemy when players draw their gun. What is new over the original Resident Evil is the ability to now do an 180 degree turn, which was first introduced in <a href="/resident-evil-3-nemesis/3030-5587/" data-ref-id="3030-5587">Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</a> and has continued as a mainstay across the series since then.</p><p style="">While the game follows a linear pattern of major events, the player is allowed to explore most of the beginning mansion at will. Many of the puzzles and necessary key items required to move on can be solved/collected in any order.</p><p style="">The story is largely portrayed via in-game cutscenes, however there are also a number of Files (diaries, memos ect.) players can collect. These will often provide additional insight into the goings on across the overall narrative, but some are more vital as they will provide information pertaining to solving puzzles or maybe hinting as to where to go next.</p><h3>Playable Characters</h3><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8497/236034-character_select2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-236034" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8497/236034-character_select2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-236034"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8497/236034-character_select2.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8497/236034-character_select2.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Chris Redfield</figcaption></figure><p style="">Like the original, Resident Evil features two different characters--Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine--to select from. Each offers up a differing take on the same narrative, though what separates them the most is the gameplay implications, as Jill Valentine's version of the game is significantly easier and more accessible than Chris's.</p><p style="">Jill has more inventory space to carry items; she can potentially find an additional weapon exclusive only to her story, being the grenade launcher; she has with her a lockpick that can open locked drawers; and many more such examples. However Chris is somewhat sturdier than Jill and can withstand more damage before succumbing to death, and he also has better accuracy with handguns giving players the increased chance to pop a zombie's head completely just with one shot.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8497/236033-character_select1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-236033" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8497/236033-character_select1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-236033"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8497/236033-character_select1.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8497/236033-character_select1.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Jill Valentine</figcaption></figure><p style="">Each character also has their own unique supporting character that they will often encounter and interact with during the game. Jill Valentine has with her fellow STARS Alpha team member Barry Burton, whereas Chris has the rookie medic of STARS Bravo team, Rebecca Chambers. Both Barry and Rebecca will sometimes have to help the player character from a perilous situation, though Barry will always be an NPC. During Chris' story, however, players may take control of Rebecca Chambers on two separate occasions to help save Chris from dying of poison, and to kill the mutated plant monster Plant 42.</p><h3>Inventory</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661793-resident_evil_directors_cut_psx_21.png" data-ref-id="1300-2661793" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="300" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 300px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661793-resident_evil_directors_cut_psx_21.png" data-ref-id="1300-2661793"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661793-resident_evil_directors_cut_psx_21.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661793-resident_evil_directors_cut_psx_21.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Chris Redfield's 6-slot inventory screen</figcaption></figure><p style="">Depending on which character the player chooses, they will either have six (Chris) or eight (Jill) inventory slots in total. Each type of item requires only one slot, however. Each character also one additional slot strictly to house a unique item; Chris possesses a lighter, and Jill has a lockpick. Besides the character's inventory, there also exist a number of <a href="/item-box/3055-6126/" data-ref-id="3055-6126">item boxes</a> where players can store unwanted items. Item boxes are often located within save rooms (though not always) and items will persist throughout all item boxes across the game.</p><p style="">All items and weapons can be examined by the player, allowing them to get a closer look and turn the object around. This can sometimes change the properties of certain key items, such as unlocking/opening a key item to reveal another inside, or may at least change the title to reflect the item's true identity.</p><h3>Self-Defense Items</h3><p style="">One notable feature exclusive to the remake is the addition of self-defense items. Given a separate inventory slot, there are three different self-defense items that players may find and then equip. Once one is equipped, from that point when a player is grabbed by an enemy, the player can then press the firing button which will then show the character using the self-defense item to escape the grab, canceling out any possible damage inflicted upon the character. All self-defense items are one use only, however.</p><p style="">There are three different self-defense items, one of which can be found by both characters, and one unique item for each:</p><ul><li><b>Daggers</b> - Can be found during both Chris and Jill's and will inflict moderate damage unto an enemy. There's a small chance that when the enemy has been shot, the dagger will fall onto the ground and can be collected once again by the player.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Flashbang</b> - Chris' exclusive self-defense item, Chris will shove the flashbang into the attacking enemy's mouth and, once shot by the player, will explode killing the creature completely.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Taser</b> - Jill's exclusive self-defense item, Jill will pull out the taser and then zap the enemy doing a high amount of damage. It will kill a zombie outright, though sturdier enemies such as hunters can sometimes manage to survive the current.</li></ul><h3>Health &amp; Herbs/First Aid Sprays</h3><p style="">A character's health can be seen via the inventory menu, with an Electrocardiograph Machine showing a character's status. The different statuses are:</p><ul><li><strong>Fine</strong> - The character is in good health.</li><li><strong>Caution</strong> - The character is roughly at half health.</li><li><strong>Danger</strong> - The character is approaching death.</li><li><strong>Poison</strong> - The character is poisoned and their health will slowly deplete.</li></ul><p style="">Besides the EKG, players may also note the character's stance. Whence the characters starts holding onto their hip, that is a sign that their health is at least in the Caution state, or may even be poisoned.</p><p style="">Carrying the tradition set by the original Resident Evil, characters use a small variety of <a href="/medical-herb/3055-566/" data-ref-id="3055-566">herb</a>s to heal themselves and cure poisons. <a href="/first-aid-spray/3055-619/" data-ref-id="3055-619">First Aid Spray</a>s are also available, though they only have the singular purpose of healing the character fully. There exist three herb types, all of which can be combined in some way for different degrees of healing:</p><ul><li><b>Green Herb</b> - On its own will restore 25% of health.</li><li><b>Blue Herb</b> - On its own will cure poison, though will not restore any health.</li><li><b>Red Herb</b> - On its own does nothing.</li><li><b>Green + Green Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character by roughly 50% of health.</li><li><b>Green + Green + Green Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character completely, though not of any poisons.</li><li><b>Green + Blue Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character 25% of health and cure any poison.</li><li><b>Green + Green + Blue Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character 50% of health and cure any poison.</li><li><b>Green + Red Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character completely, though not of any poisons.</li><li><b>Green + Red + Blue Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character completely including poisons.</li><li><b>Red + Blue Herb</b> - Mixed will do nothing.</li></ul><h3>Saving</h3><p style="">Like every other main Resident Evil game pre-Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil requires that players find one of the many typewriters located throughout the environments to save, and must also have at least one ink ribbon item in their character's inventory.</p><h2>Story</h2><h3>Main Characters</h3><h4><a href="/chris-redfield/3005-413/" data-ref-id="3005-413">Chris Redfield</a></h4><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8497/236303-character_chris.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-236303" data-size="small" data-ratio="2" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:200.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8497/236303-character_chris.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-236303"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8497/236303-character_chris.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8497/236303-character_chris.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">One of the two main playable characters, Chris is the S.T.A.R.S.

The primary difference between the two is which characters are featured and what their role is. For Chris Redfield's story, he works alongside Rebecca Chambers amidst their attempts to survive the Mansion, whereas Jill Valentine has Barry Burton as her supporting character. However, both Rebecca and Barry do not appear in the other character's campaigns; Barry will at least still show up in the opening cutscene during Chris's story, but then disappears completely and isn't encountered again. And Rebecca Chambers is omitted from Jill Valentine's story completely.</p><p style="">Whichever of the two main characters the player selects, the other is then also absent from the majority of the game until the very end. The canon telling of the game's story is made up of varying factors of both interpretations, however, including the involvement of both Rebecca Chambers and Barry Burton.</p><h3>Plot</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661819-dolphin-2012-09-27-00-31-23-08.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661819" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661819-dolphin-2012-09-27-00-31-23-08.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661819"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661819-dolphin-2012-09-27-00-31-23-08.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661819-dolphin-2012-09-27-00-31-23-08.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Barry, Wesker, and Jill</figcaption></figure><p style="">When the police received report of grisly murder cases happening in <a href="/arklay-mountains/3035-387/" data-ref-id="3035-387">Arklay Mountains</a>, a group called Bravo Team of <a href="/special-tactics-and-rescue-service/3015-1450/" data-ref-id="3015-1450">S.T.A.R.S.</a> is sent to investigate the report in 23th July, 1998; the group is formed by <a href="/enrico-marini/3005-3885/" data-ref-id="3005-3885">Enrico Marini</a>, <a href="/rebecca-chambers/3005-1306/" data-ref-id="3005-1306">Rebecca Chambers</a>, <a href="/kenneth-j-sullivan/3005-3136/" data-ref-id="3005-3136">Kenneth J.

Team medic Rebecca Chambers is the only one who is found to be in good health. As S.T.A.R.S. travel throughout more of the mansion, and the nearby residence building, they soon learn that this mansion is owned by one Ozwell E.

Though he has now decided to move on from Umbrella to continue his own nefarious ambitions, and only brought in his own S.T.A.R.S. team so as to collect combat data; he was also blackmailing Barry Burton by way of his family so as to lead the other S.T.A.R.S. members astray, though Barry will eventually break free of Wesker's hold and save his compatriots. Wesker himself is seemingly killed by his own creation the T-002 Tyrant--a hulking monster with a large, imposing claw--after he releases it to kill the remaining S.T.A.R.S. members. The team are then able to successfully kill the creature, place a bomb in the laboratory, and escape the resulting explosion via helicopter piloted by Brad Vickers, who had abandoned the team during the beginning in the forest once the undead dogs shown up.</p><h3>Alternate Endings</h3><p style="">Not only depending on which main character the player chooses, the endings of the game can also be determined by specific choices made throughout the game based on which characters manage to survive.</p><p style="">During Chris's story once the player returns to the Mansion after exploring the Residential building, Rebecca is forced into an encounter with a Hunter and screams for help; if the player can't reach her quick enough, she will die. If she survives, then Rebecca will able to set the bomb to destroy the mansion, triggering the resurgence of Tyrant on the Helipad. It'll slowly advance towards Rebecca and if the player isn't able to pull his attention away from her, it'll kill her instantly. Jill Valentine can also be left behind (and potentially killed for certain if Rebecca is still alive by that point) if the player isn't able to find the three MO discs required to unlock the door to her cell, and vice versa when playing as Jill herself.</p><p style="">During Jill's story amidst the Lisa Trevor boss battle, Barry Burton pulls his gun on Jill with what is insinuated to be the intent to kill her. During his hesitation, Jill swiftly pulls the gun from him and directs it back at him. However as Lisa Trevor closes in, Barry pleads that Jill hands him his gun. From here the player has the choice of giving it to him or not; if not, Barry will be killed. If so, then he will fight alongside Jill against Lisa. Though Barry may still be killed during this fight if Lisa gets close enough to knock him off into the chasm below.</p><p style="">If Barry survives the encounter, which sets in the motion the outcome of Wesker escaping and setting the Mansion to self-destruct, this triggers the ambush by Tyrant on the Helipad. It'll then slowly advance towards Barry and if the player isn't able to pull his attention from him, it'll kill Barry instantly.</p><p style="">Overall there are technically eight endings in total dependant on which combination of characters managed to survive the Mansion Incident, which also affects other such outcomes including whether or not the Mansion is destroyed.</p><p style=""><b>Chris' Story</b>:</p><ol><li>Chris, Rebecca, and Jill survive; Albert Wesker is killed; the Spencer Mansion is destroyed.</li><li>Chris and Jill survive; Albert Wesker is killed; the Spencer Mansion is left as it is along with Tyrant.</li><li>Chris and Rebecca survive; Albert Wesker is killed; the Spencer Mansion is destroyed.</li><li>Chris survives; Albert Wesker is killed; the Spencer Mansion is left as it is along with Tyrant.</li></ol><p style=""><b>Jill's story:</b></p><ol><li>Jill, Barry, and Chris survive; Albert Wesker escapes; the Spencer Mansion is destroyed.</li><li>Jill and Chris survive; Albert Wesker is killed; the Spencer Mansion is left as it is along with Tyrant.</li><li>Jill and Barry survive; Albert Wesker escapes; the Spencer Mansion is destroyed.</li><li>Jill survives; Albert Wesker is killed; the Spencer Mansion is left as it is along with Tyrant.</li></ol><p style="">The canon ending of Resident Evil is again made up of varying factors across both stories, including the survival of Chris, Jill, Barry, and Rebecca, the destruction of the Mansion, Wesker's supposed 'death, and the hatred Wesker grows for Chris.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><h3>Survival Knife</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661782-survivalknifechriss.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661782" data-ratio="0.8" data-width="100" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 100px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661782-survivalknifechriss.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661782"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661782-survivalknifechriss.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661782-survivalknifechriss.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Considered to be a last resort tactic, the knife does very little damage and has dangerously small reach. Because of its low effectiveness, it is usually best for the player to just run or attempt to avoid the enemy rather than combat it. Both Chris and Jill have their own different style of knife, though the differences are purely cosmetic.</p><h3>Beretta 92F</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661783-handgun.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661783" data-ratio="0.8" data-width="100" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 100px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661783-handgun.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661783"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661783-handgun.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661783-handgun.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Jill Valentine's starting handgun, which Chris Redfield also eventually procures as his pistol as he lost it in the forest. The beretta is the weapon of choice to handle lesser enemies such as zombies and Cerberus dogs. When playing as Chris Redfield, the player has the chance to kill an enemy just with one shot, courtesy of Chris's skills in marksmanship.</p><h3>Colt Python</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661785-magnumrevolver.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661785" data-ratio="0.8" data-width="100" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 100px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661785-magnumrevolver.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661785"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661785-magnumrevolver.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661785-magnumrevolver.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Returning from the original is the Python Magnum Revolver. Simply massive in size, the Python is the third most powerful weapon in the game behind the Rocket Launcher and the Defense Gun. It can kill all lesser enemies just with one shot and is a reliable contender against boss battles. Though as one may expect, ammunition is terribly scarce.</p><h3>Colt Anaconda</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661786-barrys44magnum.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661786" data-ratio="0.8" data-width="100" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 100px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661786-barrys44magnum.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661786"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661786-barrys44magnum.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661786-barrys44magnum.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Barry Burton's own custom magnum revolver, the Anaconda is pretty much the exact same weapon in both power and appearance as the Python. It can also only be attained during Jill Valentine's story, and even then only if the player decides against giving Barry his gun back during the Lisa Trevor boss battle. However, the magnum ammo players find throughout the mansion isn't compatible with the Anaconda and as such becomes useless once all of its six rounds are used up.</p><h3>Self-Defense Gun</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661787-selfdefensegun.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661787" data-ratio="0.8" data-width="100" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 100px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661787-selfdefensegun.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661787"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661787-selfdefensegun.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661787-selfdefensegun.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">A small two-shot pistol, though with only one round left after the other was used by an Umbrella researcher to commit suicide, the Defense Gun is an unsuspectingly powerful weapon that packs about as much power as three shots from a Colt Python. However, because no further ammunition can be found, it is generally suited to being reserved for a boss battle more so than a regular enemy.</p><h3>Pump-Action Shotgun</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661788-shotgun.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661788" data-ratio="0.8" data-width="100" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 100px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661788-shotgun.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661788"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661788-shotgun.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661788-shotgun.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">About as reliable as ever, the remake's shotgun has a strong kick and plenty of power, making it a fine choice for just about any enemy across the game. It can kill a zombie outright with just a single shot when aimed at the head, and it can even keep Hunters at bay as well. When facing against certain boss battles, like Plant 42, the character will be shown to aim down the barrel whereas they usually aim from the hip.</p><p style="">Acquiring the shotgun can differ slightly between Chris and Jill. Because collecting the shotgun will instigate the ceiling trap, Chris therefore requires the Broken Shotgun item to trade in its place. However Jill may potentially be able to collect it without the need for the Broken Shotgun.</p><p style="">Should Jill collect the shotgun, Barry will then arrive to save her from the trap. Though only if the player didn't meet Barry prior when finding the corpse of Forest Speyer, otherwise Jill will then require the Broken Shotgun item as well.</p><h3>Assault Shotgun</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661789-assaultshotgun.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661789" data-ratio="0.8" data-width="100" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 100px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661789-assaultshotgun.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661789"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661789-assaultshotgun.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661789-assaultshotgun.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Richard Aiken's weapon of choice, the Assault Shotgun can only be attained if players manage to give him the serum to help remedy his poison infection in time. Richard doesn't give players his gun himself, however, and will instead be left as a 'parting gift' after he is killed either by Neptune (Chris's story) or Yawn (Jill's story). Once acquired, it then makes the original shotgun practically obsolete, as it can hold more ammunition and is slightly more powerful.</p><h3>Grenade Launcher</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661790-grenadelauncher.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661790" data-ratio="0.8" data-width="100" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 100px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661790-grenadelauncher.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661790"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661790-grenadelauncher.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661790-grenadelauncher.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Once again only available in Jill Valentine's story, the Grenade Launcher is a powerful and diverse weapon that has access to a small variety of grenade types. There are the regular explosive grenade rounds, which do a sizeable amount of damage against just about anything; flame rounds, which while powerful, are especially effective against such creatures as Plant 42; and acid, which has a decent degree of splash and continuous damage.</p><h3>Flamethrower</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661791-flamethrower.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661791" data-ratio="0.8" data-width="100" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 100px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661791-flamethrower.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661791"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661791-flamethrower.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661791-flamethrower.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Only find in Chris's campaign, the flamethrowers acts as both a weapon and a puzzle item, as the player requires it so as to trigger the unlocking of certain doors in the underground caverns. When used as a weapon, it's decent at staving off Hunters as the continuous spray will cause the Hunter to rapidly flinch. Fuel quickly depletes, however, and no more can be found. A second flamethrower is also conveniently left outside the area where the player faces against the giant spider queen, Black Tiger. Once the player moves on from the underground sections, they cannot take the flamethrower with them as it is required to unlock the way out.</p><h3>Rocket Launcher</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661792-rocketlauncher.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661792" data-ratio="0.8" data-width="100" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 100px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661792-rocketlauncher.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661792"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661792-rocketlauncher.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661792-rocketlauncher.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">An old four-shot rocket launcher that is only available during the final encounter against the T-002 Tyrant.

Slow and sluggish in movement, but dangerous up close, zombies are durable enough against gunfire that they can prove to be extremely dangerous even just in small numbers. When encountered on their own, however, zombies can be dispatched relatively easy so long as the player has enough ammunition to spare. As per usual, zombies are best dealt with the pistol or sometimes the shotgun, which can kill a zombie with a single shot if the player aims directly at its head once close enough, or can at least reduce the zombie to a literal crawl by destroying its legs.</p><p style="">Zombies attack by grabbing and biting the player when close, but will also puke out acid instead if they can't quite reach the player. Some zombies will be encountered lying on the ground, seemingly pretending to be dead, and will grab at a character's leg should the player get close enough. However, the leg bite does little damage and will always result in the character killing the zombie with a single stomp or kick.</p><p style="">When encountered on stairs zombies are much less of a threat, as they won't attempt to bite the player and will simply rely on their acid vomit making them significantly easier to rush past.</p><h3>Crimson Heads</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2354682-crimson.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2354682" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.8" data-width="250" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 250px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2354682-crimson.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2354682"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2354682-crimson.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2354682-crimson.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">One such infamous feature of Resident Evil are Crimson Heads. A significantly stronger, faster, and more aggressive variation of the regular zombies, the Crimson Head transformation will occur after a short while once a regular zombie has been ''killed''. The only way to halt the transformation is for players to burn the corpse afterwards (or kill a zombie by destroying the head) using a lighter and some gas fluid, both of which must be in the player's inventory for use. Otherwise after an allotted time, once returning to an area the now Crimson Head zombie will quickly spring into action and will forever persist in that area until it has been killed.</p><p style="">While Crimson Heads will place priority in hunting the player character down, they are known to also slash their way past any other regular zombies that gets in their way amidst their search.</p><h3>Cerberus Dogs</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357195-cerberus_re.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2357195" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.93896713615023" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:93.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357195-cerberus_re.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2357195"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2357195-cerberus_re.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2357195-cerberus_re.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Alongside regular zombies, some sort of iteration surrounding infected dogs have persisted across nearly every Resident Evil game to date. Starting at the beginning, so to speak, the Cerberus Dogs of Resident Evil are infected Doberman breeds, purposely engineered to be a form of B.O.W. Cerberus dogs retain the same agility and tenacity as a regular dog, though with a massive increase in aggressiveness, brutality, and stamina.</p><p style="">Like zombies, Cerberus dogs are best left for lesser weaponry like the pistols and shotguns. Running past is always an option as well, as both Chris and Jill are just ever so slightly faster than the canines. However their attacks can sometimes cover just enough distance to close the gap and catch the player character.</p><h3>Web Spinners</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357199-giant_spider.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2357199" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.60860215053763" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:60.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357199-giant_spider.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2357199"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2357199-giant_spider.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2357199-giant_spider.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Giant, hairy spiders, the Web Spinners are a tenacious foe across Resident Evil, though they primarily appear only briefly within the Residential building. They can crawl along walls like any other spider, and will often try to charge forward and bite players when given the opportunity. However, their greatest weapon is their poison spit, which they will routinely spray; it has a fairly long reach of attack and has a high chance of poisoning the player, though the base damage it inflicts isn't quite as alarming. Before they fire their spit, they can first be heard to be readying it within their body.</p><p style="">Web Spinners have surprisingly tough hides and are most susceptible to the Grenade Launcher - specifically when equipped with flame rounds. They will also often strafe once they've been shot and attempt to counter the player as such. If a Web Spinner is killed with its sack intact, a large multitude of baby spiders will seep out of the corpse and attack the player. Though their damage is even less than that of a crow and should the player leave the area, they will return to find them all gone.</p><h3>Hunters</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357193-hunter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2357193" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.4464285714286" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:144.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357193-hunter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2357193"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2357193-hunter.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2357193-hunter.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">First appearing once players return to the Mansion after investigating the Residential building, Hunters will then replace the common zombies of the game and will be encountered throughout in most areas where the zombies originally populated. Hunters are extremely dangerous and one of the most antagonising enemies throughout the franchise, let alone Resident Evil. They attack using their sharp claws and their most common source of attack is to leap through the air and slash the player. Though the player can still manage to shoot the Hunter mid-jump if they react fast enough.</p><p style="">Should the character's health be in the Caution state or lower, however, the Hunter's dive will be replaced with a swift cleave which will decapitate the character killing them instantly. Though they will at least let out a distinctive shriek first to notify players they are preparing such an attack. Hunters take one, sometimes two, shots from the Colt Python, which makes for the most suitable weapon. Otherwise the grenade launcher, and even the shotgun, can do the job if there's enough distance between the Hunter and the player. However Hunters are almost always encountered in groups of at least two.</p><h3>Chimera</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357196-chimera_remake.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2357196" data-size="small" data-ratio="1" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357196-chimera_remake.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2357196"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2357196-chimera_remake.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2357196-chimera_remake.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Encountered only within the secret underground laboratory, Chimeras are wretched creatures made up of both human and fly DNA. Like Hunters, these too were artificially created by Umbrella themselves, though they apparently proved to be unreliable and not as effective as the Hunter B.O.W. They primarily function like a cross between Web Spinners and Hunters; Chimera's can scuttle across flat surfaces, and will usually try to slash the player from above, but will also land into the floor and give chase. From this stage, Chimera's may possibly leap onto the character's back and slice them from there.</p><p style="">They can be relatively easy to avoid, however--especially if they've following whilst on the ceiling--and typically take around 2-3 shotgun rounds should direct combat come to pass. Though much like the Hunters, Chimera are rarely encountered alone and they will sometimes attempt to swarm the player as a pairing by attacking from two different directions.</p><h3>Adders</h3><p style="">Highly aggressive poisonous snakes, Adders can be found throughout the Mansion garden and will drop from the trees landing in front of the player. The damage they do is minimal, though there's a high chance they can poison the player and there's often a large number of them at that. Running past them is the best option, however due to their size they can be difficult to distinguish. If the player decides on combat they will at least die by but a single handgun shot.</p><h3>Wasps</h3><p style="">Found in the Residential building, a sizeable wasp cocoon has formed within. Though the wasps themselves do very little damage and die with at most 2 shots from a handgun, they will continually respawn until the player can find the item required to put an end to the wasp cocoon.</p><h2>Boss Battles</h2><h3>Crimson Head Prototype</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357197-crimson_head_elder.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2357197" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.0239361702128" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:102.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357197-crimson_head_elder.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2357197"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2357197-crimson_head_elder.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2357197-crimson_head_elder.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">The first zombie that underwent the Crimson Head transformation, Umbrella scientists managed to restrain it and locked it underground in a tomb. Once released by the player, it soon awakens and begins chase just as the gate is closed behind to stop the player from escaping. The Prototype functions much like an ordinary Crimson Head zombie; it'll run at the player and attempt to swipe with their claws, however it will always use its right claw, allowing the player to avoid its attack if they run to the left. It will continue this routine until it dies, which only requires around 4-5 shotgun shells on the Normal difficulty.</p><h3>Yawn Part I</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357191-pachislot_yawn.png" data-ref-id="1300-2357191" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.79110251450677" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:79.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357191-pachislot_yawn.png" data-ref-id="1300-2357191"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2357191-pachislot_yawn.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2357191-pachislot_yawn.png"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">A monstrously huge snake that resides within an attic, Yawn will surface once the player enters in search of a crest. This battle is completely voluntary, however, as the player can attempt to just collect the crest and escape. Because of the snake's size, this can sometimes prove difficult. If the player is bitten there's a high that they'll be poisoned. If the player's poisoned, the character will pass out once they escape the room.</p><p style="">As Jill, she will pass out and fall to the ground, with Barry arriving soon after who will take her to the first floor save room. This is all done instantaneously amidst a black screen, however, and Jill will wake up to find Barry gone. As Chris, he too will pass out just as he leaves the area and will be greeted by Rebecca Chambers. However in this occurrence, the player takes control of Rebecca and must collect the serum from the first floor medicinal save room for Chris within 7 minutes, otherwise he will die and the game will be over. Fighting Yawn can be tricky because of its size and its stamina; it will generally require around 10 shotgun shots or 4-5 grenade launcher rounds on the Normal difficulty to force it to flee.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400172-yawnuc.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2400172" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.77011494252874" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:77.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400172-yawnuc.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2400172"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400172-yawnuc.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400172-yawnuc.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Also to note is during Jill's playthrough, and if the player manages to save Richard Aiken from his poison infection, once the player goes to fight Yawn Richard will join soon after equipped with his custom Assault Shotgun. From there he will assist the player if they choose to attack Yawn; after so much damage, Yawn will recede away, but will strike again once Jill and Richard lower their guard and will swallow Richard whole. If the player instead chooses to ignore Yawn and collect the crest and leave, Richard will scream after no doubt suffering the same fate. If players fight alongside Richard until his inevitable death, they will then be able to collect his assault shotgun - the cutscene of Richard pushing Jill out of the way depicts him dropping his shotgun at the last second. However should players abandon Richard, then the shotgun is presumably gobbled up by Yawn alongside Richard and cannot be collected</p><h3>Yawn Part II</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400175-resident_evil_remake_giant_snake_boss_yawn.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2400175" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400175-resident_evil_remake_giant_snake_boss_yawn.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2400175"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400175-resident_evil_remake_giant_snake_boss_yawn.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400175-resident_evil_remake_giant_snake_boss_yawn.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Located in the library, Yawn will resurface after the player while they're looking for a specific book. Yawn functions exactly like it did in the previous battle and will slither throughout the environment in its attempts to bite and poison the player. Unlike the first encounter, this battle is mandatory as finally killing Yawn is the only way to trigger it knocking the bookcase and revealing a book the player needs.</p><p style="">If the player is poisoned this time they are left to carry on without any assist. Though by this point blue herbs to cure the poison are now accessible and can be found throughout the mansion. Any of the damage inflicted on Yawn previously will have had no effect and Yawn now requires a significant amount more punishment to beat.</p><h3>Lisa Trevor Part I</h3><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5322/528029-lisa_about_to_hit.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-528029" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5322/528029-lisa_about_to_hit.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-528029"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5322/528029-lisa_about_to_hit.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5322/528029-lisa_about_to_hit.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Lisa Trevor is a new character and boss specifically created for the remake. She is a young teen girl, but one that underwent extensive testing and experimentation with a number of viruses turning her into a hunchbacked monster. Lisa was actually the precursor for the Nemesis project seen in <a href="/resident-evil-3-nemesis/3030-5587/" data-ref-id="3030-5587">Resident Evil 3,</a> though unlike Nemesis, Lisa cannot be controlled.</p><p style="">The first time Lisa is encountered is when the player enters the nearby cabin in the woods and is ambushed by Lisa knocking the player character out. Once the character comes to, they quickly take notice of Lisa Trevor as she slowly limps toward the player. Lisa is invincible and can only be temporarily warded for a couple of seconds; this can help the player escape the cabin, which at this point in time is the only option the player has. Lisa's attacks can do a great deal of damage at that and can kill both Chris or Jill in just 3 hits on the Normal difficulty.</p><h3>Lisa Trevor Part II</h3><p style="">Encountered within the Caves/Mines underneath the Mansion, Lisa Trevor functions as she did before and cannot be killed. Once again the player is to avoid all encounters with Lisa, though this time the player must also attempt to pull a couple of levers necessary to continue on. Like before, the player can attack Lisa enough that she may very briefly become incapacitated to allow the player past. The area is filled with a series of narrow pathways, however, which can make trying to run past Lisa head on practically impossible. Though there are multiple passageways that offer opportunities for the player to skirt Lisa and work their way around her.</p><h3>Lisa Trevor Part III</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400177-trevor_front.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2400177" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.4035087719298" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:140.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400177-trevor_front.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2400177"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400177-trevor_front.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400177-trevor_front.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">The final encounter with Lisa, Chris/Jill will arrive in a cavern and will be greeted by Albert Wesker as Chris and Barry Burton as Jill. As Chris, Wesker greets Chris and asks him to ''get a piece of the action''. During this battle, Wesker will attempt to help Chris in warding Lisa off.</p><p style="">There are two ways to beat this battle. Because the area is made of a small square platform surrounded on its left and right side by what looks like a endless pit, the player can potentially do enough damage to force Lisa off the edge, though this requires a fair amount of damage inflicted unto Lisa. Otherwise the player can attempt to manoeuvre around the area pushing the stones off of the surface; once all four have been pushed off, this will open the coffin in the middle that contains the remains of Lisa's mother. The sight of her mother will drive Lisa to temporarily express the one small piece of humanity she has left as she cries in vain at her mother and leaps off into the abyss with a shriek.</p><p style="">With Jill this battle plays out the same, though the opening will offer the player a choice to hand Barry his custom magnum after handily taking it off him after he threateningly directed it at Jill. If the player chooses Yes, then Barry will fight alongside Jill; if No, then Lisa will knock Barry off killing him, forcing Jill to fight alone but also letting her keep Barry's fully loaded magnum revolver.</p><p style="">When fighting against Lisa she uses the same array of attacks. Though the tactic for knocking her off works both ways as she too can not only knock the player off, but also their AI ally. If Barry is knocked off he is then declared dead for the ending. However, if Wesker is knocked off he will still appear during the end as per usual.

Once entering the aqua tank, the player will be enveloped in knee high water which will slow their character's movement speed. The player is to quickly run across the walkway into the control room before Neptune leaps out and attacks; the music will quickly rise in tempo and urgency to let the player know how close Neptune is to attacking. It's possible to avoid Neptune, but if it is in reach of the player it will quickly pull the player into the water killing them instantly.</p><p style="">Once the player has reached the control room, and has climbed down the ladder, they'll now be underwater, faced by Neptune on the opposite side of the window. Neptune will then attempt to break the glass, forcing the player to configure the settings in the control room to close the shutters over the window before Neptune smashes through the glass. Once that's done, and the water has been drained, the player will leave the room leading into the ground floor of the tank. Along the way the player will encounter two lesser infected sharks which are barely clinging to life within the oxygen. The player may choose to mercy kill them, though it's not necessary.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400184-full.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2400184" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400184-full.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2400184"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400184-full.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400184-full.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Eventually the player will reach Neptune, who is surfaced within a small pool of shallow water. It is completely docile for the time being, but once the player tries to grab a key they require on a platform past Neptune, it will spring into action and attempt to attack the player. Neptune cannot move, but the player is trapped on the small raised platform. Pushing the circuit box into the water and turning on the power will then kill Neptune completely, allowing the player to move past safely.</p><p style="">As Jill the scenario plays out as such, though when playing as Chris, and if Richard was cured of the snake poison inflicted by Yawn, Chris will encounter Richard as he first enters the tank. Richard will then quickly push Chris out of the way -- saving him from Neptune's attack, but dying in his place. Once the player has drained the tank, they can collect Richard's custom shotgun on the tank's ground floor.</p><h3>Plant 42</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400178-pachislot_plant_42.png" data-ref-id="1300-2400178" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.97229916897507" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:97.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400178-pachislot_plant_42.png" data-ref-id="1300-2400178"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400178-pachislot_plant_42.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400178-pachislot_plant_42.png"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">A huge and incredibly hostile plant that has been infused with the T-Virus. Dubbed Plant 42 for being located within ''Point 42'', the carnivorous plant has entrenched itself within the Residential Building and uses its vines to attack its prey throughout the building via small holes in the floors, walls and ceiling. If the player nears any of these holes, the plant's vine will attack and attempt to strangle the player until they waggle it off by mashing on the buttons. Once the body of the Plant has been located, this initiates the boss battle. Large in size, reaching the ceiling at around 12ft in height, it primarily attacks by using its vines to squirt small droplets of acid, though it will also attempt to attack the player by swiping them with its vines as well.</p><p style="">The best strategy is for the player to climb up the stairs reaching what remains of the second floor and shoot at the bulb. After enough damage, it will recede only to quickly sprout back out. As Jill, once this occurs Barry will arrive conveniently equipped with a flamethrower and will lay waste to the creature killing it.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400179-plant421_gamecube_res.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2400179" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400179-plant421_gamecube_res.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2400179"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400179-plant421_gamecube_res.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400179-plant421_gamecube_res.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">As Chris, the player may need to continue fighting from this stage until it's killed. However, if the player managed to save Richard, then as soon as Chris enters the room he will quickly be grabbed by the creature, just as Rebecca arrives on the scene. Chris will then hand her a file to help in creating the ''V-Jolt," a type of poison that will kill the plant. Now controlling Rebecca, the player is to head to the nearby chemistry room and make the concoction. With the V-Jolt made, the player must then find the roots within the building and administer the V-Jolt, which will weaken Plant 42 as before, releasing Chris. Though this won't have killed it completely and requires the player to unload a few more shotgun shells to put an end to Plant 42.</p><h3>Black Tiger</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400174-black2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2400174" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.69949494949495" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:69.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400174-black2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2400174"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400174-black2.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400174-black2.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">A gigantic tarantula, even by the giant spider standards of the game, the appropriately coined Black Tiger is colored in shades of black and grey. It functions like its smaller kin of spiders, though its poison spit is more ferocious and will actually shoot three splashes at once with a greater range. The environment is relatively small, which allows the player to run around the creature to keep out of its poison distance. The shotgun, grenade launcher and magnum work as expected, though Black Tiger is especially weak to flame rounds shot from the grenade launcher. As Chris, the player will have a flamethrower available which is also effective. Alongside Black Tiger are two regular Web Spinners as well that have the same attributes as previously encountered Web Spinners</p><p style="">Once killed, a multitude of small spiders will begin to seep out of its corpse, though leaving the area and returning will remove them from the area.</p><h3>Tyrant T-002 Part I</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357192-re_tyrant.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2357192" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.5748299319728" data-width="294" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 294px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:157.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357192-re_tyrant.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2357192"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2357192-re_tyrant.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2357192-re_tyrant.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">After Wesker's betrayal is revealed, he (or Barry accidentally) will release Tyrant, where it will proceed to slowly walk towards the player. The battle itself is relatively simple as it will only walk towards the player, though it won't flinch against any gunfire. Keeping Tyrant at a safe distance, while circling the large lab equipment, the player should be able to down the monster without taking any damage so long as they have enough ammo. Tyrant is unsurprisingly thick skinned and requires a fair amount of ammunition; the magnum alone will still take around 8 rounds to put down on the Normal difficulty.</p><h3>Tyrant T-002 Part II</h3><p style="">The final battle of the game, this second encounter with Tyrant is only triggered should the player have Barry or Rebecca alive, otherwise this battle will be skipped altogether and Brad Vickers will arrive to pick up the remaining characters.</p><p style="">Otherwise it will erupt from the ground on the heliport and its gameplay design will have now changed drastically. No longer content in steadily walking towards the player, Tyrant will now routinely break into a quick sprint and swipe with its massive claw at the player dealing a great deal of damage. With Barry or Rebecca at their side, the player at least has some backup. Though they too can be killed by Tyrant and must also reload when necessary. After Tyrant has received enough damage, or the timer that is ticking down has reached around 30 seconds, Brad Vickers will drop down a rocket launcher the player must use to kill Tyrant.</p><p style="">Equipped with only four shots, the Tyrant will manage to deflect the first, though the second will score a direct hit destroying the Tyrant completely.</p><h2>Unlockables</h2><p style="">Resident Evil contains just about all of the original version's suite of unlockables and some of its own original inclusions.</p><h3>Costumes</h3><p style="">Getting the Happy ending (with all three characters surviving the Mansion Incident) will gift a key that the player begins with in their inventory once they load their completed save. The key can then be used to unlock a secret room--the large painting in the first room to the right from the hall--which has two costumes per character.</p><p style="">Should players change their costume as Chris, Rebecca Chambers will be shown wearing a <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/images/1300-2636857/" data-ref-id="1300-2636857">cowgirl outfit</a> instead of her STARS uniform.

Because of its higher fire rate, the Samurai Edge can prove useful not only against regular zombies, but even larger enemies like Hunters and certain bosses given its infinite quantity of ammunition. The Samurai Edge is unlocked by completing the game once under five hours on the Normal or Hard difficulty setting, and can be found in the character's inventory when loading a cleared game save.</p><h3><b>Rocket Launcher</b></h3><p style="">Unlocked by completing the game on Normal or Hard under 3 hours.

The game will play out as usual, however the zombified Forest Speyer will sporadically appear in certain areas and will give chase. Forest will function like an ordinary zombie and will try to grab and bite the player, though he runs at the speed of a Crimson Head. The player cannot attack Forest in any way, either, as he has a bandoleer of grenades strapped around his torso and any attacks will cause him to explode -- killing the player instantly regardless of the distance.</p><p style="">Because Forest is travelling around the mansion and has already reanimated, he will of course not be found in the outside balcony as per usual. Forest will also only be encountered within the Spencer Mansion and will not follow into the other environments across the game. There is no way to turn off this mode and the player must start a new save to play without the stalking of Speyer.</p><h3>Invisible Enemy Mode</h3><p style="">Unlocked by completing on any difficulty in any time, the Invisible Enemy Mode is as self-explanatory as they get -- all of the enemies within the game, bosses included, are invisible to the player. There is no longer any auto aim at that, though they will make their typical sound effects once the player is in the location. The player's unlockable weapons/costumes will not carry over into this mode.</p><h3>Real Survivor Mode</h3><p style="">Unlocked by completing on any difficulty in any time, Real Survivor mode was initially a prototype mode for the original Resident Evil. Its notary difference is that the item boxes no longer share items and any items stored in one particular box will forever stay exclusively in that one box. Auto aim is also disabled and the gameplay modifiers are set within the Hard mode settings.</p><h2>HD Remastered Port</h2><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2692550-residentevilremakevideo610.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2692550" data-ratio="0.56229508196721" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2692550-residentevilremakevideo610.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2692550"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2692550-residentevilremakevideo610.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2692550-residentevilremakevideo610.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Announced on August 5th, 2014 was an HD port version of the Resident Evil remake for PS3, PS4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and PC. Its pre-rendered backgrounds are to be upscaled (720p on PS3 and Xbox 360; 1080p on PS4 and Xbox One), though certain objects and even whole areas were redone completely in polygons.</p><p style="">Character models are redone in HD, and it also allows players to select between 4:3 or 16:9 aspect ratio. However when playing in 16:9 the screen will crop the image and then pan up/down depending on the direction the character moves.</p><p style="">While the game still offers the classic tank control scheme, more modernized analogue controls are also be available as an alternative -- to which the player can switch between in real-time. A Very Easy mode was included as well to further increase its accessibility for a more modern audience. The Remastered port was released in both physical and digital formats, however its physical format is restricted to its PS3 and 360 versions, and only in Japan.</p><p style="">Online Leaderboards are available in this version, as is a new Gallery mode that lets players re-watch the game's pre-rendered cutscenes.</p><p style="">The port was rather successful and proved to be Capcom's top selling digital release of all time, selling over a million copies. This success resulted in the team moving on to have <a href="/resident-evil-zero/3030-10247/" data-ref-id="3030-10247">Resident Evil Zero</a> undergo a similar such remastering.</p><h3>Contagion Campaign</h3><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2687501-2684701-10711079_845057115515177_4484635678431131443_n%2B%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2687501" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2687501-2684701-10711079_845057115515177_4484635678431131443_n%2B%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2687501"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2687501-2684701-10711079_845057115515177_4484635678431131443_n%2B%281%29.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2687501-2684701-10711079_845057115515177_4484635678431131443_n%2B%281%29.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">A form of viral marketing for the HD Remaster port, the Contagion Campaign allowed Resident Evil fans to ''spread the infection'' by signing up via email, facebook, or <a href="/resident-evilnet/3015-7553/" data-ref-id="3015-7553">ResidentEvil.net</a>. Upon doing so would add to the overall infection percentage shown on the site; sharing the user's status on such social media sites as facebook or twitter would also help further the infection.</p><p style="">Capcom later announced that should the infection reach 100%, they would include Chris and Jill's BSAA outfits from <a href="/resident-evil-5/3030-20569/" data-ref-id="3030-20569">Resident Evil 5</a> in the game, though Chris's his Lost in Nightmares outfit as opposed to his default RE5 attire.</p><p style="">On September 26th, the ''infection'' officially reached 100%, assuring that the new costumes were to appear in the HD Remastered port. The costumes are unlocked at the outset and can be selected within the character select menu, which is also now how the other unlockable costumes of the game are to be selected as well.</p><h2>Development</h2><p style="">To better connect this game with narrative advancements of later games, Resident Evil spliced in some additional story details that were absent from the original. One of the more noticeable ones is the addition of <a href="/george-trevor/3005-11814/" data-ref-id="3005-11814">George</a> and <a href="/lisa-trevor/3005-6121/" data-ref-id="3005-6121">Lisa Trevor</a>. George designed the Arklay Mansion which ultimately ended up being his grave and his daughter Lisa was the subject of Umbrella's hideous experiments and will be encountered by the player at various times through the game. These additions were scrapped from the original game but have been added in to give the Resident Evil mythos some more depth. Other such additions include the mention of <a href="/william-birkin/3005-3332/" data-ref-id="3005-3332">William Birkin</a> and <a href="/alexia-ashford/3005-4456/" data-ref-id="3005-4456">Alexia Ashford</a>.</p><p style="">There were also several new locations created for the remake such as the Graveyard behind the secret door in the main hall and Lisa's Cabin in the Courtyard. These extra locations gave the game new puzzles that the player would find a new challenge even if they played and completed the original. Even puzzles that were ported over from the original were remixed, as were enemy placements and the general design of the mansion was reworked in places so as to give the mansion the feeling of nostalgia, yet with plenty of surprises for veterans of the series.</p><h2>PC System Requirements</h2><h3>MINIMUM</h3><ul><li>OS: Windows 7 SP1 / Windows 8.1</li><li>Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo 2.4

Players will receive the Sword at the start of the game and the Ancient Sword during the first quest of the game; the remaining swords can be found through completing side quests, exploring the map, trading White Blocks to King Block, or by performing well in mini-games.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Most swords can be upgraded by visiting the blacksmith in the village of Raejack. Each sword is has a base rating as well as a maximum in the following seven attributes:</p><ul><li><b>Length</b>: how far the sword extends. Values can range from Lv 0 to Lv 20.</li><li><b>Width</b>: how wide the sword strikes. Values can range from Lv 0 to Lv 20.</li><li><b>Strength</b>: amount of damage the sword does per strike. Values can range from Lv 1 to Lv 20.</li><li><b>Spin</b>: whether or not the player can spin with the sword extended. Values can range from Lv 0 (no spin) to Lv 1 (can spin).</li><li><b>Beam</b>: swords with Beam attributes can shoot a projectile when swung with full health. Values can range from Lv 0 (does not fire) to Lv 3.</li><li><b>Pierce</b>: whether or not the sword will pass through obstacles. Values can range from Lv 0 (no pierce) to Lv 1 (does pierce).</li><li><b>Special</b>: some swords carry additional special abilities. Values can range from Lv 0 to Lv 5.</li></ul><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">In addition to the per-attribute maximum ratings, each sword has a <b>Potential</b> value. Potential is the maximum amount of money that players are allowed to spend upgrading it, preventing a player from maxing out all the statistics for any given sword. For example, should a player upgrade the Ancient Sword to the maximum strength, they will not have enough potential left over to add Pierce. (In the event of upgrade regret, swords can be reset back to their base statistics at the blacksmith if necessary.)</p><h2>Patch 1.01 Controversy</h2><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/1916380-sackboy_comes_to_3d_dot_game_heroes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1916380" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.56603773584906" data-width="318" style="width: 318px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/1916380-sackboy_comes_to_3d_dot_game_heroes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1916380"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/1916380-sackboy_comes_to_3d_dot_game_heroes.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/1916380-sackboy_comes_to_3d_dot_game_heroes.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>3D Dot Sackboy!</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">On September 23, 2010, Atlus U.S.A. released a patch for the North American version of the game, adding 50 player- and staff-created characters (most notably, a <a href="/sackboy/3005-663/" data-ref-id="3005-663">Sackboy</a> character from Media Molecule's LittleBigPlanet franchise), bug fixes while also slightly adapting finish times requirements for the Dash Circuit races and adding the ability to carry over certain swords into a New Game+ playthrough.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Because Atlus U.S.A. does not publish its retail games outside the US, the game's European publisher, Southpeak Interactive, would have had to issue the patch for EU gamers.

The player's bowling motion is initiated by 'getting set' by pulling the top trigger on the controller and then initiating the bowling motion by pulling and holding the bottom trigger on the controller. Much like in Bowling in Wii Sports, the trigger is let go when the player brings their hand forward and wants to release the ball down the lane. <br/> <br/>Brunswick promises to bring unprecedented depth to their bowling effort on the PS3 including the ability to read oil patterns on the lane and adjust for how that may affect your throw. <br/> <br/></p><h2>Kinect &amp; Move<br/></h2>Brunswick bowling will be a launch game for <a data-ref-id="3015-3249" href="/kinect-support/3015-3249/" slug="kinect-support"> Kinect</a>.

src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1450/1453560-29471c_kb_ss_0716__5_.jpg"></a></figure><p style="">The game is a <a href="/third-person-perspective/3015-464/" data-ref-id="3015-464">third-person</a> action/adventure title that relies heavily on cooperative <a href="/artificial-intelligence/3015-218/" data-ref-id="3015-218">AI</a> dynamics. It's similar to games like <a href="/ico/3030-9638/" data-ref-id="3030-9638">ICO</a> or <a href="/enslaved-odyssey-to-the-west/3030-28080/" data-ref-id="3030-28080">Enslaved: Odyssey to the West</a>, except with the roles reversed. The Majin is powerful and easily capable of protecting itself, whereas Tepeu is weak in comparison and can not dispatch enemies on his own (unless using the <a href="/stealth-kill/3015-2181/" data-ref-id="3015-2181">stealth attack</a>.) To progress, the player will have to control the Majin using basic commands and use the environment to their advantage to dispatch the shadow enemies. As the game continues, the player will get "friendship shards" which are used to level the Majin and gain access to new, more powerful attacks and commands. Strategy is important to the combat, as there are usually many enemies and they are fairly resilient.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p style="">A darkness is consuming the land. The story follows the efforts of <a href="/tepeu/3005-17294/" data-ref-id="3005-17294">Tepeu</a>, a young thief from a neighboring kingdom that is on the verge of collapse. To save his kingdom he enlists the help of the <a href="/majin/3005-17295/" data-ref-id="3005-17295">Majin</a>, a former guardian of the kingdom. The large, powerful magic creature has the ability to cleanse the land of darkness and save the kingdom from evil and corruption. After rescuing the Majin from imprisonment, Tepeu and the Majin set out on their quest. Over the course of the story, the Majin regains his lost power and his memories, lost from being imprisoned for so long.</p><h2>Development</h2><p style="">Producer Daisuke Uchiyama has said that a huge inspiration for the game came from European fairy tales, particularly the work of the Brothers Grimm.</p><p style="">Many people have compared the games tone to ICO and <a href="/shadow-of-the-colossus/3030-6522/" data-ref-id="3030-6522">Shadow of the Colossus</a>, particularly because of the AI dynamics and setting.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>27916</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/6/63119/1564555-91azzs_r4ql._aa1500_.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/63119/1564555-91azzs_r4ql._aa1500_.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/6/63119/1564555-91azzs_r4ql._aa1500_.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/63119/1564555-91azzs_r4ql._aa1500_.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/6/63119/1564555-91azzs_r4ql._aa1500_.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/63119/1564555-91azzs_r4ql._aa1500_.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/6/63119/1564555-91azzs_r4ql._aa1500_.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Majin and the Forsaken Kingdom]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>7</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating/><original_release_date>2010-11-23 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/majin-and-the-forsaken-kingdom/3030-27916/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[RB3]]></aliases><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-27919/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2009-08-22 08:40:41</date_added><date_last_updated>2014-01-05 17:17:00</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[Rock Band 3 spices up the brand with the addition of a keyboard peripheral as well as "Pro Mode," and offers eighty-three new songs to rock out to.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">In November of 2009, Dhani Harrison stated that was in the process of assisting <a data-ref-id="3010-648" href="/harmonix-music-systems-inc/3010-648/" slug="harmonix-music-systems-inc">Harmonix</a> on <i>Rock Band 3</i> and that they were working on making the instruments "more real" so that players will learn how to play an actual instrument while playing the game.</p><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56735/1398794-rb3screenwlogo13_1276211129.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1398794" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.56290322580645" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56735/1398794-rb3screenwlogo13_1276211129.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1398794"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/56735/1398794-rb3screenwlogo13_1276211129.jpg"></a><figcaption>The band's all here</figcaption></figure><p style=""><i>Rock Band 3</i> adds support for three vocal parts per song, first introduced in <a data-ref-id="3030-24667" href="/the-beatles-rock-band/3030-24667/" slug="the-beatles-rock-band"><i>The Beatles: Rock Band</i></a> and later included in <a data-ref-id="3030-29439" href="/green-day-rock-band/3030-29439/" slug="green-day-rock-band"><i>Green Day: Rock Band</i></a>. With the introduction of the keyboard player, up to seven players can now play simultaneously on one console, though only six players can join an online band.</p><p style=""><i>Rock Band 3</i> is fully compatible with all existing Rock Band instruments and the vast majority of in game content from previous games. All new <i>Rock Band</i> peripherals are being created by accessory maker Mad Catz, except for a special <i>Rock Band 3</i>-compatible guitar being specially developed by Fender. A keyboard and game bundle is available, but no other bundle is offered.</p><h2>Game Modes</h2><p style=""><i>Rock Band 3</i> has diverted from the previous games of the franchise in some ways, and in other ways has kept some of the more popular game modes.</p><h4>Quick Play</h4><p style="">Quick Play (Play Now) is mostly the same as it was in previous games--you can choose or create a setlist, or you can pick and choose individual songs. Additional players can jump in and out of Quick Play (and other game modes) at will. The library has undergone changes that provide the player(s) quicker and more efficient methods sorting and searching their library (see Music Library below).</p><h4>My Goals</h4><p style="">Under Career is a new "My Goals" section. The new My Goals section is a cross between achievements that have become commonplace in gaming, and the "Challenge" section in Rock Band 2. The player(s) can complete many of these goals over the course of gameplay, whether during Quickplay or Road Challenges, or simply using the My Goals section to knock out specific goals quickly. Goals may include tasks as simple as creating a band, or something more difficult such as scoring 90% or more on Expert Bass using up-strums only. There will be goals specific to each Rock Band game, and to Rock Band DLC, as well as goals specific to each instrument, and some general goals to chase as well. Although the player(s) can complete goals while playing in other modes, if the player(s) use the My Goals menu, the game will narrow the player's library down to the songs that will count towards the selected goal.</p><h4>Road Challenges</h4><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/111242/1624952-roadchallenges.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1624952" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.56312625250501" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/111242/1624952-roadchallenges.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1624952"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/111242/1624952-roadchallenges.jpg"></a><figcaption>Road Challenge Menu</figcaption></figure><p style="">The Road Challenge mode, which can be found under Play Now, is closer to Rock Band 1/2's Tour modes than any other mode in the game. As the picture to the right shows, the Road Challenges have various venues, which the player(s) can only get to if the necessary mode of transportation has been unlocked. As in previous games, the first venue is Hometown, although this time around the Hometown is generic.</p><p style="">Player(s) are not required to play through the disc songs to progress through this game mode. For each Challenge, the player(s) can choose a setlist. In the beginning, for example, the player has a choice between three setlists. The first setlist is usually disc songs. The other setlists will be either Random or Custom setlists based on particular genres or decades of music.</p><p style="">The objective of the Road Challenges is to complete particular challenges at each venue, earning spades along the way. These challenges may include keeping an accurate streak going, or deploying overdrive as often as possible. During the set, spades are accrued as the player(s) work towards completing the challenge. At the end of a set, stars earned are converted to spades, and all spades accrued during the set are added to a total spade count for that particular tour. At the end of a tour, the total spade count will result in bronze, silver, or gold quotas. The different levels of quotas open up different sets of gear for rockers.</p><p style="">A few examples of the challenges featured in the Road Challenge section are as follows:</p><ul><li><b>Overdrive Overdose</b> - Deploy your overdrive as often as possible.</li><li><b>Share the Spotlight</b> - Each band member will be in the spotlight at different times. When a band member is in the spotlight, they must perform their section accurately. Each band member that performs their section accurately adds to a chain bonus until the chain is broken.</li><li><b>Overdrive Chain</b> - Band members "chain" their overdrive deployment get the total band overdrive deployment time as long as possible.</li></ul><h2>New Features</h2><h4>Pro Mode</h4><p style="">One of <i>Rock Band 3</i>'s major new features is "Pro Mode," which is designed to bridge the gap between the game and playing actual instruments. Pro Mode has its own easy, medium, hard, and expert modes to ease players into more closely emulating what the actual musicians are playing. Each instrument, except for vocals, has its own variation on pro mode, as described below.</p><h4>Keyboards</h4><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56735/1398796-rb3screenwlogo15.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1398796" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.56290322580645" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56735/1398796-rb3screenwlogo15.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1398796"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/56735/1398796-rb3screenwlogo15.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/56735/1398796-rb3screenwlogo15.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Keyboards make their introduction with the release of <i>Rock Band 3</i>. The controller features 25 keys, and can be used as a regular keyboard. It can be used as a 'keytar' by using a guitar strap.</p><p style="">The keys are grouped into five colored sections. In basic mode, the note highway looks similar to guitar or bass. Players will only have to make sure to hit keys that match the color of the notes. In Pro Mode, players will have to press the correct individual key on the keyboard. The note highway will display three of the five colored sections and shift accordingly with the song.</p><p style="">The keyboard retails for $79.99 USD (UK: £69.99), or can be purchased in a bundle with a copy of the game for $129.99 USD (UK: £109.99) for the Xbox 360 and Wii. PS3 owners must purchase the game and keyboard separately.</p><h4>Guitar/Bass</h4><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56735/1398797-rb3screenwlogo15_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1398797" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.56290322580645" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56735/1398797-rb3screenwlogo15_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1398797"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/56735/1398797-rb3screenwlogo15_1.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/56735/1398797-rb3screenwlogo15_1.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Pro guitar chart on the left</figcaption></figure><p style="">Guitar and bass basic mode remains mostly unchanged from previous games. However, tremolo picking (fast strumming) and trills are a bit easier to do. Rather than having to match the rhythm of the guitarist's trills or fast strumming, players are able to keep their note streak alive by equaling or exceeding the artist's speed.</p><p style="">Pro guitar and bass offer the most significantly altered gameplay, as well as the greatest challenge yet. Pro Mode guitars and bass show and indicate which frets need to be held on each string. The guitarist then has to pluck the appropriate strings with the proper frets held down. As the difficulty ramps up, guitarists move from playing individual notes, to power chords, to imitating the actual guitar parts from each song. "You can go from plucking single notes to power chords and barre chords, we have crazy stuff like tapping and slides," senior Harmonix producer Sylvain Dubrofsky says. "If you ever had any aspirations of connecting with the music in a deeper way ... you are really going to like Rock Band 3." Pro-guitar and pro-bass songs also offer training options that break the songs down into sections and show the player how to play the different chords and notes.</p><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1099/1399492-100611rb3_screen_x360_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1399492" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.56275" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1099/1399492-100611rb3_screen_x360_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1399492"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1099/1399492-100611rb3_screen_x360_1.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1099/1399492-100611rb3_screen_x360_1.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Fender Mustang Pro by Mad Catz</figcaption></figure><p style="">Mad Catz and Fender released new advanced guitar controllers that take advantage of Pro mode. One of those models is a full-sized, fully functional six-string Squier Stratocaster from Fender. According to Harmonix PR man John Drake, "It can tell where your fingers are based on technology in the neck and the bridge of the guitar. No buttons. While you're playing it, it feels exactly like playing a real guitar, because that's what you're doing." The other guitar is the Fender Mustang Pro controller from accessory maker Mad Catz. It features a 17-fret design, which has a field of buttons on the neck, 102 in all.</p><p style="">The basic Rock Band guitar is basically unchanged from Rock Band 2's model and will retail for $59.99 USD. The Fender Mustang Pro Guitar retails for $149.99 USD. The Squier Stratocaster was released in March 1, 2011 for $280 USD and require a separate purchase of the Mad Catz MIDI adapter. The Stratocaster is not compatible with the standard 5-button guitar mode, but the Fender Mustang Pro guitar is.</p><h4>Drums</h4><p style="">Like guitar, basic drums are mostly unchanged in Rock Band 3. However, cymbal rolls were changed to work much like Guitar Hero's drums, in that players will have to meet or exceed the drummer's speed when rolling on the cymbals, as opposed to hitting the drummer's pace perfectly. The game supports a second kick pedal, which can be used as a double bass, though no songs will require it. It can also be used to make the yellow cymbal act as an open hi-hat note during drum fills and in freestyle mode.</p><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56735/1398789-rb3screen113_embargoed_until_june_11_1276211120.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1398789" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.56290322580645" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56735/1398789-rb3screen113_embargoed_until_june_11_1276211120.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1398789"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/56735/1398789-rb3screen113_embargoed_until_june_11_1276211120.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/56735/1398789-rb3screen113_embargoed_until_june_11_1276211120.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Pro Mode drums are different in that the note highway visually indicates which notes should be played on the cymbals and which should be played on the toms. Almost every song already released as DLC supports pro mode drums.</p><p style="">The <i>Rock Band 3</i> drum kit must be purchased with a full set of three Pro cymbals. It retails for $129.99 USD. The pro cymbals are improved from the <i>Rock Band 2</i> model in that they are softer, quieter, more accurate, and set at a 30 degree angle to emulate the cymbals on an actual drum set. The Pro cymbals can be purchased separately for $39.99 USD and are compatible with <i>Rock Band 2</i> and <i>The Beatles: Rock Band</i> drum kits. In the UK, the cymbals must be bought with the Rock Band 3 drum kit as part of a bundle, due to the <i>Rock Band 2</i> drums never being sold by British retailers.</p><h4>Vocals</h4><p style="">Vocal harmonies, first featured in <i>The Beatles: Rock Band</i>, return in <i>Rock Band 3</i>. Harmonies are only available for local multiplayer due to "latency issues." However, online bands can have three vocalists if they're all using the same console. Additionally, due to licensing issues, vocal harmonies are not included in DLC that has already been released. Vocals also include some amount of pitch correction to improve the way that singers sound. This feature is optional.</p><p style="">Microphones retail for $29.99. <i>Lips</i> microphones are compatible with <i>Rock Band 3</i>.</p><h4>Character Customization</h4><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56735/1398788-rb3screen112_embargoed_until_june_11_1276211116.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1398788" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.56290322580645" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56735/1398788-rb3screen112_embargoed_until_june_11_1276211116.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1398788"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/56735/1398788-rb3screen112_embargoed_until_june_11_1276211116.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/56735/1398788-rb3screen112_embargoed_until_june_11_1276211116.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Character customization is more robust in <i>Rock Band 3</i>. As opposed to choosing from a selection of pre-defined body parts and types, each character's features can be individually adjusted via analog sliders to provide a more unique-looking character. However, attitudes (e.g. goth, rock, punk) will not be selectable, as character animations will be more closely tied to the song. Clothing and accessories are unlocked as players progress through goals and road challenges. Players do not earn money to "purchase" clothing for their avatars.</p><h4>Music Library</h4><p style="">The song selection interface, dubbed the "Music Library," is much more robust than the interface found in <i>Rock Band 2</i>, which was based on the Rock Band Store's interface. Harmonix recognized that with over 2,000 songs available at launch, <i>Rock Band 3</i> had to make it easier for players to find the tracks that they want to play.</p><p style="">Like <i>Rock Band 2</i>, the music library allows players to sort by a number of categories, like artist, song name, decade, genre, and number of stars earned. However, they also added:</p><ul><li>Sort by Leaderboard Ranking</li><li>Sort by Date Acquired</li><li>Sort by Play Count</li><li>Sort by Review (players can review songs, much like how they can review RBN songs in <i>Rock Band 2</i>)</li></ul><p style="">Beyond sorting, players may also filter songs by multiple simultaneous criteria, like those shown above, as well as showing family-friendly tracks or songs that only have Pro-guitar modes or keyboards. If connected to the music store, the library will also show recommended songs for you to buy based upon the songs that you are browsing or searching for.</p><p style="">Additionally, the music library displays the highest completion percentage and stars that you have earned from playing the song, much like how <i>The Beatles: Rock Band</i> did. When picking a song, you can view a detailed page that will show you your best performances for each difficulty level for each instrument. From that page, you can then choose to play the song, review the song, practice the song, or check your leaderboard rank for that song.</p><p style="">Setlists return in <i>Rock Band 3</i>, though with much more functionality. First, your setlists can be saved and shared with others. You can also challenge your friends to a setlist battle, which is similar to the Battle of the Bands feature in <i>Rock Band 2</i>. The key difference is that you decide the order of songs. While the battle is active, which is customizable, you will try to get the best score of your friends. Lastly, the Party Shuffle feature has the game put together a random setlist from the songs in your library, using your preferences for instruments, song ratings, and play count.</p><h4>Other Features</h4><ul><li><i>Rock Band 3</i> supports independent note highway speeds when players choose different difficulty levels. This means that an expert player's note highway will scroll at expert speeds, even if another player chooses medium or hard difficulty.</li></ul><ul><li>Band scores also include individual instrument scores so each player can see how they did in comparison to the others.</li><li>The user interface allows for players to drop in and out of songs, as well as to change difficulty levels on the fly.</li></ul><h2>Setlist</h2><p style=""><i>Rock Band 3</i> features 83 new songs for consoles, while the Nintendo DS version includes 26. The final setlist was confirmed on August 20, 2010 via a <a href="http://vimeo.com/14293335" rel="nofollow">humorous video made by the developers</a> in response to an earlier song leak.</p><p style="">The video, it should be noted, included a nice Giant Bomb shout out.</p><table class="t-editor with-border full-width"><tbody><tr><th>Artist</th><th>Song Title</th><th>Keyboard</th><th>Harmonies</th><th>Nintendo DS</th></tr><tr><td>Amy Winehouse</td><td>Rehab</td><td>Yes</td><td>3-Part</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Anthrax</td><td>Caught in a Mosh</td><td></td><td>3-Part</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>At the Drive-In</td><td>One Armed Scissor</td><td></td><td>2-Part</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Avenged Sevenfold</td><td>Beast and the Harlot</td><td></td><td>3-Part</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>The B-52s</td><td>Rock Lobster</td><td>Yes</td><td>3-Part</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>The Beach Boys</td><td>Good Vibrations (Live)</td><td>Yes</td><td>3-Part</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Big Country</td><td>In a Big Country</td><td>Yes</td><td>3-Part</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Blondie</td><td>Heart of Glass</td><td>Yes</td><td>2-Part</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers</td><td>Get Up, Stand Up</td><td>Yes</td><td>3-Part</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>The Bronx</td><td>False Alarm</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Chicago</td><td>25 or 6 to 4</td><td>Yes</td><td>3-Part</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>The Cure</td><td>Just Like Heaven</td><td>Yes</td><td>2-Part</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>David Bowie</td><td>Space Oddity</td><td>Yes</td><td>3-Part</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Deep Purple</td><td>Smoke on the Water</td><td>Yes</td><td>2-Part</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Def Leppard</td><td>Foolin'</td><td>Yes</td><td>3-Part</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Devo</td><td>Whip It</td><td>Yes</td><td>2-Part</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Dio</td><td>Rainbow in the Dark</td><td>Yes</td><td>2-Part</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Dire Straits</td><td>Walk of Life</td><td>Yes</td><td>3-Part</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Doobie Brothers</td><td>China Grove</td><td>Yes</td><td>3-Part</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>The Doors</td><td>Break on Through (To the Other Side)</td><td>Yes</td><td></td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Dover</td><td>King George</td><td></td><td>3-Part</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Echo and the Bunnymen</td><td>Killing Moon</td><td>Yes</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Elton John</td><td>Saturday Night's Alright (For Fighting)</td><td>Yes</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Faith No More</td><td>Midlife Crisis</td><td>Yes</td><td>3-Part</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Filter</td><td>Hey Man Nice Shot</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>The Flaming Lips</td><td>Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots, Pt. 1</td><td>Yes</td><td>3-Part</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Foreigner</td><td>Cold as Ice</td><td>Yes</td><td>3-Part</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Golden Earring</td><td>Radar Love</td><td>Yes</td><td>3-Part</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>H.I.M.</td><td>Killing Loneliness</td><td>Yes</td><td>3-Part</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Huey Lewis and The News</td><td>The Power of Love</td><td>Yes</td><td>3-Part</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Hypernova</td><td>Viva La Resistance</td><td></td><td>2-Part</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Ida Maria</td><td>Oh My God</td><td>Yes</td><td>3-Part</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>INXS</td><td>Need You Tonight</td><td>Yes</td><td>3-Part</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>The J.

The export costs $10 for Xbox 360, Playstation 3, and Wii. Unlike Rock Band 1's export feature, songs will not be ripped from the game disc itself. Instead, players use the "Get More Songs" option from the Rock Band 3 main menu, and choose to "Redeem Code." They then use the code found on the back of the Rock Band 2 game manual, which is the same code that was used to download 20 free songs in Rock Band 2 when it launched. That gives the player the option to download the Rock Band 2 Export Pack, which is 1.93 GB in size. Most songs are available for export, but the following songs are excluded:</p><ul><li>Abnormality - "Visions"</li><li>AC/DC - "Let There Be Rock"</li><li>Anarchy Club - "Get Clean"</li><li>Bang Camaro - "Night Lies"</li><li>Breaking Wheel - "Shoulder to the Plow"</li><li>Journey - "Any Way You Want It"</li><li>Libyans - "Welcome to the Neighborhood"</li><li>The Main Drag - "A Jagged Gorgeous Winter"</li><li>Metallica - "Battery"</li><li>Red Hot Chili Peppers - "Give It Away"</li><li>Soundgarden - "Spoonman"</li><li>Speck - "Conventional Lover"</li><li>The Sterns - "Supreme Girl"</li><li>That Handsome Devil - "Rob the Prez-O-Dent"</li></ul><p style="">The Abnormality, Anarchy Club, Bang Camaro, Breaking Wheel, Libyans, The Main Drag, Speck, The Sterns, and That Handsome Devil songs are available as a separate free DLC pack from the Rock Band Store.</p><h4>DLC Pricing, &amp; Legacy Upgrades</h4><ul><li>Due to the changes in how <i>Rock Band 3</i>-compatible DLC files are written, DLC released after <i>Rock Band 3</i>'s release are not compatible with <i>Rock Band</i> and <i>Rock Band 2</i>, effectively ending support for those two games.</li><li>DLC pricing is still $1.99 for songs with keyboards (both basic &amp; Pro), pro drums, &amp; harmonies. For those who want pro-guitar and pro-bass, they buy a separate expansion for $.99 after purchasing the song. Not all songs receive Pro guitar &amp; Pro bass support, but several older DLC songs have received pro-guitar/bass upgrades (e.g. "My Sharona," and "Pretty Noose").</li></ul><h2>Avatar Awards</h2><p style=""><i>Rock Band 3</i> sports five <a data-ref-id="3015-3749" href="/avatar-awards/3015-3749/" slug="avatar-awards">avatar awards</a>.</p><ul><li><strong><i><b>Rock Band</b></i> Keyboards T-Shirt</strong> - <em>5 Star on Easy Pro Keys (or 3 Star on a higher difficulty) any 25 <i>Rock Band 3</i> songs.</em></li><li><strong><i><b>Rock Band</b></i> Drum T-Shirt</strong> - <em>5 Star on Easy Drums (or 3 Star on a higher difficulty) any 25 Rock Band 3 songs.</em></li><li><strong><i><b>Rock Band</b></i> Bass T-Shirt</strong> - <em>5 Star on Easy Bass (or 3 Star on a higher difficulty) any 25 Rock Band 3 songs.</em></li><li><strong><i><b>Rock Band</b></i> Guitar T-Shirt</strong> - <em>5 Star on Easy Guitar (or 3 Star on a higher difficulty) any 25 Rock Band 3 songs.</em></li><li><strong><i><b>Rock Band</b></i> Microphone T-Shirt</strong> - <em>5 Star on Easy Vocals (or 3 Star on a higher difficulty) any 25 Rock Band 3 songs.</em></li></ul><h2>Pre-Order Bonuses</h2><ul><li><b>Gamestop</b>: People who pre-ordered the game from Gamestop received a code to download three DLC songs: "My Own Summer" by Deftones, "Blue Monday" by New Order," and "Burning Down the House" by Talking Heads.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Amazon</b>: People who pre-ordered the game from Amazon received a code for an exclusive in-game guitar.

The script was written by Alex Garland, the author of <a href="http://www.screened.com/the-beach/16-195042/" rel="nofollow">The Beach</a> and <a href="http://www.screened.com/28-days-later/16-11510/" rel="nofollow">28 Days Later</a>, and is loosely based on the ancient Chinese novel 'Journey to the West' ( <a href="http://www.animevice.com/dragon-ball/10-1/" rel="nofollow">Dragon Ball</a> is also very loosely based on this novel). <a href="/andy-serkis/3040-90170/" data-ref-id="3040-90170">Andy Serkis</a>, the director of <a href="/heavenly-sword/3030-7876/" data-ref-id="3030-7876">Heavenly Sword</a>, returns as the director and is also motion capturing the lead protagonist, <a href="/monkey/3005-16479/" data-ref-id="3005-16479">Monkey</a>.</p><p style="">The game is set on Earth, after it has been destroyed by a global robot war. Although the war has ended, robots still roam the planet searching for, killing, or capturing humans. Although a lot of games set in a post-apocalyptic landscape have quite a dark and decrepit look, Enslaved has a very natural art design. The cities the player traverses, rather than being devoid of life, are overrun by nature and are quite colourful. The game follows the story of Monkey, a man who has been enslaved by a woman called <a href="/trip/3005-16505/" data-ref-id="3005-16505">Trip</a> who needs him to help her get home. Because Monkey likes to travel alone, Trip has resorted to using a "Slave Headband" she hacked to administer a paralyzing dose of systemic pain if he fails to follow her orders or tries to remove it himself. In the event of her death, the dosage of pain is lethal. These characters are loosely based on Sun Wukong, the Monkey King, and Xuanzang/Guanyin from the classic Chinese epic "Journey to the West" in which the Monkey King (who uses an extending pole to fight just like Monkey) is tricked into putting on an enchanted headband that will crush his head if he disobeys. This game marks the first time this story has been told in a video game since 2001's <a href="/saiyuki-journey-west/3030-20431/" data-ref-id="3030-20431"><i>Saiyuki</i></a> for the PS1.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">The player takes control of Monkey, with Trip being controlled by the game's <a href="/artificial-intelligence/3015-218/" data-ref-id="3015-218">A.I.</a>. Enslaved's gameplay is quite similar to <i>Heavenly Sword</i>'s, or most <a href="/hack-and-slash/3015-469/" data-ref-id="3015-469">hack and slash</a> games. However, <a href="/ninja-theory-ltd/3010-3909/" data-ref-id="3010-3909">Ninja Theory</a> have said combat is much more tactical and slower paced, with the player needing to use gadgets to scout ahead and plan their movement and attacks. Trip achieves this using a small, robotic dragonfly, which can be controlled remotely to search areas for enemies. The position of enemies is then displayed on the player's HUD, allowing them to avoid confrontation by sneaking past them, if they should choose to. It is also possible for Trip to project a shiny hologram as a distraction while Monkey sneaks up on enemies to take them down from behind. While Monkey can use health packs scattered throughout levels, Trip can also heal Monkey when instructed with limited health pick ups.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/1311846-screenshot_5f00_00005.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1311846" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="960" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 960px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/1311846-screenshot_5f00_00005.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1311846"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/3/30036/1311846-screenshot_5f00_00005.jpg"></a><figcaption>Monkey attacking an enemy from a distance.</figcaption></figure><p style=""><a href="/real-time-combat/3015-2332/" data-ref-id="3015-2332">Combat</a> in the game involves Monkey's <a href="/martial-arts/3015-515/" data-ref-id="3015-515">martial arts</a> skills and his weapons, which include a retractable metal staff, and electronic gloves which can shield himself and Trip from attacks. Monkey's attacks ranges from light to heavy attacks, and by focusing his energy he is able to penetrate enemy shields. It is also possible to use Monkey's climbing skills to ambush enemy robots. Trip is not involved in any offensive combat, but can use a portable EMP device to temporarily stun or distract enemies - giving her time to escape from their attacks and for Monkey to attack them.</p><p style="">As you progress through the game, you will find glowing red orbs scattered throughout the environment. These orbs are referred to as "tech", and are the game's equivalent of experience points, which you use to upgrade Monkey's various abilities. The four main upgrade branches are Shield, Combat, Health, and Staff, with several subdivisions in each one. Tech is also awarded for every enemy you kill.</p><p style="">The other collectible in the game are mysterious masks, which triggers "glitches" in Monkey's headband.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style="">Enslaved is set on Earth, 150 years in the future, after a global war between humans and mechs has all but destroyed civilization. The mechs have won the war and roam the remnants of human society, as the remainder of the human race set up tiny societies of their own. The mechs programming remains, however, and they attack all humans on sight.</p><p style="">The game begins with Monkey imprisoned on a slave ship that is about to crash. Trapped in his containment cell, Monkey sees Trip, a teenage girl, pass by before an explosion frees him. He follows her through the ship and the two manage to escape amidst the chaos via an escape pod. Their landing knocks Monkey unconscious, who awakes to find a mind-controlling headband attached to his forehead. Trip now has control of his actions, and any disobeying results in a painful electric shock. She also explains to him that if her heart stops, he will die as well. She apologizes before promising to free him if he can get her back to her village safely, over 300 miles away. Monkey, seeing little choice, agrees to take her through the remains of New York City, to the slave ship's crash site to find his transport (a futuristic motorcyle). Along the way, glitches in the headband allow Monkey to see images of the world before it was ruined (through real-life photographs).</p><p style="">Once the pair reach the crash site, they board Monkey's transport and drive the rest of the way to Trip's village. There they find the village completely overrun with mechs. After they clear the village, Monkey and Trip break into the village's safe room to find her father lying dead in a chair, and no other villagers. A recording of her father plays, saying that she was always so resourceful and that he was always proud of her. As he expresses his love for his daughter one last time, Trip vows to find the person responsible for his death. She apologizes that she must break her promise to Monkey, but commands him to join her in her quest for vengeance. She seems truly remorseful for this, but Monkey reassures her that he understands completely.</p><p style="">Trip and Monkey head out to meet up with one of her father's friends, Pigsy, who may be able to help them in their new journey. They find Pigsy in his junkyard home, and he agrees to join them, before mentioning that the mechs have been collecting scrap from his junkyard for the past six months to build an enormous mech weapon that Pigsy calls Leviathan at the bottom of the ocean. Pigsy, Trip, and Monkey board Pigsy's airship, and they tail a salvage ship to find where Leviathan is being built. They infiltrate the base and and free Leviathan of it's restraints. Pigsy commandeers it, and the three begin their long journey towards Pyramid, the main base of the slavers who attacked Trip's village. Trip apologizes again to Monkey for enslaving him, and reluctantly frees him. Monkey asks her to reactivate the headband, because he refuses to abandon her now.</p><p style="">Once Leviathan reaches Pyramid, they are confronted by a group of massive scorpion-mechs, but Leviathan manages to hold most of them off. One scorpion manages to climb onto Leviathan's back and destroy its cannon, forcing Monkey to head up and confront it single-handedly. After a long battle, Monkey manages to destroy the giant mech, but Leviathan is now defenseless, and more mechs are approaching. Pigsy states that the only way to destroy the opposition now is to overload the engines to cause a massive explosion. Realizing that this means that Pigsy is attempting to sacrifice himself, Trip begins to panic. Pigsy tells Monkey to grab her and escape the blast radius. Monkey respectfully complies, and they manage to escape the Leviathan just in time to watch it destroy all of Pyramids mechs.</p><p style="">Monkey and Trip finally enter Pyramid to discover that the slavers are headed by a single individual. This man introduces himself as Pyramid, and explains that he was a man who lived before the war with the mechs, and his memories are all that remain of the world as it was. He has been kidnapping the remaining humans and attaching them to his memories via the slave headbands, offering them solace in a virtual world. He believes he is saving them, and pleads with Monkey and Trip not to take away what he's given them. Monkey accuses Pyramid of forsaking and destroying the new world in the name of the old world, and realizes that the glitches he's been experiencing have been visions of Pyramid's memories. Pyramid offers Monkey a mask to see the world as it was, and Monkey becomes enthralled in the "beautiful" world he is presented. The images fade before his eyes, however, as Trip violently disconnects Pyramid from his life support, killing him and destroying the virtual world in the process. The game ends with Trip asking Monkey if she did the right thing, as the slaves around them, disconnected from the memories, begin to awaken in the real world.</p><h2>Voice Talents</h2><ul><li><a href="/andy-serkis/3040-90170/" data-ref-id="3040-90170">Andy Serkis</a> -- <a href="/monkey/3005-16479/" data-ref-id="3005-16479"><b>Monkey</b></a> <b>/ "Pyramid"</b></li><li><a href="/lindsey-shaw/3040-98868/" data-ref-id="3040-98868">Lindsey Shaw</a> -- <a href="/trip/3005-16505/" data-ref-id="3005-16505"><b>Trip</b></a></li><li><a href="/richard-ridings/3040-3934/" data-ref-id="3040-3934">Richard Ridings</a> -- <a href="/pigsy/3005-16856/" data-ref-id="3005-16856"><b>Pigsy</b></a></li></ul><h2>Downloadable Content</h2><h3>Pigsy's Perfect 10</h3><p style="">Pigsy's Perfect 10 is the first piece of DLC that was released for Enslaved: Odyssey to the West and takes place some time before <a href="/pigsy/3005-16856/" data-ref-id="3005-16856">Pigsy</a> meets up with <a href="/monkey/3005-16479/" data-ref-id="3005-16479">Monkey</a> and <a href="/trip/3005-16505/" data-ref-id="3005-16505">Trip</a>. It introduces a new character, Truffles, and gives some insight into what Pigsy's life was like before he is first encountered in the main storyline. It was released on November 23, 2010 for the Xbox 360 and the Playstation 3 for $9.99. It offered 3D support for gamers with 3D capable televisions.</p><h4>Story</h4><p style="">Pigsy's Perfect 10 begins with Pigsy alone in his junkyard home, Pigsy Land, with his floating robotic companion, Truffles. Pigsy laments to himself that life can be lonely in a junkyard, with killing mechs his only means of entertainment. Pigsy sets out to build himself a new "companion" and sets out to find the 3 parts he needs to complete it.</p><p style="">Along the way, Pigsy discovers that the mechs have been encroaching on his land, and a large number of salvage ships are gathering up his scrap metal to make new mechs. Eventually, Pigsy manages to find the three parts he needs, but not before Truffles gets hit by a mech's sniper shot. The two head for home, but Truffles is unable to hold out and dies in the middle of the wasteland. Pigsy promises to come back and fix Truffles after he builds his new companion, since that was the whole point of their adventure.</p><p style="">After creating a fembot companion for himself, Pigsy unceremoniously realizes that it won't turn on. He admits that he forgot one last part in his design, a heart. Every living thing needs a heart. Pigsy heads back to the wasteland and grabs Truffles, and uses Truffles as the companion's heart. This serves to fix both robots, but Truffles is not used to his new body and accidentally trashes Pigsy's home. As Pigsy becomes to clean up, the mechs come and kidnap Truffles, sending waves of mechs after Pigsy.</p><p style="">Once Pigsy sets up his turret and destroys the intruders, he vows to find his friend and bring him home once and for all. As he follows the salvage ship that kidnapped Truffles, a dog mech appears and attacks Pigsy. A long chase ensues, and Pigsy manages to collapse a tunnel on the metal mutt. This is the same dog that attacks Monkey and Trip in the main game, after finally freeing itself.</p><p style="">Pigsy manages to enter the salvage ship and follow Truffles through the mechanisms inside. He finally tracks down his friend and removes him from the companion bot. As he carries his friend home, he continuously apologizes for not appreciating him, and continues to assure Truffles that he is all the friend Pigsy has ever needed. Truffles smiles before blinking out forever. Pigsy sets down his friend and places a flower on him, lamenting that Truffles would have done anything for him, because that's what friends do.

Port Carverton is "on the other side of the mountain" from San Vanelona. Unlike the previous game, Port Carverton is not built as one large environment, but instead as a series of three large areas that you can travel between using the game's menu. These areas are: Industrial, University and Downtown.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10831/1359188-cf.png" data-ref-id="1300-1359188" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.4090909090909" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:140.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10831/1359188-cf.png" data-ref-id="1300-1359188"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10831/1359188-cf.png"></a><figcaption>Coach Frank will get you started. His wristbands teach you the basics.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The story of Skate 3 has you filling the shoes of a returning legendary skater who is looking to set up a new skate team. As you play, you'll recruit new (custom-created) skaters for your team, and as you complete goals, you'll see <a data-ref-id="3055-8" href="/skateboard/3055-8/" slug="skateboard">board</a> sales rise. As you hit sales milestones, more goals and areas will open up to you. In the beginning, you'll have the option of going through a tutorial, which is anchored by a character named <a data-ref-id="3005-13969" href="/coach-frank/3005-13969/" slug="coach-frank">Coach Frank</a>. Coach Frank is voiced by and based on famous pro skater-turned-actor <a data-ref-id="3040-15644" href="/jason-lee/3040-15644/" slug="jason-lee">Jason Lee</a>. The coach will also appear on the game's loading screens with occasional tips and other information. Real-life skate photographers <a data-ref-id="3040-63766" href="/atiba-jefferson/3040-63766/" slug="atiba-jefferson">Atiba Jefferson</a> and <a data-ref-id="3005-8773" href="/giovanni-reda/3005-8773/" slug="giovanni-reda">Giovanni Reda</a>, who were featured in previous titles, also return in limited roles. Reda will no longer be reprising his role as the players personal photographer. This role will now be filled by a NPC skater from the previous games called Shingo. Reda instead appoints himself to a managerial role in the player's new brand and checks in on the player to give him new information and progress the story.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">Skate 3 puts an increased focus on online by offering a new co-op career mode. Like the other online modes, it can be played by up to six players. Some goals present the skate team with a list of tasks that must be completed, regardless of which skater completes them. Others, like photo goals, require each skater to complete the task before the goal is cleared. Photo goals create new opportunity for hijinks, as skaters can stand or skate into each others' photos. The photos you select are occasionally placed around Port Carverton on billboards and other surfaces.</p><p style="">Skate 3 attempts to create a social connection with the players on your friends list by popping up messages in your "skate.feed" as you play. The messages will inform you when a friend completes a goal, among other things. You can also import your friends' created skaters for use in your career's skate team. As with previous games in the series, certain UI elements, including the feed's ticker, are covered in branding for a popular cell phone provider.</p><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1284718-bbp_cole_bsnoseblunt1_resize_noscale.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1284718" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1284718-bbp_cole_bsnoseblunt1_resize_noscale.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1284718"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33529/1284718-bbp_cole_bsnoseblunt1_resize_noscale.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33529/1284718-bbp_cole_bsnoseblunt1_resize_noscale.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>You can now create your own skateparks.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The "flick it" control system from <a data-ref-id="3030-20661" href="/skate-2/3030-20661/" slug="skate-2">Skate 2</a> returns in Skate 3 with two new enhancements. By using the "grab the world" button (RB on 360) in conjunction with a kickflip, the skater can catch the board mid-flip with the board paint-side-up for a darkslide. You must flip trick out of a darkslide in order to properly orient the board for landing. You can also perform underflips. After performing a standard flip trick, you can immediately pull the stick in the opposite direction to initiate an underflip. You can also hold either of the triggers to grab your board, and then press either A or X to perform bonelesses, no complies, and also foot plants. The final addition to the skating control system is the ability to drop in from various ramp surfaces. While on foot and approaching a lip, one can press and holding the mount the board button. You will assume the drop in position. Upon releasing the mount the board button (Y or triangle), your skater will drop in fluidly down the ramp.</p><p style="">New goals include camera goals that ask you to place the camera down before attempting to perform specific tricks. The Hall of Meat makes a return (but doesn't activate automatically outside of challenges, as it is an optional feature in this game), as will a fully filmed full-motion video intro movie featuring the game's licensed skaters.</p><p style="">In a Skate series first, players now have access to a full park creation system. This is in contrast to Skate 2, which only allowed the player to use the in game character model to physically move small ramps and rails, Skate 3 adds to this with an item-dropping tool that can be used anywhere (but usually not while engaged in a challenge). Players are be able to drop objects into the game world using a God-hand interface, unlock objects by progressing through the game, as well as unlock various types of environments in which to build your teams own private facility.</p><p style="">The graphics editor has also been overhauled. An updated version of the web-based graphics editor that accompanied Skate 2 is available online, allowing players to create custom graphics on the Skate website and then import those into Skate 3 for use with their characters' merchandise.</p><p style="">Another new aspect of the game this year is the introduction of difficulty modes, with players being able to choose between 'Easy', 'Normal' and 'Hardcore' mode respectively. 'Normal' mode is pretty self explanatory, with similar game play to be found in Skate 2. 'Easy' mode dumbs down the physics and adds increased suction into grinds for those not wanting much of a challenge, while 'Hardcore' mode is the complete opposite, drastically increasing the weight of the skater and lowering the height of ollies, as well as almost completely turning off CPU assists in lining up grinds and pumping transitions on vert ramps (which is critical for maintaining speed). This feature turns the game into an almost sim-like recreation of skateboarding, something which real-life skaters and long time fans of the series have been requesting Black Box to include since the first game was released in 2008.</p><h2>Community Features</h2><p style="">Skate 3, like its predecessor's, includes a robust set of features aimed at sharing, rating, and playing content created by you, your friends, and the rest of the world. Players can view and rate photos, movies, created graphics, and created skate parks, with the highest rated of each being featured on the Skate.Feed that all players see when first booting up the game.</p><p style="">A new feature added in Skate 3 is the ability to create Skate teams that can work together to complete certain storyline challenges, or compete against other skate teams in online competitions.</p><h2>Final list of skaters</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id="3005-12166" href="/mark-appleyard/3005-12166/" slug="mark-appleyard">Mark Appleyard</a></li></ul><ul><li><a data-ref-id="3005-12181" href="/ray-barbee/3005-12181/" slug="ray-barbee">Ray Barbee</a></li><li>Joey Brezinski</li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-12151" href="/dennis-busenitz/3005-12151/" slug="dennis-busenitz">Dennis Busenitz</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-5354" href="/john-cardiel/3005-5354/" slug="john-cardiel">John Cardiel</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3040-71903" href="/mike-carrol/3040-71903/" slug="mike-carrol">Mike Carrol</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3040-9504" href="/chris-cole/3040-9504/" slug="chris-cole">Chris Cole</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-11735" href="/jason-dill/3005-11735/" slug="jason-dill">Jason Dill</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-13968" href="/dan-drehobl/3005-13968/" slug="dan-drehobl">Dan Drehobl</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-5352" href="/rob-dyrdek/3005-5352/" slug="rob-dyrdek">Rob Dyrdek</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3040-67085" href="/patrick-duffy/3040-67085/" slug="patrick-duffy">Pat Duffy</a></li><li>Benny Fairfax</li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-12155" href="/ryan-gallant/3005-12155/" slug="ryan-gallant">Ryan Gallant</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3040-89792" href="/chris-haslam/3040-89792/" slug="chris-haslam">Chris Haslam</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-11733" href="/jerry-hsu/3005-11733/" slug="jerry-hsu">Jerry Hsu</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-15132" href="/josh-kalis/3005-15132/" slug="josh-kalis">Josh Kalis</a></li></ul><ul><li><a data-ref-id="3005-12154" href="/terry-kennedy/3005-12154/" slug="terry-kennedy">Terry Kennedy</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-6031" href="/eric-koston/3005-6031/" slug="eric-koston">Eric Koston</a></li><li>P.J.

The title was co-developed between <a href="/5pb/3010-6483/" data-ref-id="3010-6483">5pb.</a> and <a href="/nitroplus/3010-6446/" data-ref-id="3010-6446">Nitroplus </a>and was initially released for the <a href="/xbox-360/3045-20/" data-ref-id="3045-20">Xbox 360</a> in Japan on October 15, 2009. Ports were later made for the <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC </a>in 2010, <a href="/psp/3045-18/" data-ref-id="3045-18">PSP</a>/<a href="/iphone/3045-96/" data-ref-id="3045-96">iOS</a> in 2011, <a href="/playstation-network-ps3/3045-88/" data-ref-id="3045-88">PS3</a> in 2012, and <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/playstation-vita/3045-129/" data-ref-id="3045-129">PS Vita</a> in 2013. Steins;Gate's success has led to the creation of several spin-off titles and other related media, which has established Steins;Gate as it's own <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/steinsgate-series/3025-2128/" data-ref-id="3025-2128">franchise</a> outside the Science Adventure series.</p><h2>English Release</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">A group of fans began creating an unofficial English translation patch for the PC port of Steins;Gate in June of 2011. After several months of work the project was cancelled in January 2012 but a rough incomplete draft of the team's translation was released to the public in September 2011. However years later, <a href="/jast-usa/3010-1591/" data-ref-id="3010-1591">JAST USA </a>announced at Anime Expo 2013 that they would be publishing the PC version of Steins;Gate and that the script was being translated by the same group that created the 2011 fan patch. JAST USA published three different releases of Steins;Gate with a limited edition and a download version released on March 31, 2014 and a regular physical release published on April 30, 2014. Later in 2015 the UK based publisher <a href="/pqube/3010-6964/" data-ref-id="3010-6964">pQube </a>released the PS3 and Vita ports of Steins;Gate in Britain as well as in the United States.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure style="width: 320px" data-ref-id="1300-2621683" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/97089/2621683-untitled.png" data-size="small" data-align="right" data-ratio="0.56266666666667" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/97089/2621683-untitled.png" data-ref-id="1300-2621683"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/9/97089/2621683-untitled.jpg"></a><figcaption>Akihabara </figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The game is set in Akihabara, <a href="/tokyo/3035-1341/" data-ref-id="3035-1341">Tokyo</a>, during the summer of 2010 and follows a group of friends who have modified a <a href="/microwave/3055-2827/" data-ref-id="3055-2827">microwave</a> to send <a href="/cell-phone/3055-342/" data-ref-id="3055-342">mobile</a> text messages <a href="/time-manipulation-device/3055-4158/" data-ref-id="3055-4158">back in time</a>.

The only information on the story so  far  is this translated prologue:<br/> <br/>AD2200/Jan <br/> <br/>A   few days have passed since the reported raid by Ragna the Bloodedge , the SS-class Librarium traitor with the highest bounty in history, alias   "Grim Reaper".

The name Ragna the Bloodedge is engraved in the minds   of the people.<br/><br/>Completely indifferent to the state of the city,   the silver-haired Grim Reaper grips his massive sword and quietly bides   his time, waiting for the chance to achieve his true objective.<br/><br/>And   then, the enormous power that has ensnared the Grim Reaper begins   to activate...   <br/><br/></p><h2>General Changes  </h2>General changes for BlazBlue: Continuum Shift that are of note  include: <br/><br/> <ul class="plain-list"><li>Rebalancing of all  characters.</li><li>All astral Heats unlocked immediately.<br/> </li><li>General decrease in combo damage.<br/> </li><li>New moves for  all characters.</li><li>Auto break on moves that freeze.<br/> </li><li>Unable to jump with barrier on.<br/> </li><li>Movable time after winning shortened.<br/></li><li>Delay on back dash after jump.<br/></li><li>Better animation.</li><li>  New effects, new system  voice.</li><li> New  pictures for character select  screen.<br/> </li><li>Cross-platform player rankings (no cross platform play).</li><li>Story mode will be 1.5 to 2 times bigger than Calamity Trigger.</li><li>The game will be patchable for character balance.</li><li>Arcade fight request system added.</li></ul><br/><h2>New and Improved Game Modes</h2>BlazBlue: Continuum Shift also includes a number of new game modes.

Replacing the; A (Light attack), B (Medium attack), C (Heavy  attack) and D (Drive) buttons, beginners  will have access to; N (Normal attack), H (Heavy attack), S (Special)  and T (Throw) buttons. (It is not possible to break burst in beginner mode).<br/> <br/>This works similarly to <a href="///">                                                                                                                                   Tatsunoko vs Capcom</a> on the <a href="///">                                                                                                                                 Wii</a>,  where if you were using a Wii remote the game allowed for simple  command inputs for complex moves/combos.<br/> <br/>By rapidly tapping the  "N" button the player can easily initiate a combo, the "H" button can  then be used during the combo to mix in other attacks. This system is  intended to make game play far more rewarding for newer players.<br/> <br/>The  "S" button is used for character specific special moves, pressing the  "S" button while holding the analog stick or D-pad in different  positions will result in a different special move being used. <br/> <br/>The  "T" button is pretty self explanatory, it is used to throw opponents,  but can also be used to throw reject your opponents. <br/> <br/>Finally,  holding down either the "N" or "S" buttons will activate the character's  distortion drive.  <br/><br/><h2>Returning Characters<br/></h2>All playable characters (and some non-playable NPCs) return this time around for the game's extensive story mode, which directly follows the True Ending of Calamity Trigger. Some of these characters have undergone changes to their move sets.<br/> <br/><h3><a data-ref-id="3005-7830" href="/ragna-the-bloodedge/3005-7830/" slug="ragna-the-bloodedge"> <b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b>             Ragna the Bloodedge</b></a><br/></h3>Escaped the Library after surviving the fight against V-13    and then against Hazama.

Lessons<br/> <h2>New Fight Mechanics<br/></h2>There are a number of changes to the tried and tested fight mechanics this time around too. These include slight tweaks or complete redesigns of the following:<br/> <br/><h3>Life Gauge<br/></h3>The life gauge will fade from green to yellow to red to better indicate the health of the player. <br/> <figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64737/1418500-life_guage.png" data-ref-id="1300-1418500" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.1120218579235" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:11.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64737/1418500-life_guage.png" data-ref-id="1300-1418500"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64737/1418500-life_guage.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64737/1418500-life_guage.png"></noscript></a></figure> <br/>  <br/> <br/><h3>Heat Gauge</h3>The heat gauge gets a little makeover but no real change, the only thing different here is that character specific gauges and counts are displayed above it now. <br/> <figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64737/1418499-heatgauge.png" data-ref-id="1300-1418499" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.18181818181818" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:18.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64737/1418499-heatgauge.png" data-ref-id="1300-1418499"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64737/1418499-heatgauge.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64737/1418499-heatgauge.png"></noscript></a></figure>      <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/><h3>Barrier Gauge</h3>Perhaps the most significant change to mechanics is how the barrier system now works. In BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger using a barrier burst would deplete the player's barrier gauge putting them in a "danger" state, making them more vulnerable until the end of the round. This is no longer the case, as the barrier gauge and the new break burst system are no longer linked. The barrier gauge can still be depleted by using it to block attacks and doing so will still result in a "danger" state.<br/> <figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64737/1418493-barrier.png" data-ref-id="1300-1418493" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.1830985915493" data-width="213" style="width: 213px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:18.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64737/1418493-barrier.png" data-ref-id="1300-1418493"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64737/1418493-barrier.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64737/1418493-barrier.png"></noscript></a></figure>      <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/><h3>Break Burst</h3>Break bursts are now governed by their own icons that appear under the player icon. Each player starts the round with 1 burst, they can use this either as a "gold burst" if they are not being attacked in order to bounce their opponent for a combo or as a "green burst" to knock their opponent away if they are being pressured. Players gain a second break burst if they lose a round, this stacks with the first one assuming it hasn't been used for a maximum of 2 break bursts. Using a defensive break burst will however half the maximum amount guard primers you are able to use for that round.<br/> <figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64737/1418495-barrier_burst.png" data-ref-id="1300-1418495" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.52777777777778" data-width="108" style="width: 108px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:52.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64737/1418495-barrier_burst.png" data-ref-id="1300-1418495"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64737/1418495-barrier_burst.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64737/1418495-barrier_burst.png"></noscript></a></figure>      <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>  <br/><h3>Guard Primer</h3>The other significant change in mechanics is the removal of the guard libra gauge and introduction of the guard primer. Different characters will start with different amounts of primers depending on their size and strength, for example the massive Tager will start with a maximum of 10 primer points where as the tiny Carl will start with the minimum of 4. These points are depleted every time an attack with a "guard break" property lands and is blocked. Depletion of all points will put the character in a "guard crush" state giving the other player time to initiate a free combo. Using a barrier will only stop attacks removing the final primer point, but will also cause the attacks that would've removed the final primer to consume more barrier gauge. Guard primers will regenerate slowly over time, flashing before they return. <br/> <figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64737/1418497-guard_primers.png" data-ref-id="1300-1418497" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.16556291390728" data-width="151" style="width: 151px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:16.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64737/1418497-guard_primers.png" data-ref-id="1300-1418497"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64737/1418497-guard_primers.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64737/1418497-guard_primers.png"></noscript></a></figure> <br/> <br/>  <br/>  <h3>Fatal Counter</h3>There is also the introduction of a new "fatal counter" system. A fatal counter occurs when an opponent is hit by specific moves before they have finished their own move. The result is similar to a counter hit (the opponent takes longer to recover), however this is followed by the bonus of an increase in tech time (2 frames) for the opponent on subsequent attacks, meaning longer combos can be initiated from a fatal counter. <br/> <figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64737/1418833-fatalcounter.png" data-ref-id="1300-1418833" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.13740458015267" data-width="262" style="width: 262px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:13.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64737/1418833-fatalcounter.png" data-ref-id="1300-1418833"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64737/1418833-fatalcounter.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64737/1418833-fatalcounter.png"></noscript></a></figure>         <br/> <br/>   <br/><br/><h3>Guard Bonus<br/></h3>Guarding attack strings that last 6 seconds or more will result in all blocks after those 6 seconds becoming automatic instant blocks, until the player is free from the attack string or is hit. <br/> <br/><h3>Negative Penalty<br/></h3>While negative penalty is easier to acquire in BlazBlue: Continuum Shift, the penalty has been reduced from x2 damage to x1.5 damage against the player with negative penalty. <br/> <br/><h3>New Astral Heat Requirements<br/></h3>The final change comes in the  form of a different set of criteria to fill before an astral heat can be  performed. In BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger the following criteria had to  be met; Last round of a match (e.g. 1-1 of 2 rounds to win), 100 heat  and the opponent must be on 20% life or less. The new criteria for  BlazBlue: Continuum Shift are; Last round of the match for the player  attempting the astral finish (e.g. 1-0 or 1-1 of 2 rounds to win), 100  heat, the opponent being on 35% life or less and at least 1 free break  burst icon.   <br/><br/><h2>Versions and Pricing</h2>The PS3 version of the game is region free, meaning it can be played using any PS3 regardless of where it was purchased.

Characters that can be played from the first game are: Leonhardt and his four kids, the heroines from the first game, Ellis, and Dyshana.

All twenty five characters from Street Fighter IV return. Ten additional characters join the game, eight from <a href="../../street-fighter/62-331/" rel="nofollow">Street Fighter</a> games and a pair of all new entrants. The added characters are <a href="../../t-hawk/94-46/" rel="nofollow">T. Hawk</a>, <a href="../../dee-jay/94-4154/" rel="nofollow">Dee Jay</a>, <a href="../../adon/94-2218/" rel="nofollow">Adon</a>, <a href="../../cody-travers/94-319/" rel="nofollow">Cody</a>, <a href="../../guy/94-257/" rel="nofollow">Guy</a>, <a href="../../ibuki/94-3109/" rel="nofollow">Ibuki</a>, <a href="../../dudley/94-3107/" rel="nofollow">Dudley</a>, <a href="../../makoto/94-888/" rel="nofollow">Makoto</a>. The two new characters to the <a href="../../street-fighter/62-331/" rel="nofollow">Street Fighter</a> series are <a href="../../juri/94-12558/" rel="nofollow">Juri</a> and <a href="../../hakan/94-14296/" rel="nofollow">Hakan</a>. All characters are playable from the start meaning there is no need to go through the arcade mode to unlock any characters.</p><p style="">Super Street Fighter IV also adds additional costumes for each character, many of which are drastically different to their two costumes in the previous game. <a href="../../zangief/94-6/" rel="nofollow">Zangief</a>, for example, has a metallic "Mecha <a href="/zangief/3005-6/" data-ref-id="3005-6">Zangief</a>" costume. <a href="../../cammy/94-331/" rel="nofollow">Cammy</a>'s third outfit is what she wore as a brainwashed assassin for <a href="../../shadaloo/92-2812/" rel="nofollow">Shadaloo</a>. <a href="../../dan-hibiki/94-269/" rel="nofollow">Dan</a>'s third takes on a <a href="../../blanka/94-1859/" rel="nofollow">Blanka</a>-like look, signifying the two characters' friendship.</p><p style="">Fighting is significantly tweaked with many of the existing characters seeing the properties of their moves changed in the interest of balance. Each fighter now has two <a href="/ultra-combo/3015-6150/" data-ref-id="3015-6150">Ultra Combos</a>. Like <a href="../../street-fighter-iii/62-1662/" rel="nofollow">Street Fighter III</a> before it, players can select which of the two Ultras they want to use when selecting a fighter. Also like SFIII, the Ultras are denoted as Ultra I and Ultra II.</p><p style="">New game modes have been added to further flesh out the game's online options. These new game modes include a new replay channel, team battles, quarter matches, and a new Tournament mode which was released via free DLC.</p><h2>New Characters</h2><h3><a href="../../adon/94-2218/" rel="nofollow">Adon</a></h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1199565-picture_7_noscale.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1199565" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.56288916562889" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1199565-picture_7_noscale.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1199565"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33529/1199565-picture_7_noscale.jpg"></a><figcaption>Adon</figcaption></figure><p style="">One of the most "OG" characters in the history of Street Fighter, Adon made his first appearance in the original Street Fighter, along with Gen and Sagat.

Interviews have stated that they've toned down the background's color to make it easier on the eyes in Super Street Fighter IV.</p><h2>Game Modes</h2><p style="">This <a href="../../the-new-modes-of-super-street-fighter-iv/17-1604/" rel="nofollow">video</a> shows that Super Street Fighter IV has an assortment of gameplay modes for you to choose from, whether it be single player or multiplayer.</p><h3>Arcade Mode</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/431/1225174-bonus_stage.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1225174" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/431/1225174-bonus_stage.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1225174"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/431/1225174-bonus_stage.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/431/1225174-bonus_stage.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Barrel Bonus Stage</figcaption></figure><p style="">Battle against the artificial intelligence in this one-player game mode. The arcade mode is where the player is fed cut-scenes pertaining to the characters story that you've chosen. There are typically a set number of stages, followed by a boss battle at the end. In addition, if hidden requirements are met you may be able to fight secret boss characters, however it has not been confirmed that these in SSFIV. Bonus Stages appear in arcade mode, to break up the action at specific times. The bonus stages included in SSFIV are beating up a car within the time limit, and destroying as many descending barrels within the time limit.</p><h3>Versus Mode</h3><p style="">This is your primary option for player vs. player matches in offline environments. You can set various options such as time, rounds, and handicap from here. The battling is 100% Street Fighter, and puts your skills to the test against a live opponent in the same room as you.</p><h3>Ranked Match</h3><p style="">Ranked matches make a return in Super Street Fighter IV, but not without its share of changes. There are two types of points to obtain in this mode, which are both tied to your wins/losses. In SFIV, Battle Points (BP) were your overall skill level as a player, but in Super they are character specific. This will better gauge how good someone is with a particular character, and allow you to experiment with characters you are less familiar with, and not have fear of stronger ranked characters defeating you easily. Player Points (PP) replace the old Battle Points, and represent the culmination of your skill level as a player in general. You may upload a replay of a ranked battle after three wins in a row.</p><h3>Endless Battle</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/431/1225166-endless_battle.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1225166" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/431/1225166-endless_battle.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1225166"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/431/1225166-endless_battle.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/431/1225166-endless_battle.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Endless Battle Lobby</figcaption></figure><p style="">Super Street Fighter IV's version of the "quarter match", Endless Battle allows you to gather seven other players (for a total of eight) into one online game lobby, and take turns playing in 1 on 1 battles, while the other players wait for their turn and spectate the match that is underway. Voice chat is available to all in this game mode, allowing for you to discuss strategies and offer tips simultaneously as two fighters go at it. The winner of the battle will stay in the fight, the loser will go the the bottom of the list and will have to wait for his turn to arise again, against the current champion. This mode is strictly for casual play, and as such there is no end (as the name implies), and games have no effect on battle or player points.</p><h3>Team Battle</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/431/1225172-team_battle.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1225172" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/431/1225172-team_battle.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1225172"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/431/1225172-team_battle.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/431/1225172-team_battle.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Team Battle Lobby</figcaption></figure><p style="">This mode once again utilizes up to eight people in a lobby, but lets you organize teams and play tournament-style battles against one another. The teams can be organized in any fashion, such as 4v4, 5v3, 6v2, or even 7v1, but can be started with smaller teams such as 2v2. Players can set up teams manually, or have them sorted out automatically based on player points (the new point system that is being implemented into the online mode of Super Street Fighter IV). The two teams are Team Red and Team Blue, and like Endless Battle you can chat amongst teammates while waiting for your turn to fight. This is actually be one of the modes available to you in the "arcade request" feature that was also in Street Fighter IV.</p><h3>Replay Channel</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/431/1225173-replay_channel.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1225173" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/431/1225173-replay_channel.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1225173"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/431/1225173-replay_channel.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/431/1225173-replay_channel.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Replay Channel</figcaption></figure><p style="">This channel is for viewing replays, which you can filter by specific categories. You can invite up to seven other viewers to your own replay channel, and watch specific replays together and comment on the match taking place. You can save your own replays at any time in Super Street Fighter IV, and these will go under "My List." You cannot have spectators in replay channel while viewing your own saved replays, since they are on your harddrive. The replays also have a built-in rating system, in the form of a 5-star scale.</p><h3>Tournament Mode (DLC)</h3><p style="">This mode shares many similarities to the tournament mode in <a href="../../super-street-fighter-ii-turbo-hd-remix/61-20616/" rel="nofollow">Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix</a>. It was released as DLC on June 15th, 2010. You can get up to eight other players together in this mode and host custom tournaments, making for a total of 9 people in a tournament (since one is the tournament organizer). You can spectate all the tournament matches, and even save them as replays, you don't even have to be participating in the match to save the replay. Rounding off the experience is visual tournament brackets and results, and awards given to the player who win a tournament (in the form of titles and the like).</p><h2>Gameplay changes</h2><ul><li>Modifications have made for improved balance between characters; for example Ry's Dragon Punch now has the potential to hit twice.</li><li>A new "wall bounce" mechanic has been implemented.</li><li>Every character has 2 separate Ultra moves, some that are executable in the air.</li><li>Focus Attacks still have levels like they do in Street Fighter IV (1/2/3) but, according to Capcom's <a href="/seth-killian/3040-85792/" data-ref-id="3040-85792">Seth Killian</a>, they now charge faster.

Fans will still have to wait 3 months from the day the last individual pack is released until the Complete Pack comes out.</p><h3>Getting the latest costume packs to everyone</h3><p style="">Unlike the first set of alternate costumes to be released for Super Street Fighter 4, these sets of costumes are not on the disc. Therefore, they are not available for everyone to see with the original game disc. <a href="/capcom/3010-367/" data-ref-id="3010-367">Capcom</a> has remedied this by releasing a mandatory patch that will enable users to see costumes they have not purchased, provided they have downloaded the "Catalogue" items for their system.</p><p style="">The "Catalogue" download item essentially puts costume packs in your game so you can see costumes you have not purchased while other players use them. If you do not download the "Catalogue" pack, a short message will appear saying that the user is using a costume that you do not have access to. It will then default to an original costume. There wil be 2 "Catalogue" packs. The first will be released on October 26th, 2010 and include the first half of the costumes being released. The second will be released on December 21st, 2010 and contain the second half.</p><h2>Arcade Version Controversy</h2><p style="">In an interview given around the time of the game's announcement, <a href="../../yoshinori-ono/72-40187/" rel="nofollow">Yoshinori Ono</a> had stated that Super Street Fighter IV would not see an arcade release, and would instead be an Xbox 360 / Playstation 3 exclusive. The tournament scene was split if the lack of an arcade version was an issue, with petitions created to show fan support for an arcade version.</p><p style="">The debate was finally squashed when Ono himself announced the arcade version of SSFIV at the Street Fighter IV Nationals in Japan.</p><h2>Arcade Edition</h2><h3>Yun and Yang</h3><p style="">During the localization testing for the Super Street Fighter 4 arcade edition, a screenshot was leaked revealing 2 extra character slots to the left of Juri and right of Hakan. This only helped fuel the speculation of DLC Characters for console versions. In September of 2010, the rumored character additions were confirmed to be <a href="/yun/3005-3111/" data-ref-id="3005-3111">Yun</a> &amp; <a href="/yang/3005-3112/" data-ref-id="3005-3112">Yang</a> from <a href="/street-fighter-iii-3rd-strike/3030-1615/" data-ref-id="3030-1615">Street Fighter 3</a>.</p><h3>Evil Ryu and Oni Akuma</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/90134/1744516-evil_ryu_ssf4_ae.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1744516" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="1.3462109955423" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:134.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/90134/1744516-evil_ryu_ssf4_ae.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1744516"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/9/90134/1744516-evil_ryu_ssf4_ae.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/9/90134/1744516-evil_ryu_ssf4_ae.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Evil Ryu SSF4 AE</figcaption></figure><p style="">At the end of the <i>Super Street FIghter 4: Aracde Edition</i> trailer released on December 2nd, 2010, it was revealed that <a href="/">Evil Ryu</a> and <a href="/">Oni</a> would potentially make an appearence in Arcade Edition.</p><p style="">Some time after the release of Arcade Edition some codes weere leaked that allowed the arcade owners to pre-maturely unlock Evil Ryu and Oni (confirmed names).

DLC coming to <a href="/super-street-fighter-iv/3030-28437/" data-ref-id="3030-28437">Super Street Fighter 4</a>. The trailer was quickly removed by Capcom.

The game will also be released as a stand alone product for those who do not own Super Street Fighter 4. The downloadable version will be released June 7th, 2011 and the disc will be released on June 28th.</p><h3>Arcade Edition Costume Pack</h3><p style="">On July 5th, 2011, <a href="/capcom/3010-367/" data-ref-id="3010-367">Capcom</a> announced that they would release a costume pack that included 2 new costumes for the 4 new Arcade Edition fighters.</p><h2>3DS Port of Super Street Fighter 4</h2><p style="">On March 27, 2011, a <a href="/nintendo-3ds/3045-117/" data-ref-id="3045-117">3DS</a> port of the game was released as a launch game for the console. Aside from the obvious addition of 3D visuals, the port added an optional behind-the-back camera angle, four hotkeys for special moves on the touchscreen, and a Streetpass figurine battle system.</p><p style="">The hotkey system was controversial amongst veteran players because it would allow characters to perform charge moves, such as Guile's Flash Kick, immediately, without having to wait for the charge. While this skewed the balance of the game, it was arguably necessary in order to streamline the game for a new audience of portable players. Additionally, players could adjust the hotkey functionality so that this was less of an issue, and filter online matches based on player's hotkey usage style.</p><p style="">Streetpass battles occurred when two people with 3DS's in sleep mode passed each other. No player input would be required to win a battle. Instead, players could unlock different figurines using their accumulated Play Coins, each with different stats, and based on these stats, a winner would be chosen. Upon opening up your 3DS, you would be greeted with a notification that a Streetpass battle had taken place.</p><h2>Arcade Edition on PC</h2><p style="">In an interview with 4gamer.net, SSF4 Producer <a href="/yoshinori-ono/3040-40187/" data-ref-id="3040-40187">Yoshinori Ono</a> said there are no plans to port the latest Street Fighter to PC due to piracy.</p><p style=""><a href="/street-fighter-iv/3030-20456/" data-ref-id="3030-20456">Street Fighter 4</a> for <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC</a> had strong sales worldwide, but it was also number 1 in piracy.

in the US. Although the game was announced on August 17, 2010, speculation of the game had been brewing since 2009, when a billboard advertising the game was spotted on a movie set for <i>Battle: Los Angeles</i>. Resistance 3 was featured in issue 211 of Game Informer magazine with a 10 page article.</p><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5343/1539118-5033653484_0618ff58f1_b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1539118" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5343/1539118-5033653484_0618ff58f1_b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1539118"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5343/1539118-5033653484_0618ff58f1_b.jpg"></a><figcaption>Joseph Capelli</figcaption></figure><p style=""><a href="/nathan-hale/3005-479/" data-ref-id="3005-479" data-mce-href="/nathan-hale/3005-479/">Nathan Hale</a>, the main protagonist of <a href="/resistance-fall-of-man/3030-9741/" data-ref-id="3030-9741" data-mce-href="/resistance-fall-of-man/3030-9741/">Resistance: Fall of Man</a> and <a href="/resistance-2/3030-20699/" data-ref-id="3030-20699" data-mce-href="/resistance-2/3030-20699/">Resistance 2</a>, does not return the lead role for Resistance 3, having been shot in the head and killed at the end of the previous game.

There is no more resistance and the Chimera now have complete control. Joe, Susan, and their young son Jack, and other survivors, try to live normally underground in Haven, <a href="/oklahoma-city/3035-1507/" data-ref-id="3035-1507" data-mce-href="/oklahoma-city/3035-1507/">Oklahoma</a>. However, the Chimera begin attacking Haven, coincidentally when Malikov finally finds Joseph with information regarding the Chimeran. The good doctor explains that when Hale blew up the mothership at the end of the second game, it opened a wormhole to another galaxy. The Chimera are using said wormhole to freeze the planet because they need a colder environment to live in, as previously hinted at by the cooling equipment implanted in their own bodies. Apparently, the main wormhole is in <a href="/new-york-city/3035-109/" data-ref-id="3035-109" data-mce-href="/new-york-city/3035-109/">New York City</a> and despite being reluctant to help Malikov at first, Susan convinces Joe to go after explaining that their sick son will not make it through the endless winter.</p><p style="">Malikov and Capelli travel to <a href="/st-louis/3035-1327/" data-ref-id="3035-1327" data-mce-href="/st-louis/3035-1327/">St. Louis</a>, Missouri where they meet up with another resistance group who lets them get a VITOL ride all the way to Mt. Pleasant, PA. There, Malikov and Joe take a train but are ambushed by humans who call themselves the Wardens. These monsters execute Doctor Malikov and take Joe prisonner and have him fight in gladiator type matches. Joe eventually escapes and makes it to a frozen New York. Realizing that he probably won't make it back alive, he radios his family to say his goodbyes and marches towards the wormhole tower. Despite doing his best, Joe fails at entering the tower, overrun by Chimera just outside the main gates.</p><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/86760/1882796-5b2f4ef930b8f21d037a5c65d8c2362abe8cfc7b.jpg__620x348_q85_crop_upscale.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1882796" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.56129032258065" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/86760/1882796-5b2f4ef930b8f21d037a5c65d8c2362abe8cfc7b.jpg__620x348_q85_crop_upscale.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1882796"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/86760/1882796-5b2f4ef930b8f21d037a5c65d8c2362abe8cfc7b.jpg__620x348_q85_crop_upscale.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/86760/1882796-5b2f4ef930b8f21d037a5c65d8c2362abe8cfc7b.jpg__620x348_q85_crop_upscale.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Joe in New York.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Just as all hope seems lost, the St. Louis resistance comes to save Joe, wishing to bring him back to base. Joe refuses to give up and points at a nearby terraformer which could be crashed into the wormhole tower, thus destroying it. Joe and the resistance infiltrate the tower, sabotage its navigation system and violently crash it into the tower. Joe survives the ordeal and makes it safely back to his family. During the credits, it's revealed that temperatures are rising and that New York City seems to have disappeared. Different resistance groups around the world begin radioing in, saying that the Chimera are retreating.

The game wouldn't be officially announced, however, until the <a href="/gamescom-2010/3015-5840/" data-ref-id="3015-5840" data-mce-href="/gamescom-2010/3015-5840/">2010 Gamescom</a> conference, with a live-action trailer showcasing Joseph Capelli's struggle against the Chimera throughout the bleak and depressing atmosphere of war-torn Missouri.</p><p style="">The gameplay was first revealed in the 2010 Spike TV Awards, depicting Capelli and fellow returning character <a href="/fyodor-malikov/3005-18542/" data-ref-id="3005-18542" data-mce-href="/fyodor-malikov/3005-18542/">Fyodor Malikov</a> traversing across a river on a boat.

Because the setting is based on the aftermath of the war between the Chimeran invaders and Humanity--with the victory going to the Chimera--and ordinary civilians now forced to defend themselves, Resistance 3 was given a much more moody and oppressive colour palette.</p><p style="">Resistance 3 has also been heavily promoted alongside Sony's 3D technology, with the game itself being available in 3D, and also available within a bundle alongside a new 3DTV. Called the Doomsday edition, it also features a Sharpshooter peripheral, a Move controller, a navigation controller, and a Playstation Eye camera.</p><h2>On Disc Bonuses</h2><p style="">To promote Sony's other avenues like Sony Music and Sony Movies, <i>Resistance 3</i>'s bluray contains a myriad of miscellaneous content, including music videos, movie trailers and video game demos.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">Resistance 3 retains the series' fast paced shooting, pitting <a href="/joseph-capelli/3005-17849/" data-ref-id="3005-17849" data-mce-href="/joseph-capelli/3005-17849/">Capelli</a> up against the Chimera in the single player campaign. Notable differences from previous games include the removal of the series' signature 'quadrant' health regeneration, in both single player and multiplayer, and the return of the weapon wheel from the original, replacing <i>Resistance 2</i>'s limit of carrying only two weapons. To also reflect the makeshift nature of the setting, grenades in Resistance 3 are made from bean cans filled with nails. The game gives three different outset difficulties to choose from, with an unlockable fourth once the campaign has been completed on any of the three lesser difficulties.</p><p style="">Resistance 3 features the series' first melee-only weapon: a sledgehammer. Originally hinted at during the debut live-action trailer, the sledgehammer is to be at the players disposal during the single player campaign.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><p style="">Newly introduced for Resistance 3 is the mechanic of leveling up weapons. Starting at level one, every weapon through use will eventually rank up two extra levels earning upgrades per level - minus the Sledgehammer and grenades.</p><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1764201-928399_20061019_screen007.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1764201" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.2080078125" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:20.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1764201-928399_20061019_screen007.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1764201"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/1764201-928399_20061019_screen007.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/1764201-928399_20061019_screen007.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style=""><b><a href="/m5a2-carbine/3055-1845/" data-ref-id="3055-1845" data-mce-href="/m5a2-carbine/3055-1845/">M5A2 Folsom Carbine</a></b> - Formerly the standard armament for the US Military, the Carbine is an all round reliable assault rifle, and one that is commonly found with a grenade launcher attachment.</p><ul><li><b>Level 2</b> - A bayonet is attached to the end allowing a more powerful melee attack with the Carbine equipped.</li><li><b>Level 3</b> - The alt-fire grenade launcher will now shoot three grenades at once.</li></ul><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1764320-830px_bullseye_rfom1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1764320" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.40481927710843" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:40.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1764320-830px_bullseye_rfom1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1764320"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/1764320-830px_bullseye_rfom1.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/1764320-830px_bullseye_rfom1.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style=""><b><a href="/bullseye/3055-1855/" data-ref-id="3055-1855" data-mce-href="/bullseye/3055-1855/">The Bullseye</a></b> - The Chimeran's own equivalent to the Carbine, and is fitted with a lot of the standard Chimeran grunts amongst its army.

Many are returning from previous titles, though Resistance 3 introduced a few more different Chimeran varieties.</p><table class="mceItemTable"><thead><tr><th>Returning Chimera</th><th>Newly introduced Chimera</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><u><b>Hybrid</b></u> - The most common of the Chimeran army, Hybrids are mostly humanoid and are the closest to resembling what was once a human-being. Hybrids are all controlled via a Hive-Mind and as such have no emotion, nor ability to reason. They are equipped with a pack on their backs to allow a constant jet of cold so as they can survive on Earth. They are also always fitted with Bullseyes as their weapon of choice.</td><td><b><u>Longlegs</u></b> - Primarily Hybrids but with jet-propelled machinery attached to their legs. Longlegs use their unique abilities for taking huge leaps across the terrain, making them difficult to shoot without a Bullseye tag.</td></tr><tr><td><b><u>Steelhead</u></b> - They are similarly like larger Hybrids, though they are better armoured and instead are always equipped with the surface penetrating Auger weapon.</td><td><b><u>Sniper Hybrid</u></b> - Literally just standard Hybrid units equipped with Deadeye sniper rifles. They also have access to stealth-technology, allowing them to stay hidden from view. Their sniper laser-site is the best way to spot them from afar.</td></tr><tr><td><b><u>Grim</u></b> - Grims are feral Chimera, completely separated from the mindset of the Hive. As such, they are completely mindless; they have no weapons besides their own claws, though they make up for it through sheer number and aggressiveness.</td><td><u><b>Wildfire Hybrid</b></u> - Literally just standard Hybrid units equipped with the Wildfire Rocket Launcher.</td></tr><tr><td><b><u>Leaper</u></b> - Small, insectoid like Chimera, the Leapers scurry aimlessly and, like Grims, are feral and detached from the wishes of the Chimeran Hive-Mind. Also like Grims, Leapers pose a threat mostly through their large numbers, as well as their small size.</td><td><u><b>Sniper Longleg</b></u> - Mixing the best of both worlds, Sniper Longlegs feature all advantages of both Sniper Hybrids and Longlegs, making them an incredibly formidable and dangerous unit to face.</td></tr><tr><td><b><u>Ravager</u></b> - Huge, hulking Chimera, the Ravagers are at the forefront of a Chimeran attack, always equipped with a large weapon to match with their size. In Resistance 3, Ravagers are equipped with Atomizers. They are extremely tough to kill, but as such they encountered fairly sparsely.</td><td><b><u>Leech</u></b> - Leechs are infected Grims, still pulsating with explosive boils from the virus that fuels the Mutator weapon. They charge as soon as they notice the players presence, hoping to get close enough just as they explode. Naturally they are best taken out from a distance.</td></tr><tr><td><b><u>Stalker</u></b> - A four-legged machine, Stalkers are formidable attack drones that are fitted with extremely tough armour, and consistently have a bubble shield to further add to their protection.</td><td><u><b>Widowmaker</b></u> - A huge Chimeran creature, almost resembling an insect, Widowmakers are the largest of the Feral Chimera and are a source of trouble for both humanity and the Hive-Mind Chimera. It's primary attack is to spew a massive stream of acid, covering a wide area. It has many vulnerable spots, though can still be a challenge to take down.</td></tr><tr><td><b><u>Goliath</u></b> - Goliaths are massive, intimidating war-machines resembling a much larger Stalker. They are nigh-indestructible, and are able to completely wipe out Towns and Cities with ease.</td><td><b><u>Brawler</u></b> - Large gorilla-like Chimera, the Brawler can maneuver throughout the environment akin to its primate look-a-likes. It relies on brute force, though has very little armour making it very susceptible to most kinds of gun fire - particularly explosive because of its large size.</td></tr><tr><td><b><u>Dropship</u></b> - Much like the name implies, Dropships are aircraft used to deliver Chimeran troops to the ground. They are still fitted for attacking maneuvers, however, and have access to a heavy machine-gun, rockets and a search light.</td><td><u><b>Satan</b></u> - Another beast of a Chimera, ''Satan'', as it has been dubbed by the local village close-by, has evolved into a kind of large worm through its incubation within the coal mines.</td></tr><tr><td><b><u>Shock Drone</u></b> - Mostly found patrolling Goliaths to spot hostiles within Goliaths blind-spots, Shock Drones are also found on ground level on the hunt to alert dropships as to where to deliver their garrison of Chimera. They can defend themselves with an electric charge, though its damage is minor and the Drones can be shot down rather easily.</td><td><u><b>Shield Drones</b></u> - Similar in appearance to the Shock Drones, the Shield variety has no attacking potential, and merely serves to envelop any specific Chimeran unit with a shield making it indestructible for as long as the shield is up.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>The Wardens</h3><p style="">A group of escaped convicts who have taken over their prison after the Chimeran invasion, The Wardens will be fought against on a couple of occasions. They are originally faced driving in jeeps while Capelli is riding a train to New York City. When on-foot, they fight similarly to Chimeran Hybrids, albeit with more varying weaponry such as Carbines and Rossmore shotguns. Their leader is Michael ''Mick'' Cutter, who may be smarter than he lets on.</p><h2>Beta</h2><p style="">During the month of August, Insomniac opened up a fairly restrictive multiplayer beta for people who pre-ordered <a href="/socom-4-us-navy-seals/3030-30196/" data-ref-id="3030-30196" data-mce-href="/socom-4-us-navy-seals/3030-30196/">SOCOM 4</a>, or bought Blu-ray copies of the action movie <a href="http://www.screened.com/battle-los-angeles/16-196180/" rel="nofollow" data-mce-href="http://www.screened.com/battle-los-angeles/16-196180/"><i>Battle: L.A.</i></a>. It was eventually released for all on August 30th for the final weekend of the beta.</p><p style="">It allowed players to test out two modes-- <a href="/team-deathmatch/3015-2463/" data-ref-id="3015-2463" data-mce-href="/team-deathmatch/3015-2463/">Team Deathmatch</a> and Chain Reaction--across the two maps, <i>Seaside</i>, based in <a href="/wales/3035-1739/" data-ref-id="3035-1739" data-mce-href="/wales/3035-1739/">Wales</a>, and <i>Trainyard</i> in <a href="/colombia/3035-3004/" data-ref-id="3035-3004" data-mce-href="/colombia/3035-3004/">Columbia</a> with a character progression rank cap of 20.</p><p style="">The beta was sized as a 1.5GB download.</p><h2>Multiplayer</h2><p style="">The transitions between Resistance 2 and 3 for their multiplayer is pretty steep, with R2's large 60 player cap now reduced to 16 players. This radical change was stated by the developers to better promote the idea of a smaller scale feel with ordinary folk trying to defend their shanty towns and broken up lands.</p><p style="">Resistance 3 has also taken up some of the most famous traits from <a href="/activision/3010-78/" data-ref-id="3010-78" data-mce-href="/activision/3010-78/">Activision</a>'s own <a href="/call-of-duty/3025-82/" data-ref-id="3025-82" data-mce-href="/call-of-duty/3025-82/">Call of Duty</a> series, with unlockable '' <a href="/perks/3015-366/" data-ref-id="3015-366" data-mce-href="/perks/3015-366/">perks</a>'' to attain, both as action abilities and passive, with race specific abilities also being made for use should the player attain a <a href="/kill-streak/3015-1840/" data-ref-id="3015-1840" data-mce-href="/kill-streak/3015-1840/">kill-streak</a> during match. One example would be a Chimera player unlocking a cloaking shield should the player get three kills without dying. The well-known <i>Prestige</i> system popularised through Call of Duty is in place within the multiplayer as well. Once a player has reached Level 60, they can choose the ''Remnant'' option to revert back to Level 1, with character skins and titles intact (and some extra to show proof of their Remnant status), though all of their weapons and abilities taken away needing to be unlocked again.</p><p style="">To customise your own image whilst playing multiplayer, players can select from a series of character skins for both human and chimera, more being unlocked as they climb the multiplayer ranks. Some character skins, however, are only available via preorder bonuses or by playing in the Global Resistance Facebook game.</p><p style="">Titles are also available to equip; some are unlocked by also going up the ranks, while most require players to perform an all manner of impressive feats within the multiplayer.</p><h3>Modes</h3><ul><li><b>Deathmatch</b> <b>-</b> Standard 16 player every-man-for-himself mode.</li><li><b>Deathmatch Small</b> - Same as the default Deathmatch, though features a small player-count of 8.</li><li><b>Team Deathmatch</b> - 8v8 mode across two teams, one as the human resistance and the other as the chimera.</li><li><b>Wargames</b> - Objective based mode between two teams.</li><li><b>Capture The Flag</b> - Classic mode set between two teams; each with their own flag, the teams are to attempt to capture the enemies flag and bring it back to their own base.</li><li><b>Breach</b> - An Attack &amp; Defend mode.

Based on the anime and manga series <a href="http://www.animevice.com/fist-of-the-north-star/10-32/" rel="nofollow">Fist of the North Star</a>, Fist of the North Star: Ken's Rage is a large-scale brawler in the same vein as <a data-ref-id="3010-94" href="/koei-co-ltd/3010-94/" slug="koei-co-ltd">KOEI's</a> <a data-ref-id="3025-704" href="/musou/3025-704/" slug="musou">Musou</a> series.</p><p style="">Players take control of a number of heroes and villains from the series, fighting through hordes of enemies in either Legend Mode (storylines faithful to the original franchise's story), Dream Mode (original storylines featuring more playable characters), and Challenge Mode (which pits players against a continuous stream of opponents).</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">Fist of the North Star: Ken's Rage is a beat'em up that pits the player character against hordes of enemies.</p><p style="">Every character has a health gauge, a spirit gauge and a focus gauge. The health bar is shown as a green bar and if that bar is empty, it'll be game over.</p><h3><u>Basic Attacks</u></h3><p style="">There are two buttons for attacking, normal attack and strong attack. The normal attack is used to create a chain of combos whilst the Strong Attack is used to follow up on a normal attack. So this can be experimented on by doing (Normal, Strong) (Normal, Normal, Strong) and by doing so, different types of attacks can be made. If timed, it’s possible to also link the combos together. For example, Kenshiro can do (Normal, Strong) which acts as a launcher, this can then be followed up with another combo; it's just like juggling an opponent in a fighting game.</p><p style="">Each character can throw and there are three types of throwing. Normal Throw, Strong Throw or Running Throw (some characters can perform this one). The Running Throw is prefect for crowd control.</p><p style="">Taunting is good as a mechanic (and not just to mock the thugs) as upon using it, any surrounding lower thugs would jump in a circle in front of the character ready to attack but also making it super-useful to use combos or Signature Moves. However using it a lot would make some enemies much strong shown as yellow sparks.</p><h3><u>Meridian Shock</u></h3><p style="">Meridian Shock is a good way to stun the opponents which is shown as electrical charges surrounding them. Once they're in that state, their defense is lowered causing additional attacks to be stronger. Also it's a good way to stop them in their tracks and throw them. Different upgrades can perform status ailments once in Meridian Shock like for example Poison which drains the opponent's life. The more consecutive attacks are performed, the more likely they will be shocked. Some combos like using any of the Nanto guys will be shocked once entering their own special mode. For the ranged fighters like Mamiya or Jagi, their weapons can also shock them.</p><p style="">There is a kill counter shown at the bottom left hand corner of the screen and it only shows up once the kill has been made.</p><h3><u>The Gauges</u></h3><h3>Health Gauge</h3><p style="">This is the player's health bar. As the player's health drops health from being attacked, the players clothes are torn off. It can be recovered by picking up health items.</p><h3>Spirit Gauge</h3><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/137417/2300787-2300786-2012_7_16_19_37_51.m2ts___00000.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2300787" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0" style="width: 1px"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/137417/2300787-2300786-2012_7_16_19_37_51.m2ts___00000.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2300787"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/137417/2300787-2300786-2012_7_16_19_37_51.m2ts___00000.jpg"></a><figcaption>Spirit Gauge</figcaption></figure><p style="">The Spirit gauge gets filled as enemies get beaten shown as a orange/yellow bar. Once filled, it adds 1 bar meaning that a Signature Move can be used. Items can also be used to boost this gauge.</p><p style="">Signature Moves can use between 1-3 bars depending on which move is being used. It is also best to use these if the character is in danger as it also grants invincibility as no opponent can touch the character. Up to four Signature Moves can be equipped via the D-Pad to quickly switch moves. Signature Moves can be bought by paying for them with Skill Points.</p><h3>Focus Gauge</h3><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/137417/2299238-musou_gauge.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2299238" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.4513274336283" data-width="113" style="width: 113px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:145.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/137417/2299238-musou_gauge.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2299238"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/137417/2299238-musou_gauge.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/137417/2299238-musou_gauge.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Focus Gauge</figcaption></figure><p style="">The Focus Gauge shown on the left of the gauges in the form of a semi-circle also gets filled up like the Spirit Gauge but it is used differently. However, that gauge can also be dropped if attacked repeatedly like when enemy performs a signature move on the character and if burned by a flamethrower. It can be filled up to three bars and can be quickly built up by: smacking thugs into walls or objects getting a "Smash Bonus" and receiving bonuses for certain missions.</p><p style="">The <b>Spirit Aura</b> uses the Focus Gauge once it is activated. An aura will shine on the character and if there are any enemies surrounding that character, they will be temporarily stunned. Upon activation, it grants a boost of strength as well as different versions of the moves itself. Once activated, it consumes any bars left and it is converted into time so the more bars are filled the more time can be added in this mode.</p><p style="">The Hyper Signature move can only be used during activation of the Spirit Aura, it grants access to some extra Signature Moves, designed to instantly kill the opponent(s). The more bars are filled, the more wider the attack can be i.e. Level 1 is used to attack 1 opponent, whilst Level 2 and 3 reaches out as an Area of Attack.</p><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/137417/2299909-2299908-2011_1_31_21_35_32.m2ts___00000.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2299909" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.55056179775281" data-width="178" style="width: 178px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:55.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/137417/2299909-2299908-2011_1_31_21_35_32.m2ts___00000.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2299909"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/137417/2299909-2299908-2011_1_31_21_35_32.m2ts___00000.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/137417/2299909-2299908-2011_1_31_21_35_32.m2ts___00000.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Karma Points Gauge</figcaption></figure><p style="">Upon defeating enemies (or objects), karma points shown as blue orbs are automatically collected which is the equivalent of experience points. The default is 150 and after reaching 150, the character receives skill points which are used to spend on points in the Meridian Chart. Some upgrades can be used to use to their advantage as upon leveling up, attributes can be increased in game either on health, defense or power.</p><h3>Battle Results</h3><p style="">Once a stage is complete a battle results page shows up on the screen displaying stats after completing a stage and shows a grade for how good the player completed the level. It shows the following:</p><h3>Skill points obtained</h3><p style="">By performing well in the stages, additional skill points are obtainable by completing bonuses</p><ul><li>Battle - This is the total number of skill points obtained in the stage.</li><li>Scenario Bonus - Bonus skill points are given for leveling up the character or finding bottles that level the player up.</li><li>Critical Hit Bonus - If the correct signature move hits the boss, the player gets an additional 35 skill points.</li><li>Harbinger of Death Bonus - If all the scenario stages are complete, this bonus is rewarded which is worth 45 points.</li></ul><h3>Overall Rating</h3><p style="">This section grades the player based on how well they did on each section.</p><ul><li>Mission Bonus - As represented by the 7 stars, this shows how many missions have been completed.</li><li>Damage Taken - Makes a record on how damaged the play got during the stage (Collecting health items does not affect the grade).</li><li>Kill Count - This shows how many enemies the player has killed and the kill counter is always shown during the game.</li><li>Signature Move Kills - Shows how many times a signature move has been performed in the game.</li></ul><h2>Characters</h2><p style="">The following characters are playable in the game:</p><h3>Hokuto Type</h3><table class="t-editor

mode. They are:</p><h2>Legend Mode</h2><p style="">In Legend Mode, the player fights through storylines based on events from the first story arc of the manga. At first, only <a data-ref-id="3005-7319" href="/kenshiro/3005-7319/" slug="kenshiro">Kenshiro</a> is available, but as the player progresses, more characters become unlocked for play.</p><p style="">Bosses in Legend Mode have their own unique stages set for them. The camera also changes so that it looks at where the boss is located. Boss character's are different with normal enemies as their gauge is a the bottom of the screen and are segmented into sections, depending on the boss, once a section is depleted, the boss would automatically push the character back and would either go into their aura, call out enemies or in some cases, both.</p><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/137417/2299907-harbinger_of_death.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2299907" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/137417/2299907-harbinger_of_death.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2299907"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/137417/2299907-harbinger_of_death.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/137417/2299907-harbinger_of_death.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Harbinger of Death: Now try doing this another 7 more times!</figcaption></figure><p style="">Once the boss's health is completely drained, a finisher can be performed. This consists of pressing a combination of button prompts on the screen on a time limit. Once succeeded, the Signature move is performed and the boss is defeated.

Unlike its sprite-based predecessors, the new game features 3D character models in both exploration and battle. <br/>  <br/>Some systems return from the earlier games. In Dive sequences, you enter a heroine's psyche, or "Cosmosphere", and undertake visual-novel adventures to gain her trust. You can craft items from recipes found in dungeons. In combat, three vanguard characters fight, while a Reyvateil character performs song magic.<br/> <br/>Several new systems were created for At3. With the Purge mechanic, a Reyvateil in battle can progressively disintegrate her costume in order to expose more of her skin to the stars which give her power. The less she is wearing, the more powerful her magic. The battles are now real-time and 3D. In the Cosmosphere, you can collect Hymmnes, which are bits of song magic that you program into a Reyvateil. Each one has an effect on her magic and can dynamically affect the music that plays during battle.]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>29051</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/2154866-box_artq.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/2154866-box_artq.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/2154866-box_artq.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/2154866-box_artq.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/2154866-box_artq.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2154866-box_artq.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/2154866-box_artq.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Ar tonelico Qoga: Knell of Ar Ciel]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>1</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-27/]]></api_detail_url><id>27</id><name><![CDATA[CERO: C]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-16/]]></api_detail_url><id>16</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: M]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-36/]]></api_detail_url><id>36</id><name><![CDATA[PEGI: 12+]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-38/]]></api_detail_url><id>38</id><name><![CDATA[OFLC: PG]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2011-03-15 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/ar-tonelico-qoga-knell-of-ar-ciel/3030-29051/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-29063/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2009-10-17 13:13:34</date_added><date_last_updated>2011-09-11 18:03:14</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[The ninth game in the Buzz! series of trivia quiz games.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview <br/></h2>"Buzz!: Quiz World" is the ninth release in the <a data-ref-id="3025-79" href="/buzz/3025-79/" slug="buzz">    Buzz! franchise</a>. The game released for the PS3 in Europe on Oct. 30, 2009 and in North America on Nov. 10, 2009. The game also was released for the PSP in Europe on Dec. 18, 2009. Both the PS3 and PSP versions of the game support DLC and the PS3 version supports DLC from previous games along with user-submitted questions.  <br/> <br/><h2>Question Types <br/></h2><h3>Point Builder  </h3>Basic trivia where you get points for getting questions right. <br/> <br/><h3>Fastest Finger</h3>The person who gets the question right in the fastest time gets the points. <br/> <br/><h3>Stop The Clock</h3>Similar to Fastest Finger, but everyone who gets the question right gets points based on the speed in which they buzzed in. <br/> <br/><h3>Pie Fight  </h3>Questions slowly appear one letter at a time. The person who gets the question correct gets the pie. After the question, the person with the pie has a chance to hit someone (including themselves). Each person can get hit by a pie twice before losing. Last one standing wins. <br/> <br/><h3>On The Spot</h3>A random person is selected to answer a challenging question where the other players must vote on the how likely it is that the person will get the question right. The less likely votes are worth more, where as the very likely votes are worth less. The points are then either given or taken from the person depending on the outcome. <br/> <br/><h3>Short Fuse</h3>Essentially this is a trivia version of Hot Potato. Someone gets the bomb and can toss it to someone else once they answer correct. For every incorrect answer they hold on to the bomb and have to answer more questions. If the bomb goes off while you are holding it you will lose 300 points. <br/> <br/><h3>Over The Edge</h3>The goal of this mode is to be the last person standing. Each person starts off at base level in front of a pool of green slime. When someone gets an answer correct, they stay at the level they are at while every other player rises one level. If someone gives an incorrect answer, they will move up one level while everyone else stays at the same level they were at. Once you get to the 5th level, you will fall into the pool and be eliminated. Just like in Pie Fight, the questions appear one letter at a time. <br/> <br/><h3>Boiling Point</h3>Each player has a thermometer behind them where when they answer a question correctly, it raises one level. The first player to get it to the top wins. <br/> <br/><h3>Point Stealer</h3>In this mode the first person to get each question right chooses who they want to steal 300 points from. <br/> <br/><h3>High Stakes</h3>This is similar to Final Jeopardy in the game show Jeopardy where contestants are given a theme on what the question will be and then have to wager points on their outcome. If they get the question right, they win the points wagered, if they get it wrong, they lose them. <br/> <br/><h3>The Final Countdown</h3>The final round of the game has each player's podium raised a certain height depending on how many points they got throughout the game. When a question is asked the podiums start lowering, and stop when you answer the question. The first player to get the question correct gets a small boost to their podium height. Any other correct answers just has the podium stay where it is. If a player gets a question wrong, their podium will drop a bit. Once a player's podium touches the ground they are eliminated. Last one standing wins.<h2>Online </h2>Online games feature up to 8 participants, with a maximum of four per user. Online matches feature the same 5 game modes; Point Builder, Boiling Point, High Stakes, Stop The Clock, and ending with Final Countdown.]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>29063</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/1887880-box_buzzqw.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/1887880-box_buzzqw.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/1887880-box_buzzqw.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/1887880-box_buzzqw.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/1887880-box_buzzqw.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1887880-box_buzzqw.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/1887880-box_buzzqw.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Buzz!

Taking place in the future, the story follows Davis Russel, a hotheaded young cop who witnesses the invasion of his planet by an unforeseen enemy called the Lutadores. Davis Russel must fight through mysterious anomalies and the invasion in order to find Davis’ missing child.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1864455-gravitasdebug_2011_08_03_16_41_00_09.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1864455" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1864455-gravitasdebug_2011_08_03_16_41_00_09.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1864455"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1864455-gravitasdebug_2011_08_03_16_41_00_09.jpg"></a></figure><p style="">Inversion plays very much like a traditional third person cover based shooter. The main draw to Inversion's gameplay comes from the player's ability to manipulate gravity. Players can use the arm mounted Gravlink gun to use bursts of either low or high gravity.</p><p style="">Low gravity in combat situations allows the player to either pull enemies out from cover or use objects in the environment as weapons. Out of combat however, it can be used to solve basic environmental puzzles and clear paths. High gravity in combat can be used to force enemies to their knees and root them to a spot. The player can also make use of high gravity to pull down objects and form cover.</p><p style="">Most of the ablities that player gets from the gravlink are used in much the same way by the enemies. For instance, enemies can use the gravlink gun to pull the player out of cover, causing them to float exposed above ground.</p><p style="">The environment in Inversion is filled with gravity anomalies that shift gravity while the player is traversing through an area. The game is filled with zero gravity sections and places where floors and ceilings are flipped.</p><p style="">Inversion allows the use of both human and alien based weaponry. Most of the weapons seen in the game are slight variations of common weapons seen in most modern shooters such as:</p><ul><li>Assualt Rifles</li><li>Shotguns</li><li>Sniper Rifles</li><li>Grenades</li><li>Rocket Launcher</li><li>Minigun</li><li>Flamethrower</li></ul><p style="">The campaign can also be played in its entirety in two player co-operative mode. Leo Delgado functions as the player's AI buddy when playing the single player mode.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p style="">Inversion begins with Davis Russel's opening monologue:</p><blockquote><p style="">Can't even remember as things were before. Before war was even an idea, before they came, destroyed everything we had</p><p style="">and took our children as their own and made us slaves.</p></blockquote><p style="">The game formally begins with Davis Russel and his partner Leo Delgado, who are traditional police officers in Vanguard City. The city is presented as a fictional place in near future Earth. It's Davis' daughter Leila's birthday so he decides to visit home on his break. On the way over to Davis' apartment they witness numerous explosions and people running for their lives from a large muscular man with a gun. Being cops, they decide to stop and investigate. Davis and Leo take on the assailants and manage to clear the road. At this point, Leo encounters the first gravity anomaly when he sees a milk carton floating above ground. Seeing as such technology has never been seen before, Leo begins to fear that they are being invaded by people from another planet.</p><p style="">All around them Earth seems to be shifting. Gravity is acting in unusual ways, buildings collapse and chunks of rubble float in mid air. Davis realizes that this "invasion" might be happening all across the city and they decide to immediately make their to his apartment. Davis finds his wife Carolina dead and fearing the worst begins calling out for Leila. The apartment building is falling apart and Leila is nowhere to be seen. They are eventually overwhelmed by the invading forces and are taken captive.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1864458-gravitasdebug_2011_08_03_17_18_51_30.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1864458" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1864458-gravitasdebug_2011_08_03_17_18_51_30.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1864458"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1864458-gravitasdebug_2011_08_03_17_18_51_30.jpg"></a></figure><p style="">They are taken to a makeshift prison camp outside of the city where several of the humans are being held captive. Davis notices that the invaders speak an incomprehensible form of broken English. Much to his regret, Davis does not see any children being held in the camp. During their imprisonment they learn that humans are being used as slave labor to dig an enormous hole in the ground by these "Lutadores". After 35 days of being treated as slaves, they meet Fitzgerald, their new cell mate. Fitzgerald claims to have been fighting alongside his now dead brother when he was captured. He says he was with a gang of fighters going after the Lutadores leader, Kiltehr before they were ambushed. When asked by Davis if he had seen Leila, Fitzgerald claims to have seen not a single child in the city suggesting that the Lutadores might have taken them somewhere else.</p><p style="">A few days later, the Lutadores take Davis and Leo to the hole in the ground through a series of underground tunnels. This is where the Lutadores willingly give the Gravlink tool to Davis and Leo and point them towards another path in the tunnels. Moving forward unsupervised in the tunnels, they see mass graves of dumped bodies but once again no children. Further in, they see a flying robot burst out of the ground and attack the Lutadores. Davis realizes that they have been presumably sent underground to deal with the robot. Taking down the robot leaves Davis injured and bleeding.</p><p style="">Back at the cell, Fitzgerald states that the wounded and sick don't last long in the camp and that they should make their escape as soon as possible. Fitzgerald provides Leo with a lockpick and assures him of creating a diversion for their escape. Davis and Leo sneak out of the prison and into the camp but are forced to leave Fitzgerald behind. Their stealthy escape does not last long however when they are attacked by a Lutadore Captain and his squad. After barely fighting off the Lutadores, Davis passes out due to his injury. Leo manages to patch up Davis and also find Gravlink tools left behind by the Lutadores. Their only way of escape out of the camp seems to be through the tunnels underground. Once inside the tunnels, they decide to go through the hole created by the flying robot in their earlier encounter. Upon exiting the camp they are immediately attacked by surprised Lutadores. The Lutadores use a huge drill machines (Terraformer) to dig their way onto the surface and thus create pathways for their allies.</p><p style="">After escaping the assault, Davis insists on searching for his daughter and Leo begrudgingly follows along. They reach the apartment but Leila is again nowhere to be found. Davis is distraught with grief and Leo assures him that they will do whatever it takes to find his daughter. Leaving the apartment building they see a group of humans fighting off the Lutadores. After helping out the human fighters, Davis is introduced to Banks, the leader of the squad he calls the "Free People". Banks says they are gathering humans all around and fighting back. When Davis asks him about Leila, Banks suggests that she might have been taken to Camp T'Kal. They mutually agree to help each other to get to Camp T'Kal.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1864461-gravitasdebug_2011_08_03_17_33_10_34.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1864461" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1864461-gravitasdebug_2011_08_03_17_33_10_34.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1864461"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1864461-gravitasdebug_2011_08_03_17_33_10_34.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1864461-gravitasdebug_2011_08_03_17_33_10_34.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Banks asks Davis and Leo to infiltrate a nearby Lutadore base and find any information pertaining to the location of Camp T'Kal. Davis and Leo fight their way through and come across the leader of the base called "The Butcher". After defeating the butcher they question him about the location of the children. The butcher mumbles something about a Prophet and says that the children are at the eastern edge of the city. Davis radios Banks with the information but gets no response. Upon leaving the base they see that Banks' squad has been pinned down by Lutadore mortar fire. On the way towards Banks' positon, Davis meets up with Fitzgerald again, who claims to have escaped in the confusion after he helped them escape the prison camp. Banks orders Davis and Leo to take out the mortar while the rest of the squad finds a functioning APC for transport. Later, Davis and Leo are then tasked with escorting the APC safely out of the city towards Camp T'Kal.</p><p style="">On the way over to the east side, the squad tries to makes sense of how the Lutadores are capable of manipulating gravity. None of them seem convinced at how such "barbarians" could've managed to figure out gravity manipulation. One of them suggests they might be from another Planet where gravity anomalies are a norm. Banks immediately squashes their discussion however, stating that none of them are intellectuals and that they should stop wasting time theorizing. He states their only job should be to drive the invaders back to wherever they came from. When asked by Leo to weigh in on the situation, Davis quickly reaffirms to care only about his daughter. The APC gets constant mortar barrages when they are closer to Camp T'Kal and are forced to stop.</p><p style="">Banks orders Fitzgerald to protect the APC while rest of the squad moves up through the Lutadores defenses. After clearing out their defenses, Banks suggests that the squad should split up. Banks, Davis and Leo head up into the camp to see if they can find any info on Leila. While the rest of the squad holds the position and tries to repair the damaged APC. The three of them now make their across a chasms and cliffs towards Camp T'Kal. Davis gets separated from the group as the land around them shifts and they decide to meet up later. You meet at the end, where Banks comments that Camp T'Kal might the command and control for the whole show. He claims taking this camp out would potentially stop the entire Lutadore invasion. They notice some noise in the vicinity and discover it's a young boy named Peter who's being hiding out. Davis asks the boy if he has seen Leila. But Peter says there are hundreds of children in the camp and that he can't really be sure. Peter says the Lutadores were going to take all the children to a place called "station". Davis being emotionally distressed aggressively questions the boy to point out the location of the station. Peter points to a massive floating mass of objects out in the distance and claims the Lutadores take all the children down into a hole in the earth. At this point Davis and Leo part ways with Banks. Banks takes Peter with him back to the APC and wishes Davis luck in finding Leila.</p><p style="">Davis and Leo now have to make their way into Camp T'Kal to get over to the "station". Once they are inside the camp, one of the human prisoners (visibly insane from being imprisoned) informs them that the Lutadores have the humans collared and whipped. He says that they have killed most of the prisoners who do not obey their masters and act like slaves. Moving further into the camp, they see several dead humans hanging from ceilings. They eventually reach the room where the children were being held and find it deserted. Leo comments that they are probably taking children because they can't have their own. They walk across rows of prison cells, where seemingly indoctrinated humans are being held. These "humans" have collars on their necks and appear to have no memory of their past lives. As Davis and Leo move past these cells, the indoctrinated humans begin to speak in a monotone voice.</p><blockquote><p style="">Reject your sinful nature, submit to the will of the rightful Master and join us. The hand of the master cures the pain, it gives you liberation...The Master can save you...save you from your sufferings.</p></blockquote><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1864459-gravitasdebug_2011_08_03_17_23_36_67.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1864459" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1864459-gravitasdebug_2011_08_03_17_23_36_67.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1864459"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1864459-gravitasdebug_2011_08_03_17_23_36_67.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1864459-gravitasdebug_2011_08_03_17_23_36_67.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Making past the rows of cells, they enter an enclosed arena. They meet the Slave Driver who pits his indoctrinated slaves against Davis and Leo. After defeating the slave driver Davis manages to scavenge a High Gravity module off his dead body, which allows him to upgrade the Gravlink gun. They make their way out of the camp and are attacked by a much larger force of Lutadores. They are forced into using a Terraformer to literally dig a hole and escape the onslaught. The terraformer digs its way into the gravity well which Peter mentioned was the station. Making their way across the zero gravity chasm, Leo remarks at its enormous size and is amazed at how the Lutadores could have managed to dig such a deep hole. Leo presumes that it would take years to dig so much and that they couldn't have accomplished such a task on their own.</p><p style="">After making their way across the chasm, they now have to find a way to get down towards the hole in the ground that Peter claims is the station. As they are traversing through the varying gravity fields they find large metallic cells lined on the floors. Davis suggests that this might be the source of the power that's controlling gravity. He thinks Lutadores are digging holes to put these cells into the ground and then control gravity. He thinks they can stop the Lutadores if they find where these cells are being made.</p><p style="">They fight their way across several hordes of Lutadores and eventually get to a series of high tech metallic tunnels like nothing they have seen before. They are greeted by a computer voice that warns them of contamination and activates defenses to protect the "core". At this point, Davis and Leo are unsure about what exactly is going on. On exiting the tunnels, they realize that the "station" is a technologically advanced underground railway station used for transport. They see the indoctrinated humans being used as slave labor on the station's loading platform. Once again Davis and Leo are amazed that the Lutadores could construct such an enormous station and keep it hidden deep underground.</p><p style="">They overhear the Lutadores talking about transporting slaves in the train and decide that Leila might have been taken along with them in the train. Following the train takes them to an area the computer refers to as "Zone 143". Getting off the train they notice, all of the Lutadores guarding the station are dead. Leo thinks they might have been attacked by the flying robots and Davis agrees speculating that the robots are essentially guarding the place.</p><p style="">They fight both Lutadores and the flying robots to once again make their way through tunnels to get to the surface of Zone 143. Flying through the zero gravity zones they notice that the entire place is repairing itself. Leo comments on how he has never seen this sort of technology before. Davis still doesn't seem to understand why the Lutadores and the robots are fighting each other. It is at this point made clear that humans are just part of some larger war between the Lutadores and the robots. Davis and Leo enter a large domed area which seems to be presented as a viewing chamber. Davis opens the shutters to bring in some light and they see a series of gigantic domes covering cities. At this point they come to the realization that the city of Vanguard is under a huge dome floating in Space while being connected to an enormous spaceship.</p><p style="">They realize that they have been lied to their entire lives. Leo begins to question their entire existence. In an effort to calm Leo, Davis tells him that they should just focus on finding his daughter and deal with this larger issue later. At which point Leo vehemently claims that Leila isn't out there and that this is just a waste of time. They eventually reconcile and arrive at the conclusion that the train acts as transport between the domes on the spaceship. They decide to keep moving forward and look for Leila. Upon exiting the train station, they reach the surface and enter what seems to be the "Lutadore Dome". Davis sees the children being escorted by the Lutadores out of the station.</p><p style="">They fight their way across the Lutadore territory and overhear that the children are being transported on barges to the capital. After getting hold of a transport barge they follow the children deeper towards the Lutadore city. They keep following the slave transport always being one step behind. Navigating through zero gravity environments, they notice that much of the Lutadore city has very similar structures to a human city. Davis concludes that the domes must have been built by the same person and were probably identical replicas at one point in the past. Leo then begins to question whether the Lutadores were human before all this started.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1864457-gravitasdebug_2011_08_03_16_48_00_00.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1864457" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1864457-gravitasdebug_2011_08_03_16_48_00_00.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1864457"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1864457-gravitasdebug_2011_08_03_16_48_00_00.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1864457-gravitasdebug_2011_08_03_16_48_00_00.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Inside the Lutadore citadel they find rows of cages with children. Davis begins to search for Leila among the children and realizes that she's not there. Just as Davis begins to loose hope he hears a voice calling out for help. Running around the corner to check, he gets ambushed and knocked out by the Lutadores. Upon regaining consciousness Davis and Leo realize they are strung up as sacrifice in a large area surrounded by angry Lutadores, while their leader Kiltehr gives a somewhat incomprehensible speech. Kiltehr claims that the humans should be sacrifice for the "lords" that built the dome. He wants the "lords" to take this offering and rid the Lutadores of their suffering. The sacrifice is timely interrupted when Banks and his squad burst into the city center. Kiltehr surprised by the large force of humans decides to make his escape. The squad unties Davis and Leo and Banks orders them to deal with Kiltehr while the rest of the squad handles the Lutadores.</p><p style="">Davis and Leo purse Kiltehr through more tech chambers and tunnels, fighting the Lutadores and flying robots on their way. Kiltehr begins to claim that he is the supreme being and that he should have control over Inversion. Their pursuit eventually leads them to an area the computer refers to as the Inversion Energy Distribution center. They enter a larger circular dome shaped room, in the center of which is a comparatively small pulsating ball of energy. Davis suggests that this might be the engine room of the spaceship. After being backed into a corner by David and Leo, Kiltehr sets the Inversion worldship to self-destruct, deciding that if he's going down, he's going to take every single habitat dome down with him.</p><p style="">Davis and Leo manage to take down Kiltehr before he could fully shutdown the Energy Distribution center. However, at the very last second Kiltehr drags Davis down with him into the pit below the energy bubble. As Davis falls to his death, Leo manages to use the override key just in time to avert shutdown and restore inversion. The computer then states that the former route has been reactivated with an estimated arrival 8273hrs.</p><p style="">With Kiltehr dead, the Lutadores all throw down their weapons and give up. Those of the humans that survived are set free to return to what remains of their former lives.</p><p style="">The game ends with Leo's monologue.</p><blockquote><p style="">Their victory was hollow, they had lost their wives and children, lies that they had been living for years had been exposed.</p><p style="">The ship was saved, but with no idea as to where it was headed. But for now, the surviving members were safe inside their</p><p style="">domes.</p></blockquote><p style="">Leo reveals at the very end that he had found Leila dead while they were searching for her in Davis' apartment, but couldn't bring himself to tell Davis. In a sequence after the credits, an arm is shown climbing out of the pit in the engine room, indicating that Davis is still alive.</p><h2><ins></ins>Story Missions</h2><p style="">Prologue: Inversion</p><p style="">Chapter 01: Vanguard Down</p><p style="">Chapter 02: Caged</p><p style="">Chapter 03: Breakout</p><p style="">Chapter 04: Road Home</p><p style="">Chapter 05: Street Fight</p><p style="">Chapter 06: Road to Hell</p><p style="">Chapter 07: Edge of the World</p><p style="">Chapter 08: Into the Depths</p><p style="">Chapter 09: Enlightenment</p><p style="">Chapter 10: Reveal</p><p style="">Chapter 11: Red Sky</p><p style="">Chapter 12: Deja Vanguard</p><p style="">Chapter 13: Reversion</p><h2>Multiplayer</h2><p style="">Inversion features a variety of multiplayer modes such as</p><ul><li>Deathmatch</li><li>Team Deathmatch</li><li>Hourglass - A variation on the popular King of the Hill mode.

It was released for the <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC </a>on January 18, 2011, with a later date scheduled for the <a href="/playstation-3/3045-35/" data-ref-id="3045-35">PS3</a>. Players take the role of a Planeswalker and will have access to all five color decks. They can then take their decks and duel each other or participate in the single player campaign.</p><p style=""> </p><p style="">Players start with access to the first chapter of the PvE campaign, but need to spend real money (via stationcash) to purchase additional chapters. The starting deck depends on what color you select when you create your avatar and consists of 40 cards, the minimum required to create a playing deck. Additional cards are gained by completing mission in the PvE campaign, or by spending cash to buy boosters.</p><p style=""> </p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style=""> </p><p style="">The gameplay in Tactics deviates markedly from the original card game. The playing field is divided into grids, creatures move around on the playing field, can only melee attack adjacent enemies, need line of sight to use ranged attack or special abilities etc. Large creatures can occupy more than 1 grid. Each creature has, in addition to the usual attack/defence stats, the following 3 stats that are used for the new system:</p><ul><li>Movement: How many spaces the creature may move. Flying creatures may fly over obstacles, but not end their turn on them. There are also spectral creatures that may move through obstacles.</li><li>Initiative: How often the creature gets a turn. In normal MtG player 1 and all his creatures take a turn, then player 2 etc. In Tactics every creature (including the player's avatar) is kept track of individually, and the higher their initiative, the more often they act.</li><li>Range: The number of spaces the creature can attack. Enemies that are far away take less damage.</li></ul><h2>System Requirements</h2><h3>Minimum</h3><ul><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows XP</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Pentium 4 3.0 GHz, AMD Athlon FX-53</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 1 GB</li><li><strong>Hard Disk Space:</strong> 2.16 GB Free Space</li><li><strong>Video Card:</strong> NVIDIA GeForce 8600 or ATI Radeon HD2900</li><li><strong>Additional:</strong> Broadband Internet Connection</li></ul><h3>Recommended</h3><ul><li><strong>OS: </strong>Windows XP, Vista, 7</li><li><strong>Processor: </strong>Intel Core2 Duo or AMD Athlon FX-60</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2 GB</li><li><strong>Hard Disk Space:</strong> 2.16 GB Free Space</li><li><strong>Video Card:</strong> NVIDIA GeForce 8800 or ATI Radeon HD2900</li></ul>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>29147</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/0/573/1184600-magic_tactics.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/573/1184600-magic_tactics.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/0/573/1184600-magic_tactics.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/573/1184600-magic_tactics.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/573/1184600-magic_tactics.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/573/1184600-magic_tactics.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/0/573/1184600-magic_tactics.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Magic: The Gathering - Tactics]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating/><original_release_date>2011-01-18 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/magic-the-gathering-tactics/3030-29147/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-29171/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2009-11-05 10:44:34</date_added><date_last_updated>2014-10-16 12:49:02</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[EA Sports' college basketball title with former Oklahoma forward Blake Griffin as the cover athlete.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<p style="">The latest and last college basketball video game, released in 2009.</p><h2>Improvements</h2><ul><li>ESPN and CBS Sports announcers and broadcasts, including big name hosts such as Brad Nessler and Dick Vitale.</li><li>Weekly RPI and roster updates into the game (discontinued)</li><li>General engine, mechanics, and movement upgrades</li><li>Game tempo options (Up Tempo, Balanced, and Half Court) to match your team's play style.</li></ul><h2>Discontinuation</h2><p style="">Despite retaining the license, EA Sports announced in 2010 that they would not continue the franchise, and that NCAA Basketball 10 would likely be the last entry in the series.

Deadliest Catch television series. Immediately upon receiving rights they announced Deadliest Catch: Sea of Chaos which is their video game take on the series. The game will include the different characters on the show as well as their likenesses.  <br/>Further in the game's development it was found that it would support motion controls, The PlayStation Move and the Wii were announced the use the controls, but Microsoft's Kinect was never announced for the new controls. It is presumed that the PlayStation Move and the Wii will control identically. This is the second Game that Captain <a data-ref-id="3005-17164" href="/sig-hansen/3005-17164/" slug="sig-hansen"> Sig Hansen</a> has created about the series, he created one for Xbox in August of 2008 that was some what along the same lines.

They begin on a trip to gather a large haul of crab, but there are other crab fisherman wanting the same. The group will have to compete with various captains and crews of the crab boats. This is basically the same storyline as the show on TV and fans of the show should expect to see some of the same things that were shown in the show.  <br/><br/> <br/> <h2>Gameplay </h2> <figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/68180/1629641-untitled_3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1629641" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.56270627062706" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/68180/1629641-untitled_3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1629641"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/68180/1629641-untitled_3.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/68180/1629641-untitled_3.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>One of the various mini games</figcaption></figure>In Sea of Chaos, the player will choose a crab boat and crew to use throughout the game. Different boats will have different statistics, An example would be a fast boat that isn't able to hold a lot of crab. Players should be prepared to (like and other strategy game) make trade offs and tough decisions. The player uses strategy in making  their decision. After choosing a crew, the game places you in the Bering Sea to catch as many Opilio and King Crab as possible. Crab are caught by strategically moving your boat through the sea and choosing places to drop nets. Success on catching crab depends on finding a correct spot on the map to to drop the nets. When you bring in a haul of crab there are mini games for many of the chores and exciting moments found on a crab boat. Mini games may include sorting fish, ship repairs, breaking ice off of the boat, and rescuing those who fall overboard. There are different modes separate from the main mode and those include season modes online multiplayer. <br/> <br/><h2>Characters<br/></h2>In the same interview at E3 Sig Mentioned that Because of the game being mainly for the fans of the show all of the fan favorites were necessary in the game so be prepared to see the captains and deckhands from the show.]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>29188</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/6/63119/1500877-a1c0_iir0tl._aa1500_.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/63119/1500877-a1c0_iir0tl._aa1500_.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/6/63119/1500877-a1c0_iir0tl._aa1500_.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/63119/1500877-a1c0_iir0tl._aa1500_.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/6/63119/1500877-a1c0_iir0tl._aa1500_.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/63119/1500877-a1c0_iir0tl._aa1500_.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/6/63119/1500877-a1c0_iir0tl._aa1500_.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Deadliest

Players control Francis York Morgan (or other characters in certain chapters) as they navigate around town, searching for clues. Moving the left stick controls the player's movement while moving the right stick controls the camera. (In rare occasions, the camera is fixed in a particular location) Holding down the X button causes York to move faster (slowly filling up his Pulse Gauge in the process). Holding down the X button and pressing down on the left stick causes York to perform a quick 180-degree turn. Holding down the left or right bumpers cause York to strafe left or right. Pressing the Y button toggles York's flashlight (though he doesn't seem to be physically carrying any flashlights).</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Certain objects and items can be interacted with (using the A button) or observed (using the B button). Observing objects often gives a text dialog indicating what it does (though sometimes it's necessary to proceed through the game). Interacting allows York to pick up items (if he has enough space in his inventory), go through doors (which can be opened faster by running while interacting), push boxes and use objects. Items can also be automatically placed into York's Toolbox by pressing the Y button.</p><h3>Hunger, Fatigue, and Hygiene</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Deadly Premonition utilizes <a href="/hunger/3015-677/" data-ref-id="3015-677">hunger</a> management and <a href="/fatigue/3015-5975/" data-ref-id="3015-5975">fatigue</a> management systems. Along with Health and Pulse gauges, York also has a Hunger Gauge and a Sleep Gauge, which both slowly depletes over time. If the Sleep Gauge is fully depleted, the Hunger Gauge depletes quicker. If the Hunger Gauge is fully depleted, the Health Gauge starts depleting. Eating food items such as <a href="/lollipop/3055-639/" data-ref-id="3055-639">lollipops</a> and cans of <a href="/pickle/3055-3527/" data-ref-id="3055-3527">pickles</a> restores some of the Hunger Gauge, as well as eating at certain establishments in Greenvale. Drinking <a href="/coffee/3055-2716/" data-ref-id="3055-2716">coffee</a> or <a href="/root-beer/3055-721/" data-ref-id="3055-721">root beer</a> restores some of the Sleep Gauge, as well as <a href="/sleeping/3015-1538/" data-ref-id="3015-1538">sleeping</a> in beds. (which also restores the Health Gauge and advances the time)</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Along from managing hunger and tiredness, the game also has a hygiene management system. Hygiene isn't indicated by a gauge or a meter. Instead, it's indicated on York's character model. Opting not to <a href="/shaving/3015-4750/" data-ref-id="3015-4750">shave</a> results in York growing an awesome beard (with no negative effects), while not sending clothes to the dry cleaners causes flies to gather around a smelly York (hindering bonuses that appear during normal gameplay). York starts with three suits, which can be changed and sent to the dry cleaners by interacting with <a href="/briefcase/3055-72/" data-ref-id="3055-72">suitcases</a>. He can also find other suits by completing side quests, with some suits also giving bonuses (for example, wearing the Passion Red suit boosts York's maximum health).</p><h3>Driving</h3><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1418653-dp_driving33.png" data-ref-id="1300-1418653" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5609375" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1418653-dp_driving33.png" data-ref-id="1300-1418653"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/17172/1418653-dp_driving33.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/17172/1418653-dp_driving33.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Driving plays a huge role in Deadly Premonition.</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Navigation and exploration of <a href="/greenvale/3035-2810/" data-ref-id="3035-2810">Greenvale</a> (the game is open world) involves driving cars. Early in the game, York obtains a "Master Key" item, which can be used to operate <a href="/police-car/3055-844/" data-ref-id="3055-844">police cars</a>. Later in the game, York can purchase faster, better-handling cars from the Greenvale Scrap Yard (including York's own car, which must be repaired). Each type of car has different speed, brake power, handling, and power. Driving different cars also plays different piece of music, while driving some cars give bonuses to York (such as York's car, which regenerates his health).</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Holding down the right trigger accelerates the car, while holding down the left trigger activates the car's brakes (when the car is moving forward) or accelerates the car in reverse. Holding down the B button activates the handbrake (for quick turns). Holding down the X button activates the sirens (only on police cars) while boosting the car's acceleration and top speed. However, using the sirens slowly fills up York's stamina bar. Pressing either bumpers change the camera angle to one of three angles (including a <a href="/first-person-perspective/3015-330/" data-ref-id="3015-330">first-person perspective</a> of York). Pressing the A button while stopped causes York to exit the vehicle, while pressing the A button while driving (at certain times) causes York to talk to the other passengers (or Zach). The D-Pad is used to toggle <a href="/windshield-wipers/3055-3613/" data-ref-id="3055-3613">windshield wipers</a> and turn signals, pressing the Y button toggles headlights, and pressing the left stick activates the horn.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">While driving, Gas and Endurance meters show up on the bottom-right corner of the screen. The Gas Meter slowly depletes as York drives, and can be replenished by driving to a <a href="/gas-station/3035-1917/" data-ref-id="3035-1917">gas station</a> . If the Gas Meter is fully depleted, the car will stop functioning. The Endurance Meter depletes as York bumps his vehicle into other cars, walls, and obstacles, and can be replenished by driving to the gas station and letting <a href="/gina-the-rose/3005-15103/" data-ref-id="3005-15103">Gina the Rose</a> (or her husband <a href="/jack-the-raging-bull/3005-15104/" data-ref-id="3005-15104">Jack the Raging Bull</a>) wash the car. If that meter is fully depleted, the car will catch on fire. Failure to exit the car quickly causes the car to explode, killing York.</p><h3>Combat</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">During certain parts of the game, York finds himself in places affected by the "Other World", an unexplained phenomenon (that only York sees) in which dangerous supernatural enemies exist. In these places, the atmosphere turns dark and grungy (often times including a rainstorm), and the player will be attacked by Shadows (corpses "possessed" by evil spirits, which cannot see but can hear human breathing).</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">York must enter these areas in specific parts of the story to progress, but the outdoors of Greenvale are also infected by the "Other World" between midnight and 6:00 A.M. In the latter scenario, York will also be attacked by ethereal birds and giant dogs. York can temporarily hide in dumpsters at this time to escape the beings (in which the Pulse Gauge rises, forcing York to abandon the dumpster when the gauge reaches maximum).</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">York has a variety of weapons to deal with Shadows, including ranged weaponry (ranging from <a href="/pistol/3055-59/" data-ref-id="3055-59">pistols</a> to <a href="/rocket-launcher/3055-211/" data-ref-id="3055-211">rocket launchers</a>) and melee weaponry (ranging from <a href="/knife/3055-295/" data-ref-id="3055-295">knives</a> to <a href="/katana/3055-690/" data-ref-id="3055-690">katanas</a>). Ranged weapons have finite ammunition (and must be reloaded) while melee weapons have finite <a href="/durability/3015-2549/" data-ref-id="3015-2549">durability</a> (and must be discarded after it breaks). Pistols have unlimited ammo, and players can find other weapons with <a href="/infinite-ammo/3015-1599/" data-ref-id="3015-1599">infinite ammo</a> or infinite duration by completing certain side-quests.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The traditional Shadows move slowly towards York (sometimes warping around to mess with his aim), sometimes in freaky stances, and either attacks with their current weapon or by grabbing York in a freakish way (both ways draining his health).</p><h3>Profiling</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">When investigating crime scenes or suspicious areas, York will come across clues and evidence tying the setting and recent events that occur there; the actual profiling is a series of non-interactive slideshows that are partially blocked out by white noise. Each profiling section consists of a set number of clues and are represented by key icons on the screen. After each clue is retrieved, players have the option to profile the crime scene again for bonus points, and each round of profiling removes more of the slideshow's white noise.</p><h3>Side Missions</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Throughout the game, players can partake in the game's fifty side missions ranging from beating a high score in a darts to driving an old lady home. Upon completion of a side mission or a set of related side missions, the player is rewarded with items such as trading cards. However, some of the more intensive tasks offer greater rewards. For example, finding an unnamed flower for George Woodman will grant access to the Radio, a device used for <a href="/fast-travel/3015-676/" data-ref-id="3015-676">fast travel</a>.</p><h2>Cars</h2><table><tbody><tr><th>Car Name</th><th>Speed</th><th>Brake</th><th>Handling</th><th>Power</th></tr><tr><td><b>Machina</b> (Carol's car)</td><td>Fast</td><td>Weak</td><td>Difficult</td><td>Low</td></tr><tr><td><b>Jogcargo</b> (Lilly's car)</td><td>Slow</td><td>Medium</td><td>Easy</td><td>Medium</td></tr><tr><td><b>SR Sportwagon</b> (Nick's car)</td><td>Slow</td><td>Medium</td><td>Easy</td><td>Medium</td></tr><tr><td><b>Wave R2000</b> (Quint's car)</td><td>Fast</td><td>Medium</td><td>Difficult</td><td>Medium</td></tr><tr><td><b>S33 Conder</b> (Richard's car)</td><td>Medium</td><td>Strong</td><td>Medium</td><td>Medium</td></tr><tr><td><b>Carmen GT</b> (Diane's car)</td><td>Slow</td><td>Medium</td><td>Easy</td><td>Medium</td></tr><tr><td><b>AppleStar</b> (Thomas' car)</td><td>Medium</td><td>Strong</td><td>Easy</td><td>Low</td></tr><tr><td><b>Mezger C600</b> (Ushah's car)</td><td>Fast</td><td>Medium</td><td>Medium</td><td>Medium</td></tr><tr><td><b>Woodland</b> (Kaysen's truck)</td><td>Medium</td><td>Strong</td><td>Difficult</td><td>Low</td></tr><tr><td><b>Rockabilly 58'</b> (Keith's car)</td><td>Fast</td><td>Weak</td><td>Medium</td><td>Low</td></tr><tr><td><b>Tough Chap</b> (Emily's car)</td></tr><tr><td><b>Elephant T-3</b> (George's car)</td></tr><tr><td><b>York's Car</b> (with unlimited gas)</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Main Characters</h2><h3><a href="/francis-york-morgan/3005-14246/" data-ref-id="3005-14246">Special Agent Francis York Morgan</a></h3><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5809/1291767-agent_morgan.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1291767" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.49180327868852" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:49.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5809/1291767-agent_morgan.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1291767"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5809/1291767-agent_morgan.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5809/1291767-agent_morgan.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Agent Francis York Morgan, on his way to Greenvale.</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">A peculiar FBI agent who specializes in profiling serial killers based on minor clues. Prefers to go by his middle name. Slightly crazy and nonsensical, he often refers to and consults a mysterious entity named "Zach" by verbally expressing his inner monologue. He smokes and hardly flinches during uncanny situations. He often references old pop culture; for example, he has a conversation about <a href="/tom-and-jerry/3025-268/" data-ref-id="3025-268">Tom &amp; Jerry</a> during the prologue. He acquired some of the scars on his face on his assignment prior to the Greenvale murder, in which he apprehended a <a href="/catwoman/3005-654/" data-ref-id="3005-654">Catwoman</a> wannabe who laced razor blades along her fingernails. He is <i>very</i> particular about his coffee, believing he can perform a type of divination from the "symbols" in the milk cloud.

He has an obsession with small town justice and fitness. After the murder, he is reluctant to let York work on the recent murder case and prides himself on his upkeep of the local police department. He has two dumbbells called "Arnold" and "Sylvester", named after famed action movie stars <a href="/arnold-schwarzenegger/3040-7493/" data-ref-id="3040-7493">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> and <a href="/sylvester-stallone/3040-60843/" data-ref-id="3040-60843">Sylvester Stallone</a>.

She often serves as a mediator between York and George, and is more willing to comply with some of York's more unconventional investigation methods; York, upon meeting her for the first time, thinks she's "easy on the eyes". While her sheriff's uniform doesn't overtly sexualize her, there are moments where players are teased with reveals of her body.

The main story starts off in a dream sequence, in which York (everyone calls him that) finds himself in an outdoor area filled with trees, red leaves, living room accouterments and angelic analogs of <a href="/isaach-ingram/3005-14653/" data-ref-id="3005-14653">Isaach</a> and <a href="/isaiah-ingram/3005-14654/" data-ref-id="3005-14654">Isaiah</a>, the twins that discovered the dead body. The mysterious scene quickly shifts to York driving to Greenvale, having a conversation about the psychological profiles of Tom and Jerry with his imaginary friend, Zach, with whom he constantly discusses his situation, <i>sotto voce</i>, in order to not be overheard by nearby people. On his way into town, he nearly runs over a person and gets into a car accident that lands him in the thick of a <a href="/forest/3035-1889/" data-ref-id="3035-1889">forest</a>.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">He begins making his way to Greenvale on foot and runs into numerous zombie-like creatures identified as "mysterious shadows", whose existence is never explained or even confirmed. Also, York has a brief encounter with <a href="/the-raincoat-killer/3005-14292/" data-ref-id="3005-14292">an axe-wielding man in a raincoat</a>, but manages to escape and finds his way out of the forest.

This time, however, one of the doors leading outside is open and he has a brief encounter with a child. Here, he runs into a lone mysterious shadow and learns that holding his breath will prevent the monsters from seeing him. After avoiding the shadow, he asks the child who he is but immediately wakes up in the local Greenvale hotel.

York believes he can divine hints about the future from the swirling shapes created when he adds milk to his coffee. Today, he sees the letters "FK". After pondering the meaning of FK, he makes his way to the <a href="/greenvale-sheriffs-department/3035-2917/" data-ref-id="3035-2917">police station</a>.</p><h3>Episode 1, Chapter 02: Sheriff office</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Upon leaving the hotel, York finds a <a href="/police-car/3055-844/" data-ref-id="3055-844">police car</a> parked outside with a note and a master key for all the town's police cars. Inside the Sheriff's office, he runs into the soft-spoken and effeminate <a href="/thomas-maclaine/3005-14338/" data-ref-id="3005-14338">Thomas MacLaine</a>, the Sheriff's Assistant. After retrieving the lost data storage key, Emily, York and Thomas peruse the victim <a href="/anna-graham/3005-14600/" data-ref-id="3005-14600">Anna Graham</a>'s case file. York, more intrigued by the taste of Thomas' homemade biscuits, is then asked to accompany George and Emily to visit the <a href="/greenvale-hospital/3035-2918/" data-ref-id="3035-2918">Greenvale General Hospital</a> and analyze Anna's autopsy results.</p><h3>Episode 1, Chapter 03: Autopsy report</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">At the Greenvale General Hospital, they meet the receptionist, <a href="/freckly-fiona/3005-14602/" data-ref-id="3005-14602">Freckly Fiona</a>, and are told to meet <a href="/ushah-johnson/3005-14339/" data-ref-id="3005-14339">Dr. Ushah Johnson</a> in the computer room. There, York solves a simple puzzle involving <a href="/chess-pieces/3055-934/" data-ref-id="3055-934">chess pieces</a> on the computer, giving them a <a href="/keycard/3055-600/" data-ref-id="3055-600">keycard</a> to the basement. The doctor and Anna's body lay in wait in the morgue, and they begin deducing the events of Anna's murder; the cause of death was from loss of blood by a cut across her abdomen. Additionally, she was gripping something in her right hand at the time of death and her tongue was bitten off by the killer. Upon closer inspection of the mouth, York finds a <a href="/red-seeds/3055-3899/" data-ref-id="3055-3899">red seed</a> embedded deep within. As a result, Anna's murder becomes tied to a series of murders marked by the presence of red seeds, one York has apparently been following personally for some time, and he declares that the investigation now falls under complete FBI jurisdiction.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">When York leaves the autopsy room to smoke a <a href="/cigarette/3055-311/" data-ref-id="3055-311">cigarette</a>, the hospital becomes affected by the "Other World", the dark and viney realm where the Mysterious Shadows dwell. He begins to see Anna Graham prancing around the halls in a red dress and follows her to the entrance. Some red ivy and three <a href="/shotgun/3055-114/" data-ref-id="3055-114">shotgun</a>-equipped shadows block the way, but he quickly dispatches them, causing the hospital to return to its regular state just as George and Emily enter the room. As they leave, <a href="/harry-stewart/3005-14337/" data-ref-id="3005-14337">Harry Stewart</a>, an eccentric wheelchair-bound millionaire who constantly wears a <a href="/gas-mask/3055-372/" data-ref-id="3055-372">gas mask</a>, and his assistant, <a href="/michael-tillotson/3005-14616/" data-ref-id="3005-14616">Michael Tillotson</a>, who inexplicably speaks in rhyme, leave York with cryptic warnings regarding the case and leave the hospital. Thomas pages Emily and the three head for the spot where the dead body was discovered.</p><h3>Episode 1, Chapter 04: Profiling</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">At the scene, York talks to <a href="/jim-green/3005-14652/" data-ref-id="3005-14652">Jim Green</a>'s two grandsons, Isaach and Isaiah, against the wishes of their grandfather and the two police officers. The twins don't seem fazed by having found Anna's body, not seeming to understand that the mutilated corpse was dead. The boys describe the scene as though they saw a <a href="/fairy/3015-2721/" data-ref-id="3015-2721">fairy</a> or goddess, and that Anna seemed happy. From the clues strewn about the forest, York deduces that Anna's body was used as an object of worship and that there was another person present at the scene of Anna's body; the stiletto heels point to one specific person in the town: <a href="/diane-ames/3005-14374/" data-ref-id="3005-14374">Diane</a>, the art gallery owner. Another clue, a small piece of metal, points York to the old lumber mill. Since Diane is out of town on business, they decide to head to the lumber mill first.</p><h3>Episode 1, Chapter 05: Murder Site</h3><figure style="width: 400px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1713305-deadlypremonitionclownfaces.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1713305" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.7" data-width="400" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:70.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1713305-deadlypremonitionclownfaces.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1713305"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/62890/1713305-deadlypremonitionclownfaces.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/62890/1713305-deadlypremonitionclownfaces.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Why so serious?</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">York drives to the lumber mill in the rain with Emily and George. He tells them to wait outside since he considers them suspects, much to their dismay. Upon setting foot inside the lumber mill, York informs Zach once again that "they're here" and enters the Other World. Inside the lumber mill, York discovers where Anna was murdered, and later has another encounter with the man in the raincoat, evidently the murderer. York remains hidden, only to be chased around the mill with the confrontation ending at an <a href="/elevator/3055-550/" data-ref-id="3055-550">elevator</a> which York cleverly triggers to separate him and the killer. At no point does he take the opportunity to pull out his gun and shoot the madman.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">York finds himself back in regular Greenvale and relates his findings to George and Emily. He explains to them that he and Zach determined that Anna was murdered in there by a someone with an inverted peace symbol on their back. He asks George and Emily to show him their backs, and they reluctantly comply. While Emily's back is totally bare, George's back is completely covered in scars -- which he does not wish to discuss. George also tells York the local legend of the Raincoat Killer, a man in a raincoat who supposedly appears on rainy days to murder people. Although the citizens of Greenvale don't really believe in the legend, they still tend to stay indoors on rainy days, to the point where local businesses close if the weather is poor. George himself doesn't believe the story, and quickly dismisses it as nothing more than a fairy tale.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The next day, George and Emily gather all of the town's citizens together at the Greenvale Community Center so that York can discuss the murder investigation with them.</p><h3>Episode 1, Chapter 06: Greenvale inhabitants</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Various citizens in the town gather in the theatre of the community center to discuss the recent murder. Along with the advice to stay away from dark places, York notes that the murderer may be imitating the fictional Raincoat Killer's methods. The townsfolk are for the most part unimpressed with Agent York. At the conclusion of York's lecture, Harry Stewart and Michael Tillotson warn the attending citizens of a "purple fog". Also, Stewart invites York to his house to exchange facts about the murder. Stewart drops hints that the case is tied to a single source and George attempts to get the information out of him, but to no avail. York decides to visit Stewart some other time.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">After the lecture, York takes the opportunity to briefly meet with all the inhabitants of Greenvale he had not yet met. The most notable appearance is by <a href="/carol-maclaine/3005-15102/" data-ref-id="3005-15102">Carol MacLaine</a>, Thomas's sister, who owns the local bar, the bizarrely named "Galaxy of Terror". Carol sparks discussion with York over smoking and starts calling the deceased Anna an "airhead". After telling Carol the twins' supposition that Anna was a goddess of the forest, she walks off.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">In a side discussion with Thomas, York asks him if he has a tattoo on his back. Thomas does, but it is a heart with "Love G" written in the center, not an inverted peace symbol, thus relieving him of suspicion. Although briefly curious as to who "G" is, York dismisses the tattoo as a sign of Thomas' reckless youth in the '80s.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Other characters that appear during the meeting include:</p><ul><li><a href="/brian-the-insomniac/3005-15101/" data-ref-id="3005-15101">Brian the Insomniac</a>, a strange man who serves as the town's graveyard custodian.</li><li><a href="/richard-dunn/3005-15109/" data-ref-id="3005-15109">Richard Dunn</a>, the owner of the only other bar in town, the equally bizarrely-named dart bar, "SWERY '65".</li><li><a href="/quint-dunn/3005-15108/" data-ref-id="3005-15108">Quint Dunn</a>, Richard's son, a <a href="/swery-65/3035-2971/" data-ref-id="3035-2971">SWERY '65</a> employee and Becky Ame's boyfriend.</li><li><a href="/the-general/3005-15110/" data-ref-id="3005-15110">The General</a>, owner of the local scrap yard and a Vietnam War veteran.</li><li><a href="/nick-cormack/3005-15107/" data-ref-id="3005-15107">Nick Cormack</a>, owner of the <a href="/ag-diner/3035-2915/" data-ref-id="3035-2915">A&amp;G Diner</a> and Olivia Cormack's husband.</li><li><a href="/olivia-cormack/3005-14748/" data-ref-id="3005-14748">Olivia Cormack</a>, A&amp;G Diner employee and Nick Cormack's wife.</li><li><a href="/wesley-the-gunsmith/3005-15111/" data-ref-id="3005-15111">Wesley the Gunsmith</a>, owner of the Panda Bear gun store and <a href="/trading-card/3055-3775/" data-ref-id="3055-3775">trading card</a> enthusiast.</li><li><a href="/keith-ingram/3005-15105/" data-ref-id="3005-15105">Keith Ingram</a>, owner of the <a href="/milk-barn/3035-2929/" data-ref-id="3035-2929">Milk Barn</a> general store and Lilly Ingram's husband.

The four have a hearty discussion about local minor crimes as well as York's previous cases. Seemingly unaware of the inappropriateness of the anecdote at the current setting, York casually discusses a serial murder case he had solved involving a man who killed women and used their bones as eating utensils or urine cups (which the murderer would later drink beverages out of without cleaning first). Additionally, he briefly mentions a student who raped eight hundred people before getting interrupted by Emily. Thomas begins crying over Anna's absence in the diner and York heads back to the hotel.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">There, he discusses case specifics with Zach, focusing on the red seed in Anna's mouth, the broken stiletto heel and the round object that left the upside-down peace mark in Anna's hand. Just before going to sleep, York recalled Emily's back and how it made him feel nostalgic and sad, though he's not sure why.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Meanwhile, a truck can be seen dropping off a woman in the middle of the rainstorm. Inside the truck is an obese man in overalls and a yellow shirt, as well as a potted sapling with a few red leaves...</p><h3>Episode 2 (part 1), Chapter 08: Muses Gallery</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Once again, York finds himself in the Red Room with Isaach and Isaiah. They talk about York's coffee habits and Anna suddenly appears with a tray and some coffee. Becky Ames also appears and repeatedly states "My name is Becky" despite York's continued questioning. The twins insist that York take a sip of Anna's coffee, and doing so opens a door in the Red Room. On the other side, he finds himself in a white room with the same child from Chapter 02. York suddenly realizes the child is himself at a young age, and vaguely references an event from his past. Awakening from his dream, York concludes that the case is directly related to him and Zach in some way.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Immediately after leaving his room, York runs into <a href="/forrest-kaysen/3005-14749/" data-ref-id="3005-14749">Forrest Kaysen</a>, the fat man from the truck. Kaysen is a travelling sapling salesman, who is constantly accompanied by his dog, Willie. Kaysen explains that he's visiting Greenvale on vacation and comes by the hotel every so often for relaxation. He also hands York one of his saplings and asks why an FBI agent is in the small town. Instead of answering, York asks about seeds, causing Kaysen to go on about his particular saplings and how he in particular is the only one who knows how to grow them. As Kaysen walks away, York ties the man to the "FK" he saw in his coffee the day before.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Over breakfast, York sees "FK" in his coffee once more, and heads out to meet Emily and George. Diane recently returned to the art gallery, so the three decide to give her a visit. Again, York wishes to investigate alone and enters the gallery by himself. Inside, he finds a distraught Olivia Cormack looking at the paintings. She explains her visit by stating a fondness for <a href="/tree/3055-643/" data-ref-id="3055-643">trees</a>. But given the abundance of real trees in town, York decides she's lying about something as she leaves the gallery.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">York eavesdrops on a conversation between Carol MacLaine and Diane Ames, ending with Carol storming angrily out of the room. Diane and York have a one-on-one chat and, despite suspicion, she has an alibi for the night Anna was killed: she was having a drink with Nick Cormack. Diane openly offers to <a href="/sex/3015-561/" data-ref-id="3015-561">sleep with</a> York, but he declines the offer and asks no further questions about the case.</p><h3>Episode 2 (part 1), Chapter 09: A&amp;G</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Outside of the gallery, York glances up towards Diane's office and spots Kaysen and Diane having a discussion. He and Emily decide to visit Nick to corroborate Diane's alibi. Inside the car, the two talk about Kaysen, and Emily mentions that he has a peculiar friendliness with Isaiah and Isaach Ingram. York decides to ask Kaysen about it later and heads to the A&amp;G Diner.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The two decide to eat before questioning Nick. Since the check will be paid by the FBI, Emily orders a T-bone <a href="/steak/3055-3521/" data-ref-id="3055-3521">steak</a> while York orders a more conservative <a href="/turkey/3055-376/" data-ref-id="3055-376">turkey</a> <a href="/sandwich/3055-1110/" data-ref-id="3055-1110">sandwich</a>. Harry and his assistant Michael enter the diner and promptly ask Olivia for Harry's order for a turkey, strawberry jam and cereal sandwich -- Nick's specialty -- is ready. York considers the order a masochistic act, and Harry (through Michael) goads him into trying one. Much to York's surprise, the sandwich tastes <i>amazing</i> and he immediately switches his order to one of his own.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">When York and Emily finally start eating, the two have a heartfelt discussion about their younger days. Emily moved from <a href="/seattle/3035-517/" data-ref-id="3035-517">Seattle</a> when she was in high school and, due to unfounded gossip that she would sleep with anyone, she doesn't pry into the personal lives of the town's citizens. To empathize, York tells Emily about how he used to be a hardcore punk rocker and how no one would take him seriously because he dressed the part, even though he got good grades. Emily laughs at the thought of York as a punk rocker, and they decide to finally begin questioning Nick about his relationship with Diane.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Nick states that he and Diane were merely talking about Rembrandt and Turner the night Anna was killed. Judging by Nick's reaction, York could easily tell he was hiding something from him; Nick says he's busy working and tells York to go away. On the other hand, Olivia says she never goes drinking with Nick and Diane and mentions how she isn't into art. This gives York the opportunity to question her presence at the art gallery and he's told to meet her at the back of the diner one hour after it closes.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">At the designated time, Olivia mentions how Nick became friendly with Diane and often returns early in the morning. Understandably suspicious that her husband may be cheating on her, she followed him one night and saw that they left the bar for the art gallery. Before Diane entered the gallery, Olivia could have sworn Diane was staring directly at her; the next day, Anna was dead. Her confrontation with York at the gallery was due to her need to see Diane regarding her husband, however she couldn't go through with it. Just then, Emily gets a radio message from Thomas, stating that something is happening at Becky Ames' house and that the Raincoat Killer was mentioned. York leaves Emily to take care of Olivia while he goes to investigate Becky's house.</p><h3>Episode 2 (part 1), Chapter 10: The 2nd sacrifice</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">In the midst of thunderstorm, York makes his way to Becky's house to find Thomas and a hysterical Quint sitting outside. When York asks about what happened, Quint repeatedly moans about Becky and Thomas says he has been like that since arriving on the scene. York enters Becky's house alone, telling Thomas to follow George's orders when he and Emily arrive.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Inside, York encounters the Other World once more and begins profiling using new clues. York runs into the Raincoat Killer and, once again, escapes. Soon after, York discovers Becky was killed while she was sleeping and her body was left hanging in the adjacent bathroom. Just after he finds her, George, Thomas, and Emily arrive in the bathroom as well. Surprisingly, Becky was still alive, but, like Anna, her tongue was cut out by the killer. York attempts to get information out of her, but George, wishing to take Becky to the hospital, cuts a wire holding her up. Cutting the wire springs a trap and breaks Becky's neck. In the instant before her death, York has a vision of Anna reaching out to Becky, which is broken when she coughs up red seeds and a key to a safe. All four investigators are thoroughly shaken, and Thomas vo Official Websitemits in Becky's toilet.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Behind a painting in Becky's bedroom, a safe containing a sketchbook reveals she was the women wearing stiletto heels at Anna's murder site. Fearing that the killer would catch her if she left the house, she entrusted the broken shoe and a locket to Isaach and Isaiah, and told them to deliver the items to her sister, Diane. Emily is surprised that York is surprised by this information, assuming he already knew that Diane and Becky were sisters.</p><h3>Episode 2 (part 2), Chapter 11: Lost child</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The chapter opens up with York questioning Keith and Lilly Ingram about Becky, who worked with them at the Milk Barn general store. She stopped showing up to work and Lilly dismissed the absence as shock. To cheer her up, she took the twins to see Becky. They came back from the visit with a small box yet weren't privy to the contents. When asked where the twins were, the Ingrams said they were with Forrest Kaysen at the <a href="/greenvale-forest-park/3035-2849/" data-ref-id="3035-2849">Greenvale Forest Park</a>.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">At the park, Emily and York question the twins about their visit to Becky's house, but the two remain adamant in over the fact that they promised Becky that they wouldn't tell anyone. York tricks the twins by countering them with a fake promise and they divulge their secret. They were told to give Diane the box, and when they did, they were called back and were given a locket. Carol asked for the locket, but the twins persisted in delivering it. However, York mentions that Kaysen was present when Carol took the locket from Diane; as a result, Kaysen is labelled as a key witness and ordered not to leave the town.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">York goes over the events of the case again with Zach, focusing on Nick and Diane's visit to the art gallery, Quint's presence at Becky's house prior to the tragedy, Becky's sketch book and the twins' mysterious errands. At this point, Nick and Quint had no alibis for Becky's death, but York remains fixated on Diane Ames' suspiciousness. York rounds up the police force and proposes that they gather more information about Nick and Diane's relationship. George, Emily, and Thomas are assigned to watch the art gallery, the diner, and the bar, respectively.</p><h3>Episode 2 (part 2), Chapter 12: Fallen goddess</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Later that night, the four get into position and begin tracking the actions of Nick and Diane. Emily waits across the street from the Galaxy of Terror with York just as it begins raining. Thomas tells them that Nick is leaving the bar while there's no strange reports from George at the gallery. Thomas joins Emily and York, and the three follow Nick to Muse's Gallery. However, just before arriving at the gallery, York barely dodges a truck and loses Nick. At the gallery, George reports that he hasn't seen Nick and that Diane hasn't left the area. When questioned whether he was feeling well, George admits to having a little drink, but insists that he's not drunk. York remains confident that Nick <i>is</i> inside regardless of George's diligence.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Behind the gallery was a small cabin with a ladder leading underground. Just before York enters, Emily surprises him with her interest in him and Zach. As always, York tells her to stay put as he goes to investigate. As always, the site has now passed into the Other World, filled with Mysterious Shadows, and a new supernatural foe, the absurdly durable Wall Ladies. Based on evidence and profiling, York determined that Diane met with the Raincoat Killer and was murdered inside the gallery.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">After reaching the lobby of the gallery, York finds Nick unconscious on the ground with Diane's body hanging above the tree statue on display. Letting Emily, George and Thomas inside they discover that, like Becky, Diane isn't dead yet. In an attempt to make sure her body doesn't fall on the statue's sharp points, the surprisingly strong George begins moving it while York leaps from the second floor balcony to catch her. They recover Diane successfully and Emily tells Thomas to call an ambulance. However, Diane regains consciousness and inexplicably begins describing the tree statue as though giving a tour of the gallery, tongueless, with blood spouting out of her mouth. Nick, regaining consciousness himself, bumps George into the statue while resisting arrest. The statue starts falling as Emily tries unsuccessfully to get Diane out of the way. York quickly pushes Emily away, and Diane is crushed (literally <a href="/gibs/3015-334/" data-ref-id="3015-334">gibbed</a>) by the massive weight of the sculpture.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Suddenly, Willie the dog arrives on the scene and York dutifully follows the dog to Diane's room. Inside, York finds a locked trap door, leading to a small alcove containing Kaysen. When asked what he was doing in the gallery, Kaysen confessed to being in a friends-with-benefits relation with Diane, and would often visit the town to engage in such frivolities. For his alibi, he stated that he and Diane were having a drink until Nick showed up and, by a change of heart, she locked him up in the alcove, thus relieving him of suspicion. However, he <i>did</i> hear footsteps that sounded like they were coming from heavy boots.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">York then takes the time to reassess the current situation with Zach, focusing on Nick's unconsciousness, Kaysen's presence, and the sound of bootsteps he heard. Also, he grows concerned for George, who feels guilty for unintentionally triggering the deaths of both Becky and Diane.</p><h3>Episode 2 (part 2), Chapter 13: Past</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">At the sheriff's department, George asks York if he could have a private discussion at the bar. There, the two have frank talks about the past, most of which came from George. He explains that the myriad scars on his back come from his childhood, when his mother would discipline George with the "Tree Punishment", where he'd be whipped with a tree branch repeatedly, claiming it hurt the tree more than it did him. Despite the trauma in his unhappy childhood, George has a bit of gratitude for his mother for shaping him into the man he is. He reaffirms his guilt over Becky and Diane's deaths and apologizes to York (who he finally calls that) for being arrogant. York assures him that he shouldn't feel bad and briefly leaves him to talk to Carol. With confidence, Carol says Nick wasn't responsible and begins singing (badly, although it is unclear whether it is the character's or just the voice actress' failing) onstage.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">After Carol's performance, Emily shows up and wishes to join George and York over drinks. George says he's had enough for the night and leaves York alone with Emily. The two have another discussion, this time revolving around Emily's past. She admits that George asked her out at one point and offers information about her parents, who died years ago. The two exit the bar and Emily leaves York with a strange request for him "not to lie".</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Back at the hotel, York once again goes over new details of the case with Zach. A new development that piqued his interest was the recentness of Nick's injury to the time of discovery. At this point in time, Nick becomes the most questionable person and the prime suspect.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Just before turning in for the night, York hears a knock on his door and finds Emily on the other side when he opens it. York talks a bit about his own parents before Emily asks about Zach. York says that Zach is his only friend, but one he's never seen the face of. He "met" Zach when he was seven; he heard his mother crying, went to see what the problem was and saw his father pointing a gun at her. His father told the young York, "At times we must purge things from this world because they should not exist, even if it means losing someone that you love." The elder Morgan then murdered York's mother and committed suicide. After fainting, York woke up, heard Zach's voice telling him everything would be alright, and became friends with him ever since.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Emily thanks York for saving her life and leaves him for the night. Before falling asleep, he seems to think she is developing certain feelings for Zach, and jokingly declares himself and Zach rivals regarding Emily.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The scene shifts to a freshly arrested Nick Cormack, who is begging a not-actually-present Thomas to let him out of his cell. His cries go unheard, as it appears the sheriff's office is completely empty. The scene shifts once more to Carol MacLaine, who's being comforted by an unidentified figure. Both are wearing the same red dress, and a picture suggests that Anna, Becky and Diane had very close ties to the murderer.</p><h3>Episode 3, Chapter 14: Tea break</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The third episode begins as York finds himself in a mysterious white room. He works his way through a maze of doors and comes face-to-face with an elderly man dressed in a white suit (actually a maskless Harry Stewart, although this is never openly commented on) who tells York that once he enters the door behind him, there's no turning back. With no other place to turn, York enters the last door and confronts a memory from his past: the moment in which his father held his mother at gunpoint. As the child version of York reached out to his mother, she becomes a Mysterious Shadow and started to attack.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Waking up from the dream, York has another round of breakfast and coffee at the hotel. Much like the FK from before, the coffee left him with a lead. This time, the coffee left a ring on his newspaper, encircling the letters H-A-R-R-Y on an advertisement; with this, he leaves the hotel to pay the mysterious capitalist a visit. Outside of the hotel, Emily reports that Thomas has gone missing; while the police force goes searching for Thomas, York persists in visiting Harry. At this, Emily mutters how idiotic she was for thinking York was "a good pick".</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Inside Harry's mansion, he is greeted by Michael and tasked with solving a puzzle before meeting up with Harry. After solving the puzzle, Harry, who speaks for himself for the first time, offers York some tea and tells York that the red seeds that link all the murders in Greenvale and many more outside are found somewhere in the town, a place "most crowded and most quiet [that] gives a cold sensation". He will tell York more when he solves this riddle. The FBI Agent leaves the mansion to search for the red seeds.</p><h3>Episode 3, Chapter 15: Red seed</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">York determines that the place he's looking for is the graveyard (which is crowded with the silent dead), and promptly heads there. There, he finds Brian the Insomniac and asks him if he's seen a tree that drops red seeds. Brian points toward the back end of the graveyard and brings three prominent red trees to York's attention. After fighting his way through several Mysterious Shadows, York takes a handful of red seeds and heads back to Harry's mansion.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">He is once again greeted by Michael, who tasks him with another silly puzzle, before he is able to reach Harry's room. York drops the red seeds as proof of his cleverness and Harry begins his explanation. He tells York a story about events that occurred in Greenvale fifty years ago. After the construction of the town clock tower, a man began wearing a red raincoat went mad murdered a large number of people. Under a gag order, the multiple homicide was kept under wraps by the military. York questions Harry's knowledge and he simply leaves him with the fact that he himself was an eyewitness to the Raincoat Killer's actions.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Around ten to twenty years ago, Harry noticed something special about the red seeds and discovered a fabricated legend stating that eating the red seeds and murdering someone will grant a person immortality. He supposes that the current Raincoat Killer is using the old serial killer's methods to carry out the legend of the red seeds. He sends York to find old documents inside the sheriff's office proving the Raincoat Killer existed back in the 50's.</p><h3>Episode 3, Chapter 16: Hidden memories</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">George still considers the Raincoat Killer mere folklore and Emily agrees, saying Harry just likes to playing with people's minds. However, York persists and Emily opens the file room for him to peruse. Inside, the file room has become a twisted labyrinth of the Other World. And when York reaches the end, he discovers the files he was looking for were completely removed shortly before he arrived. He questions George and Emily about the missing files and they remember that the missing Thomas has access to the file room at all times.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">York asks Emily for some coffee with milk on the side, claiming that it's very important. Once again, the coffee points him in another direction; more specifically, Velvet Falls, and requests a visit there. George complies with York's request since he's certain the waterfall will give them a bit of power in the least. York is certain he'll find something merely by fishing at the site, and the three temporarily cease their concern for Thomas' absence to head to the waterfall.</p><h3>Episode 3, Chapter 17: New Raincoat Killer</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">York begins fishing and miraculously catches the missing documents from the waterfall. The three look at them with incredulity, as they are a clear outline for the Raincoat Killer's methods. George confirms that the documents were written by Thomas and York wishes to take them to Harry, stating that this proves the existence of the "New Raincoat Killer". Despite his dislike for Harry, George approves of York's actions while he and Emily search for Thomas.</p><h3>Episode 3, Chapter 18: The 13th bell</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">When arriving at Harry's mansion, York enters and finds it has been affected by the Other World. Inside, he finds a painting of women in red dresses, resembling Anna, Becky, Diane, Carol and Emily, walking around a forest; also, he has visions of Emily and his father pointing a gun at her. When he reaches Harry's room, he discovers a secret passage leading to a small, underground base. The effects of the Other World subside, and he finds Harry in the midst of numerous monitors and bookshelves.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">After glancing over the documents, Harry tells his full story. One rainy night fifty years ago, he snuck out of his house after an argument with his father, intending to see and climb the new clock tower. At the top, he saw soldiers wearing gas masks, messing around with a device emitting purple smoke that was filling the town with purple fog. The bell began ringing, and he ran from the tower. The purple fog spread, and he headed home as the bell rang a thirteenth time. When he arrived in town, he discovered to his horror that under the influence of the purple fog, the townsfolk were running wild and berserk, viciously killing each other for no reason; most notably, there was an axe-wielding man in a red raincoat who was particularly strong taking out every person who challenged him. Just then, Harry himself was filled with rage and the urge to kill. He blindly attacked the man in the raincoat, and realized the man under the hood was his father. Immediately losing the fight, he was knocked out and woke up surrounded by dead bodies. His mother was among them, apparently slain by his father, the original Raincoat Killer. The town was taken over by the military, who suppressed all word of the purple fog incident and the devastating murders that resulted. Although they weren't allowed to tell even their children the truth about what had happened, the townsfolk never went out in the rain thereafter.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">After the event, the purple fog chemical absorbed into the ground, and to this day a small amount of purple gas is released whenever it rains, affecting the moods of anyone out in the rain at the time. Harry and York determine that the red seeds and the purple fog have a pronounced effect on the New Raincoat Killer. Just then, Harry's monitors alert him that Thomas has just been found and York gets ready to leave. However, Harry leaves York with an eerily familiar saying: "At times, we must purge things from this world because they should not exist, even if it means losing someone that you love."</p><h3>Episode 3, Chapter 19: Apartment</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Outside of Harry's mansion, Emily pulls up they drive over to Thomas' apartment building. The two arrive and find George already on the scene; they received an anonymous call informing them that Thomas had returned home. York decides to head up to the apartment alone. He makes a startling discovery when he investigates the clues strewn around Thomas' apartment: it seems that somebody has entertained the Raincoat Killer at Thomas' house on at least one occasion. York surmises that Thomas is trying to insinuate that the mystery is deeper than it seems and that they need to look into the issue further as George and Emily burst into the room, worried over the sound of a vase shattering.</p><h3>Episode 3, Chapter 20: Cruel Device</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">As York leaves Thomas' apartment building, Emily and George leave hurriedly. Because it is after midnight, the entire town shifts into the Other World. Seeing Anna Graham once more, York leaves his car and chases after her on foot, believing she is leading him somewhere. He arrives at the Galaxy of Terror eventually, but Anna is scared off before he can speak to her by the sudden appearance of the New Raincoat Killer. York rushes into the bar as cover, but it's apparent that the bar, too is infested with Mysterious Shadows and Wall Ladies.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">York decides to profile the place to see what's going on, but the Raincoat Killer has also gotten entry to the bar and begins to chase him. After the New Raincoat Killer loses track of him on several occasions, York finds Thomas' sheriff badge and an ice pick. After another short encounter with the New Raincoat Killer, his conclusions lead him to be able to enter a certain room in the Galaxy, now back to normal. As York investigates, he discovers the locket that Anna had been holding when she died. Before he can do anything about it, however, he is knocked out by Thomas, who is <a href="/cross-dressing/3015-3705/" data-ref-id="3015-3705">dressed as a woman</a>. As York lies handcuffed on the floor, Thomas dances to a recording of his sister singing.</p><h3>Episode 4, Chapter 21: Cat Fight</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">York, now actually seeing <i>himself</i> as a child, finds himself and his long-dead father in a forest. York calls out to to his father as he leaves him behind, who replies with "Come on, boy! Or it'll be too late!" This exchange is repeated several times as York follows his father through the forest at a rather sluggish pace. Eventually, York arrives in a small clearing with his father nowhere in sight. York is initially distraught, but a full-grown Emily appears before him in a red dress and consoles him. Willie the dog also appears and licks York's face.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">(Adult) York once again finds himself in the Red Room with Angels Isaach and Isaiah, as well as Anna, Becky, and Diane. The three women are seen whispering to one another and giggling while passing a bobblehead doll with the appearance of Forrest Kaysen between them. The twins, with extremely stoned looks on their faces, tell York that "It's going to start soon" and that "the person he is waiting for" will be here soon. Suddenly, one of the trees nearby begins to crack and burst, spraying what appears to be <a href="/blood/3015-512/" data-ref-id="3015-512">blood</a> all over the place.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Back inside the secret chamber in the Galaxy of Terror, George and Emily are seen talking with Kaysen. Kaysen had told them that he saw York enter the bar, and they had gone inside to investigate. Kaysen then gets the idea to have Willie track York's scent. George stays behind to investigate some more, and Emily (now the playable character) and Kaysen follow Willie as he runs in circles through the central section of Greenvale. During this sequence, the perspective occasionally switches to York who is blindfolded in an unknown location. He tries, unsuccessfully, to reason with Thomas and reminisces over his time spent with Emily, whom he has grown to deeply care for.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">After entirely too much time has passed, Emily, Kaysen, and Willie arrive at the Greenvale Community Center. Following York's example, Emily tells Kaysen to wait outside and goes inside by herself to investigate. To her initial shock and horror, she finds herself in the Other World, fighting Mysterious Shadows just as York has. Emily, armed with a special Sheriff's Department-issued handgun that is inexplicably <i>far</i> more powerful than York's FBI-issued handgun, makes her way to the top of the clock tower and confronts Thomas, who now reveals himself to be <a href="/insanity/3015-1503/" data-ref-id="3015-1503">totally insane</a>. She, too, fails to reason with him, and the first boss battle of the game finally commences. Emily fires at Thomas while he leaps across spinning gears, while Thomas attacks by swinging large hooks towards Emily and occasionally firing his revolver at her. After defeating him, Thomas makes strange comments indicating that he is intensely jealous of Emily, and pulls a knife, but is thwarted by the sudden intervention of Willie, who bites his arm. Thomas' knife gets knocked into the air and stabs him in his chest, then he falls from the gear and is impaled through the head on a sharp hook.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">With Thomas dead, Willie unties York, who berates Emily for letting "the killer" get away. Emily expresses confusion, having assumed that the clearly psychotic Thomas was the murderer. York reveals that he has determined although Thomas was an accomplice, he was not the actual killer. Instead, the murderer is "Love G" himself, the person Thomas was in love with, the person whose affection towards Emily made Thomas jealous, the one person who does not have an alibi for any of the killings.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Sheriff George Woodman is the New Raincoat Killer.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">York explains to a completely shocked Emily that while George does not have a <i>tattoo</i> on his back, there is a <i>pattern</i> there amongst the scars. York has Kaysen drop himself and Emily off at the sheriff's office.</p><h3>Episode 4, Chapter 22: The Throne of Abyss</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">At the sheriff's office, York orders Kaysen to stay at the entrance, but asks for Emily to secure the back of the building. As he heads into the sheriff's office, which once again seems to be in the Other World, he plans on tracking down George. He sees an apparition of Anna again, this time running through a door, and he follows her, eventually finding a cunningly hidden key for a hidden room. The hidden room, it seems, is contained within one of the holding cells in the basement as he discovers when Anna runs through it again. After York manages to obtain the key and enter the room, which is set up as an almost religious motif towards the red seeds and the murders, he finds Carol's earrings - and Carol herself.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Emily bursts into the room, and both she and York stare at Carol calmly brushing her hair, with clumps of it falling to the floor. As blood drips onto Emily's face, she looks up to see a freshly drawn "inverted peace mark" symbol on the ceiling, drawn with blood. Carol seems in too much pain to be aware as Emily calls out to her, and she collapses to the floor. As Emily rushes over to help her out, she struggles to speak without her tongue, but obviously wanting to speak of Thomas, Emily sadly explains that she had to kill him. Carol, now communicating through writing on the floor in her own blood, tells them that she and Thomas were "substitutes", and that George really loves Emily. Suddenly enraged, Carol grabs some red seeds and shoves them into Emily's mouth. York pulls Emily away, Carol finally dies, and Emily is inexplicably sickened by the brief contact with the seeds.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Screaming for Kaysen, York gets Emily out of the building and into Kaysen's truck, ordering him to take Emily straight to the hospital to cleanse her stomach and liver. When he finds out that York intends to go after George, Kaysen protests, wanting York to come with them, but he refuses. Kaysen leaves with Emily, as George stands over Carol's body in his New Raincoat Killer get up and starts laughing maniacally.</p><h3>Episode 5, Chapter 23: Dawn</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">George, now fully decked out as the New Raincoat Killer, briefly appears at the door, taunting York and disappearing inside. York pursues him, musing about asking Emily out on a date when the case is over. As York battles his way through the sheriff's office, which hasn't yet returned to normal and is stuffed full of Mysterious Shadows in police uniforms, he comes across the New Raincoat Killer. Instead of running and hiding, York continues doggedly chasing him, despite having axes thrown at him. They return to the hidden room under the police department, and York ascends a giant staircase that leads him outside of the police station, and straight to George.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Having doffed his raincoat, George and York talk. George, now wearing a ridiculous outfit, enthuses over what a powerful town Greenvale is, and its two treasures: the red seeds and their power, and Emily herself. He reminisces over when Emily first came to Greenvale and how it made him feel like a fool when she turned him down, which York cuttingly agrees with. George turns this around by saying that if anybody's a fool it's York, for watching Becky, Diane and Carol die right in front of him and being unable to do anything about it. He also explains that he learned from his mother that the strong will always overpower the weak and that it's "good and right" for such a thing to happen, casually mentioning that he got the wicked scar on his face when his abusive mother put her stiletto heel through his cheek. Now that he has completed all the murders required for the red seed legend, George feels that he's now divine, and all he needs now is Emily, the goddess, to be his bride, despite York saying such a plan won't work.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">George also explains about how, when he was deer hunting, he shot some deer that just wouldn't die, no matter how many bullets he pumped into them. Although he wondered if they were perhaps <a href="/undead/3015-1155/" data-ref-id="3015-1155">undead</a> zombie deer, It turned out that they had red seeds in their stomach, and he concluded that those seeds really had made them invincible. George, declaring himself the "chosen one", then eats more red seeds and transforms, his body becoming more muscular, revealing that the red seeds really do possess supernatural traits after all. George and York then fight, with George wielding his axe to minimum effect.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Upon losing to York, George talks about the involvement of the four women he killed. He explains that Carol, Thomas and George had a secret "club", and Becky and Anna immediately joined. When they met, George fed them the seeds and sleazily discusses their reactions, apparently acting as an aphrodisiac to the women, and why he chose Anna to be the first. York tries to break down what he's saying in terms of a murderer and his victims, and his framing of Thomas, which amuses George. He claims that it's thanks to Thomas in the first case that George had even heard the legend of the Raincoat Killer, even though he hadn't believed in it. George believes his life's misfortunes were really just trials on the way to him becoming divine, and his body transforms again, both his hair and skin texture changing until he barely looks human at all.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Despite his superhuman power, George loses the fight again and totally breaks down, crying and apologizing to his mother for having murdered the girls, babbling about having done nothing wrong, and that it's really the fault of the "he" who gave him a present: the locket that George was told makes him the Chosen One. Pulling himself together, they go to fight again, but York dispatches George with ease as York shoots George's axe back at him, leaving it embedded in his chest. Before he can even fall down and die from his fatal wound, lightning strikes the axe, killing George, leaving his body charred and blackened, casting the shadow of an inverted peace sign. The New Raincoat Killer is finally dead. However, York is knocked out by his proximity to the lightning.</p><h3>Episode 5, Chapter 24: Red tree</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Young York runs through a corridor of red leaves, talking to Angel Isaiah and Isaach, the four "goddesses", Thomas (still cross-dressed), and his mother, who all impart some kind of advice or encouragement, as well as his father, who basically acts like a dick. As he goes through the door at the end of the corridor, he finds Harry, once more without his mask on, and Emily. Harry apologizes that he can't let York go with his parents, but that he needs to open an envelope. York looks into it, but it isn't clear what he sees.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">(Adult) York wakes up at the hospital with Dr. Johnson at his bedside, and immediately inquires about how Emily is doing. Dr. Johnson expresses surprise at his question, and explains that Emily hasn't come to the hospital, and when York explains that he told Kaysen to bring Emily to the hospital, Dr. Johnson comments that Kaysen was the one who brought York. He also left an envelope for York, identical to the one in his dream, containing a crudely-drawn map of where he should go. York follows the directions, and finds himself at the late George Woodman's house.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">George's house appears to be empty, with everything taped up and the doors covered. York discovers a door to the basement, though, which turns out to be a bedroom. Every available surface is covered with photos of Emily, which disturbs York. In another room in the basement, York finds the dessicated corpse of a long-dead woman in a chair, which seems to have saplings growing from it, and remarks upon it being George's mother. As he picks the sapling from the body, York recognizes the shadow it makes - the presumed "inverted peace mark" is actually a tree. He connects it to the similar sapling Kaysen carries around with him at all times, as well as his coffee premonitions, and concludes that the "he" George referred to was in fact Forrest Kaysen. York finds a note written on a photograph of Kaysen and George together telling him to go to the Community Center.</p><h3>Episode 6, Chapter 25: Zach Morgan</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">In 1956, Greenvale went crazy. The original Raincoat Killer (currently controlled by the player) fights his way through the rest of the townsfolk to the Community Center and its clocktower before it strikes 13. As he stares up, he sees the soldiers operating the purple fog machine, and the gas billowing out into the air. It is revealed that one of the soldiers is in fact Forrest Kaysen, who looks exactly as he does today, proving his seed-bound immortality. Watching the town go to Hell, Kaysen laughs manically while the Raincoat Killer rages on the ground far beneath him.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The player regains control of York as he, too, stands staring up at the clocktower, fifty years later. It is revealed that the purple fog has once again enveloped Greenvale, and behind York, all the formerly friendly citizens of Greenvale (and Jack) come towards him, looking ready to kill him. Isaac and Isaiah run up behind the inexplicably immune York, claiming they're scared of how strangely other people are acting, but they are obviously affected too, as they stab him in the leg with a pair of scissors. Reluctant to hurt the people who don't know what they're doing, York backs away into the Community Center (Alternatively, the player slaughters them all without mercy).</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">As he steps through the door, York enters the "white" other world and is warned of the finality of his decision to proceed. Undeterred, he goes straight into the theatre, where Emily is sitting down, apparently sleeping, a plant sitting on her lap. York tells Kaysen that George is dead, but Forrest seems to find the whole thing hilarious, dismissing George as "small-minded and stupid". Kaysen mocks York for leaving Emily alone with him, and salivates about the fun he's had with Emily, bragging about what he did. Impatient, York shoots at him, but Kaysen goads him deliberately by kissing Emily when she's confused and believes that it's York. He also reveals his long, lizard-like tongue, which knocks Emily into wakefulness.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Emily apologizes to York for kissing Kaysen, but he dismisses it and tells her he'll take her to the hospital. Emily explains that she can't go to him as she's been "soiled", which York vehemently denies. As she gets up to explain herself somewhat hysterically, the blanket that had been across her body drops to the floor and York sees that she's nearly naked and a sapling is growing straight out of her stomach. Seeing York's expression, Kaysen gleefully repeats one of his first lines, about how growing his saplings requires a "certain technique" that only he knows, and laughs hysterically.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Emily begs for York to kill her and prevent the sapling from growing and bringing more red seeds into the world, and York begs Zach for guidance. Suddenly, he has a flashback to the day his parents died, but it's different - the truth. Once again, young York watches from the doorway, but this time, Forrrest Kaysen is in the room with his mother and father, and it is apparent that his mother has a sapling growing from her stomach. Like Emily did to York, York's mother begs his father to kill her. His father begs Kaysen to let her go, but Kaysen says that when it progresses so far, there's nothing even he can do about it. His father can't bring himself to shoot the woman he loves, which Kaysen finds hilarious, and the sapling suddenly undergoes a horrible growth spurt, fully sprouting as York's mother dies in agony, her body shrivelling and becoming disfigured. Weeping bitterly, York's father sees the boy standing in the doorway, and gives the now familiar speech about removing things from the world even if it means losing someone you love, and then cowardly shoots himself in the head.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">However...</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">When he speaks to the boy standing in the door, he calls him <i>Zach</i>, not <i>York</i>. It is revealed that the man the player has been controlling the entire game is really named Francis <i>Zach</i> Morgan, and that <i>York</i> was the imaginary friend who appeared after the death of his parents. In reality, the man's hair is white, not brown, and the scar over his eye is painful-looking, not long-healed, which explains the townspeople's obsession with it. Unable to deal with the impossibly traumatic scene he'd witnessed, Zach had "traded places" with York, with York becoming the dominant personality and not letting him remember the truth about the incident or perceiving the way he really looked. The flashback ends with Kaysen telling young Zach that he saw him and striking him, inflicting the wound that would become his scar.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">We then witness the moment the man's personality changed so drastically. In the white room, young Zach, with white hair and blood splattered around his eye from the wound Kaysen just inflicted on him, stands horrified at what he'd just seen. Young York shows up and proclaims himself Zach's friend who'll be there forever to help him get through the trauma. As young Zach takes young York's hand, the flashback ceases and the player takes control of an adult FBI Agent Francis Zachary Morgan, white hair, ugly scar, and all. Zach now recalls that he traded places with his alternate personality, York, after the incident. Zach is now the one begging York for guidance, but York says he must decide for himself, although he'll back him up whatever decision he makes.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">In one of these choices, Zach tries to shoot Emily as she asks, but finds himself unable to do so, deliberately missing instead. Unlike Zach's mother, Emily decides to take matters into her own hands and rips the sapling from her body, causing <i>incredible</i> damage to her internal organs, but killing the plant before it could bloom. While Kaysen inexplicably rejoices, Zach runs to Emily to try and comfort her in her final moments. She smiles at his compliments, and then he sees her in the White Room, going to join the rest of the "goddesses" (and the murderous, psychopathic Thomas, for some reason). She claims to now understand both York and Zach, and as Zach watches, the familiar figure of York goes over to join them. He encourages Zach, and Zach finally is able to talk to Emily himself. When he is pulled out of that world, Emily lies dead on the theatre stage, and Zach covers her with his jacket.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Kaysen is surprised and enraged about Zach having been brought back from the red room, and uses the power granted him by the seeds to transform into a disgusting, slimy creature. Zach defeats him, and Kaysen complains about the foolishness of humans and how they react to the gas created from the red seeds. Watching the effects of the seeds gives him something to laugh at in his centuries-long life. Proclaiming he's had enough fun for one day and that it's time for Zach to die, Kaysen transforms again and becomes even bigger. He stomps on the floor and Zach falls through it, into an impossibly huge under-chamber with a spiral staircase. Kaysen follows Zach down himself, and starts to chase Zach as he runs up to the clocktower.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">As Zach bursts through the door to the clocktower, Kaysen rushes through after him and is flung off the side of the clocktower. The battle isn't over, though, as he transforms one final time into a giant version of Kaysen's original humanoid appearance, peering into the clocktower and clutching a bobblehead version of himself. Kaysen's entire body is invulnerable, but he takes damage when Zach shoots the bobblehead. This time, when Zach defeats him, his face opens up and tentacles and a giant eyeball protrudes from where it used to be, which Zach shoots while commenting on Kaysen's lack of understanding of humans. This time, Forrest Kaysen is killed once and for all, and with him dead, the red seeds will eventually disappear from this world.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">All of the citizens of Greenvale wake up from their temporary insanity, confused. Miraculously, nobody killed each other while under the influence of the gas, which disappeared once Kaysen died. Meanwhile, Francis Zach Morgan descends the clocktower and returns to Emily's body, picking it up and talking to it about how she ended up with York after all. He deliberately steps on Kaysen's bobblehead on the way out.</p><h3>Episode 7, Chapter 26: Epilogue</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">At Harry Stewart's mansion, Zach looks at the painting of the "goddesses", noting this time that it also inexplicably depicts a cross-dressing Thomas. Harry comes over in his wheelchair and asks Zach whether he believed any of the story he'd told him. Zach considers it unimportant, given that he couldn't save Emily, but Harry expresses sympathy about what happened anyway. He talks about the strangeness of the painting, but Zach wants to know about Harry's last name. Harry admits that "Harry Stewart" isn't his actual name; it's Harry <i>Woodman</i>, and he is George's biological father. When asked about his presence in the White Room, he evades the question, saying that Kaysen had put him in the same situation as Zach's father and Zach himself, and that much like the two of them, he'd also been unable to shoot the woman he loved. Being made of stronger stuff than Zach's father, though, he didn't kill himself either, resulting in losing both his wife and son, George blaming Harry for his mother's death. Harry, too, still blames himself for what happened, but he's glad Zach has at long last put an end to the madness. Zach ponders about the happiness of the victims, but Harry assures him that York will guide them to the forest.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Later, being driven back to the hotel by Michael, Zach spots Emily in the woods. He excuses himself and goes over to the area where he saw her, finding Jim, the twins, and Willie. He and Jim talk about the sadness of what has happened in Greenvale, and how the twins are doing. The twins then come and give something to Zach, claiming it's from Emily, as she's too shy to pass it along herself. She is, however, there with "another Zach". The twins tell Zach how much Emily likes him, but he claims she really loves York instead. As Jim and the twins wander off, Zach talks to York and Emily, explaining that he's figured out the <i>real</i> reason George put Anna's body in the forest: he wanted the twins to find her. Without explaining this totally bizarre statement, Zach says his final goodbyes to York, Emily, the "goddesses", and Thomas, and leaves the woods.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">After dealing with any further business, Zach makes up his mind to leave Greenvale with the case solved. As he signs out of the Great Deer Yard Hotel, he spots Polly's photograph from the construction of the clocktower. Kaysen is in it, looking just as he always has, of course. Shrugging it off, Zach talks to Polly about his "very good friend who he can't speak to anymore", and Polly sympathizes but expresses her opinion that his friend will be fine. Grinning, Zach agrees with her assessment.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Leaving any cars he may have bought from the General behind, Zach leaves town on foot. As he leaves Greenvale for the last time, Zach is watched by Willie, who has the doll of Kaysen in his mouth, and a bee flies off into the distance.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Meanwhile, in the afterlife, which looks strangely like the A&amp;G Diner, York and Emily enthusiastically kiss while Anna, Becky, Carol, Diane, and Thomas look on happily.</p><h2>System Requirements</h2><h3>Minimum</h3><ul><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 7 / Vista (32/64 bit)</li><li><strong>Processor: </strong>Intel Dual Core 2.0Ghz or equivalent</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2 GB RAM</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Direct X 9.0c compliant video card with 512MB RAM</li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 9.0c</li><li><strong>Hard Drive: </strong>8 GB available space</li><li><strong>Sound Card:</strong> Direct X compatible sound card</li></ul><h3>Recommended</h3><ul><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 7 / Vista (32/64 bit)</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Quad Core 1.6Ghz / AMD Quad Core 1.6Ghz</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM</li><li><strong>Graphics: </strong>DirectX 9.0c compatible NVIDIA or AMD ATI video card with 1GB of RAM;

He has ported it to several other systems, including Windows, Linux, OSX, Nintendo DS, PSP, and GP2X. As of the writing of this article, it is in version 112.</p><p style="">The game itself departs from the standard Rogue-likes in a few ways, some due to memory restrictions, some for ease of control, and some for enhancing the pick-up nature of the game. It adheres to many of the main tenets, however, of <a href="/randomly-generated-maps/3015-206/" data-ref-id="3015-206">randomly generated levels</a>, <a href="/permanent-death/3015-431/" data-ref-id="3015-431">perma-death</a>, self-destructing saved games, complex object interactions combined with a large number of different objects, a potentially-sophisticated series of actions for identifying magical items, high difficulty, tile-based movement, a <a href="/turn-based/3015-192/" data-ref-id="3015-192">turn-based</a> system, and combat that emphasizes tactical play.</p><p style="">One of the main boons of POWDER in particular is that it was built from the ground up to support hand-held systems, and as such, it is ideal for taking with you on the road. You would be surprised to find how many extra minutes you can cram into playing this game, especially as you can save at any point and can usually pick up where you left off no matter how long it has been between sessions. The controls are comparatively simple, as the game auto-prompts you to interact with most things such as stairs and objects instead of requiring you to find the correct keyboard key, and buttons can be easily re-mapped in-game to suit your playing style.</p><p style=""> </p><h2>Story</h2><p style="">Well, the story is primarily an excuse to have a game. You are an aspiring adventurer, and you have decided that you want to win glory and fame. To that purpose, you have entered the dungeon containing Baezl'bub, or "He Who The Author Cannot Spell Consistently". Your mission is to slay him and bring his black heart to the surface as a trophy. That's it, huzzah.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/36051/1194170-startingchar.png" data-ref-id="1300-1194170" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.74755381604697" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:74.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/36051/1194170-startingchar.png" data-ref-id="1300-1194170"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/36051/1194170-startingchar.png"></a><figcaption> The game screen </figcaption></figure><p style="">POWDER is a turn-based RPG with movement based on square tiles. You move around each level of the dungeon, exploring tunnels and rooms, fighting monsters, gathering equipment, and leveling once you have gathered enough experience. Each time you gain a level, you can select from a list of classes determined by which patron deities like you enough, or you can forgo deities entirely and simply level as an adventurer. You receive skills and spells from your deity or from books found around the dungeon, up to a maximum determined by your physical or mental levels, which in turn are determined by which class you level as. Each deity prefers to see certain actions performed, and dislikes others; if they like you (or hate you) enough, they may grant you a miracle (or a smiting). These miracles range from healing you when you are injured to enchanting your weapons or simply granting you XP. Smitings come in the form of such actions as spontaneous immolation, cursing your equipment, polymorphing you into a ridiculously weak creature, and temporarily causing your mana to drain for a period of time.</p><p style="">All of the equipment you pick up starts in an unidentified state, and certain specific items have randomly determined magical properties. Leather sandals, for example, may have a 1 or -1 bonus applied to them or be cursed or blessed, and you will not know until you either identify them through a spell, scroll, or potion, or wear them for a while. Winged boots, on the other hand, may be boots of speed, boots of water-walking, or a few other specific shoe enchantments, in addition to the potential bonus and cursed/holy state. This is determined at the beginning of each new game, requiring you to identify which type of magical item has what enchantment on it every time you have a new adventurer, and that will be quite often.</p><p style="">This brings to light another part of the game: permanent death. You only get one shot at the dungeon with each adventurer. When you save, the game ends, and when you load, the save marks itself as loaded from, and if you load it again (known as 'save scumming') you are not eligible for placement in the high scores. This encourages highly cautious play, amassing equipment to deal with every possible situation and fleeing from those threats you cannot yet handle.</p><p style="">Enemies are spawned randomly from a weighted and limited set of 'at-level' monsters, determined by the player's level and the level of the dungeon you are currently on. Occasionally you get an 'out-of-depth' monster of significantly higher threat than others, which it is generally advisable to run from. Typically this occurs due to a polymorphed monster or a specific room being placed on the map (of which there are several). The types of monsters are typical fantasy fare - dragons, giant rats, golems, et cetera - with some interesting exceptions, such as the lux, an animated desk lamp that blinds its opponents.</p><p style="">The levels themselves, though randomly generated, follow particular patterns; the first several are square rooms linked by dark tunnels, just below which are a handful of labyrinth-like stone-walled levels, lit at first and then pitch-dark as you descend further. Near the bottom of the 30-floor dungeon are what are known as the 'god rooms', with a few of the deities represented by themed rooms. The patron deity of warriors, for example, has a multi-room arena where you must defeat each monster to progress to the next room.</p><p style="">Survival depends heavily on your gear. You can equip a helm, an amulet, body armor, boots, two rings, and one item for each hand, whether it be a shield, weapon, staff, or even a book if you so desire. Rings, scrolls, potions, wands and amulets are all magical and are unidentified at the beginning of the game, though careful testing can determine some of the potential effects. A ring of light, for example, will light the area around it if dropped on the floor, and if you zap a wand at a monster, most of the potential effects will be immediately apparent. A wand of slowness will give an appropriate message when you slow down the affected monster, and a wand of polymorph will immediately change it to another type of monster (which is why <i>careful </i>testing is a good idea). In such situations the wand is immediately renamed to reflect that you know what type it is, and all future wands of that type will be pre-identified. This ID game can be bypassed completely with such things as the spell Identify.</p><p style="">In addition to the standard magical items are 'randart' items, or random artifacts. These are distinguished by a gold cross in the corner of the icon as well as a random name appended to the item. These can have any intrinsic effect possible, including effects not normally accessible such as 'breathless', and unfortunately, 'bleeding'. Frequently, an undesirable effect is paired with the item being cursed, which prevents you from removing the item unless you somehow uncurse it or destroy it. However, beneficial randart items, and especially weapons, typically play a large part in a successful descent and subsequent ascension. Although rare, you can expect to find a small handful of them by the time you reach the bottom.</p><p style="">There are also a few 'crafted' item types, weapons which can be created by the player which have added elemental damage or other benefits, as well as sets of equipment that will grant a particular bonus.</p><h2>Classes and Gods</h2><p style="">When you gain 1000 XP, you gain a level. The <a href="/classes/3015-405/" data-ref-id="3015-405">classes </a>you are permitted to chose from are determined by what deities like you enough - a value you can see when you use the 'pray' command. The physical and mental stats are not translated directly into an increase in max <a href="/hit-points/3015-400/" data-ref-id="3015-400">hit points </a>or magic points; instead, they represent the maximum potential points gained. Following Belweir, for example, may grant you an extra 15 max magic points, but it is more likely to receive fewer. For every 10 points in physical or mental stats you receive, you can learn one additional skill or spell, respectively. The classes, their associated deities, the classes of skills or spells and the physical/mental levels gained are as follows. Physical and mental levels are listed as physical/ mental.</p><ul><li>Adventurer: This is what you take if you don't like the gods. You will not receive blessings, but neither will you receive smitings. Adventurers must learn all their skills and spells from books. They receive 5/ 5 per level.</li><li>Fighter: For the sophisticated fighter who doesn't want to eschew magic entirely. Klaskov is the patron deity of fighters, and he likes to see you slay your foes. He dislikes spellcasting, but won't be too upset about the Klaskovite who throws the occasional spell. All weapon and armor skills can be learned by leveling as a fighter. Followers receive 15/ 0 per level, which means if you want more than one spell, you'll have to find some other way to gain magic points.</li><li>Wizard: The glass cannon of POWDER. Although you will quickly gain a sizable arsenal of spells as a wizard, the utter lack of physical stats make it very difficult to make it through the dungeon as a pure wizard. Belweir is the patron deity, and he likes spellcasting and identifying items. He doesn't like melee. You only learn spells from Belweir, but all of the attack and utility spells are available from him. If you find that your spells are spread across too many different categories, make use of the 'forget' command and grab a spell book. Followers receive 0/ 15 per level; most wizards take a couple levels in fighter or something similar to ensure the possibility of surviving a fireball to the face in the upper dungeon levels.</li><li>Rogue: An interesting class, granting both physical and mental stats. Quizar, the patron deity of rogues, likes ranged attacks, identifying items, finding hidden doors and traps, and killing the helpless. He dislikes loud noises, so wear soft shoes and avoid plate mail. The skills he teaches are primarily involving traps and dual-wielding, so you'll likely need to pick up weapon and armor skills on your own. He'll teach you spells as well, on occasion, without any major focus on a particular school. Followers receive 10/ 5 per level.</li><li>Necromancer: This class focuses on making lots of cannon fodder and throwing them at anything you come across. It's a difficult class to play, as you need to keep an eye on your minions and hunger becomes something of an issue when you're converting corpses to undead. The Arch-Lich Tlosh is the patron deity, though he is a mortal who has raised himself to godlike power and immortality. He likes ranged killing and death magic, as well as killing the helpless, and dislikes melee combat and healing. He <i>hates</i> healing spells especially, and will smite any follower who casts one immediately. The spells he teaches are primarily necromancy, which can seem limiting until the later spells come into play - a particularly devastating set of spells, only increasing in lethality as you learn more of them. Followers gain 5/ 10 per level, making them less fragile than wizards.</li><li>Barbarian: Wade into melee and crush your enemies. This is the call of the barbarian, and the joy of their patron deity, H'ruth. Perhaps the easiest class to play, thanks to the quick rise in hit points and the lack of having to pick through spells to learn. Levelling in barbarian will teach you how to eat well in the dungeon, and give you some weapon skills as well, though several of the physical skills are out of his domain. Bearing that in mind, collecting the right skill books will make you a juggernaut. H'ruth likes seeing you surrounded by enemies and slaughtering your opponents, though he dislikes ranged attacks and will instantly smite a follower who casts any spell whatsoever. Followers gain a whopping 20/ 0.</li><li>Cleric: Perhaps the most challenging of classes to stick with, aside from going pure wizard. Significant amounts of healing and the potential for a powerful ally or two make it an interesting choice, however. The cleric has to maintain an unsteady balance between hit points, magic points, and hunger, though the last is helped significantly if you can learn the skill Endure Hunger. Pax, the patron deity, likes his followers to heal and smite the undead, but he has some stringent requirements: he doesn't like it when you initiate combat, eat when not hungry, and strike the helpless, and will smite the follower who attacks allies or casts death magic. Those who survive their first few levels rapidly gain strength though, as they gain 10/ 10 per level. On the gripping hand, it's difficult to gain those first few levels, as you have to cast enough healing spells to gain favor with Pax and you need to let everything hit you first before you pound on it. Keeping the other gods happy enough to protect you from the combined fury of Tlosh and H'ruth is highly suggested - they are perfectly capable of killing you with a string of ill-timed curses.</li><li>Cultist: The most random of classes, following the most random of deities. &gt;&lt;0|V|, as he is called, is fickle and whimsical, and will on occasion throw a wrench in the adventurer's gears simply for his own amusement. If you follow him, he will occasionally inform you of his mood, from which you must determine which of the gods' edicts you must adhere to in order to gain favor with him. Until he changes his mind again. You can learn any and all skills and spells from him, but the physical and mental levels he grants are completely random each time you level as a cultist. If you're lucky, you can become a phenomenally powerful adventurer in a short amount of time, or alternately, you could be a pitiful little wuss in a dungeon full of scary things. So it goes for the cultist. Followers of other deities tend to have a strong distaste for &gt;&lt;0|V|, as he will sometimes find you very amusing for a while until he decides that he doesn't like your spellcasting, and smite you for it after considering you a 'follower' for a while.</li></ul><p style="">The first several times you play the game, you are given a random set of equipment consisting of a weapon, armor, a spell book, a skill book, and one random item. These are pre-identified as you are considered to have brought them with you from above-ground. After ten games, however, you are permitted to select from a class when you start and your equipment is better tailored to your choice. (Picking &gt;&lt;0|V| at the beginning lets you hear his moods.)</p><h2>Evolution</h2><p style="">As a homebrew game, the author is continually adding features and fixing bugs, making the gameplay subtly different each time a new release comes out.

As a result, it will attempt to bridge the gap between the two, giving players more backstory about how the digital world and game grid of 1982 has become a much more dangerous (and graphically superior) world by 2010.</p><p style=""> </p><p style="">In Tron: Evolution, "Tron" is both the name of a <a href="/tron-city/3035-3455/" data-ref-id="3035-3455"> city</a> and a <a href="/tron/3005-5152/" data-ref-id="3005-5152"> character</a>; Alan Bradley's messianic security program that started it all. The city is getting overrun by a computer virus known as <a href="/abraxas/3005-16540/" data-ref-id="3005-16540"> Abraxas</a>, and you'll be fighting a number of programs (read: dudes) who have been infected with the virus as you play. The different factions of the Tron universe continue to battle, and new factions have also risen, denoted by their colors. These will factor into the story, though it's currently unknown where all of the characters' allegiances lie.</p><p style=""> </p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/95284/1555444-14772multiplayer_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1555444" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.45283018867925" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:45.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/95284/1555444-14772multiplayer_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1555444"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/95284/1555444-14772multiplayer_06.jpg"></a><figcaption>Battling on the Game Grid </figcaption></figure><p style="">The primary gameplay in Evolution is focused on combat and acrobatics, with the former resembling the type of light attack/heavy attack/grab action that has become relatively commonplace in the post-<a href="/god-of-war/3025-244/" data-ref-id="3025-244"> <i>God of War</i></a> era. The player movement includes wall runs, big jumps, the ability to vault off of specific targets, and so on, giving the moment to moment movement a feel that mirrors the modern <a href="/prince-of-persia/3025-431/" data-ref-id="3025-431"> Prince of Persia</a> games. As is standard in the world of Tron, the player character wield a disc that is used for combat purposes. It can be thrown like a boomerang, you can lock onto enemies to nail them from a distance, and you can also take aimed shots with it.</p><h3>Movement</h3><p style="">The player character's movement takes multiple cues from different games such as Assassin's Creed, Mirror's Edge and God of War. Moving about the environment is done primarily via wall runs and jumps.</p><p style="">The player can jump and sprint. The sprint button opens up multiple opportunities like in Assassin's Creed. You can wall run, wall jump and run up walls. Jumping before running up a wall lets you run higher up it. The character can jump off low surfaces or ramps to propel himself over long gaps. The character can also grab ledges and shimmy on ledges. Jumping up from these ledges allows for a higher jump. At the beginning of the game, the player gets the Navi Bit from Quorr. This object lets the player propel himself from orange grappel points. The player can chain multiple grapple points thanks to the game's targeting system.</p><p style="">The game gives the player a pretty straight forward path that he can follow. Critical paths usually have a colored light source on theme, telling the player where to wall jump or where to aim a jump. The Navi Bit also comes in handy to find your way but only in Tron City.</p><h3>Combat</h3><p style="">Combat is disc based where the player faces enemies who also have discs (except when facing the infected enemies). The combat is done acrobatically. The player is recommended to jump off the walls and benches to become a harder target and not get hit. The player fights with both melee attacks and ranged attacks with the light disc. He can also block and parry.</p><p style="">The player has both a health and energy bar that he can upgrade at disc stations scattered through the game world. The game ends when the player's health runs out (the game over screen is a blank, dark computer screen that indicates that a backup is being prepared). The energy bar is divided into six bars. Each bar runs out after the player uses a special disc attack and bars can be replenished after defeating enemies. Health and energy are replenished thanks to objects in the environment. Green or white pieces of wall replenish the player's health when he runs over them. Computers and other objects can serve as a power source to gain more power.</p><p style="">During the course of the game, the player gains four different light discs :</p><h4>Heavy Disc</h4><p style="">The first disc the player gets. It's not very mobile but powerful. It hits specific enemies hard and with rang. It posesses three special attacks. The first attack fires the charged disc at the enemy. The second attack is a ground slam that gets multiple enemies at ones and sends them flying into the air. The third attack is a mobile attack where multiple light discs come out of the player at once.</p><h4>Bomb Disc</h4><p style="">The bomb disc is very mobile but less precise. It possesses three special attacks and when it is equipped, enemies get shocked each time they inflict damage to the player. The first is a bomb attack that targets one enemy but detonates and destroys enemies around the target. The second attack is a ground slam type explosion that derezzes all enemies around the player. The final attack has the player throwing multiple grenades around him.</p><h4>Stasis Disc</h4><p style="">The Stasis Disc serves more as a way to a means. It's used to send enemies flying and make them float in the air. This is an ideal way to defeat enemies with other discs. If the player stands still when this disc is equipped, the player becomes invisible. This disc has two special attacks. The first attack targets one enemy, sending him into stasis. The second attack is a ground slam area attack that sends multiple enemies into stasis.</p><h4>Corruption Disc</h4><p style="">This disc is both harmful to the player as well as to the player. It corrupts other enemies, turning them into a walking time bomb and turning off all their weapons. Like the other discs, one special attack targets a particular enemy while the other is an area attack that can corrupt the player himself.</p><h3>Enemies</h3><h4>Infected</h4><p style="">The first enemy that the player faces. They are very basic, infected programs that just run towards the player, flailing their arms.</p><h4>Disc Soldier</h4><p style="">Regular enemy who just throws his disc. He is vulnerable to all attacks.</p><h4>Stasis Soldier</h4><p style="">This pesky foe is extremely agile. He dodges most attacks, including the most powerful ones. He has a powerful disc-based attack and when the player gets to close, triggers a stasis attack that throws the player into the air and leaves him temporarily floating in the air. His weakness are counter attacks that destroys half of his health and leaves him vulnerable on the ground.</p><h4>Shield Soldier</h4><p style="">This soldier has a giant shield that blocks almost every attack. He also has a powerful, disc based attack. His only weakness comes from the very ground he's standing on. A powerful, ground slam from the player's heavy disc is enough to knock him off his feat. Once he's on the ground, he's exposed to all attacks thrown at him.</p><h4>Heavy Soldier</h4><p style="">This powerful soldier has a powerful ground slam and has almost no weaknesses. He resists to almost all special attacks including stasis which only slows his slam. He's only at a disadvantage while he's doing his ground slam. He also dislikes the effects of the Corruption Disc.</p><h4>Special Infected</h4><p style="">These type of infected have the same attacks as the regular ones but are no push overs. They are very tough and must be destroyed in two steps. First, they must be stunned by a stasis attack that keeps them floating in the air for several seconds, this is the ideal time to strike. Here, he is vulnerable to all types of attacks.</p><h4>The Black Guard</h4><p style="">The most powerful enemies in the game, they have no weakness. They are Clu's personal guard and they come in two forms: Staff Guards and Grenade Guards. The Staff Guards block literally all basic attacks. They have one deadly attack routine that ends with them slamming their staff. The Grenade Guards throw multiple grenades at once while jumping off the walls. They can be hit by any type of attack but this does little to no damage.</p><h3>Light Cycles</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1379154-tron_evolution_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1379154" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1379154-tron_evolution_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1379154"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1379154-tron_evolution_06.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1379154-tron_evolution_06.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">The iconic light cycles from the first film return in Tron: Evolution in a new, decidedly more analog form. No longer are the bikes limited to 90-degree turns as you can steer them around as you would in a normal racing game. The first gameplay sequence shown involving the bikes has the player racing along a constantly exploding roadway that is being attacked by Recognizers. You can throw discs while riding the bike, giving you a chance to take out enemy light cycles along the way.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style="">Set between the events of the <i>Tron </i>and <i>Tron: Legacy </i>films (though closer to the latter than the former), the game begins with a young <a href="/kevin-flynn/3005-17245/" data-ref-id="3005-17245"> Kevin Flynn</a> creating a video diary. He explains that the closed computer system he created has begun to evolve on its own. Self-aware programs known as "ISOs" (Isomorphic Algorithms) have been mysteriously appearing in the system, having no user or programmed function. They exhibit free will and, despite being a peaceful race, are generally disliked and distrusted among the traditionally created sentient programs, now known as "Basics". It is explained that Jalen, one of the leaders of the ISOs, was de-rezzed on the Game Grid, which was re-purposed for entertainment purposes instead of the bloodsport that the Master Control Program used them for. Flynn suspects that Jalen was murdered. Flynn’s system administrator, <a href="/clu/3005-17127/" data-ref-id="3005-17127"> Clu-2</a>, also behaves suspiciously around the ISOs, so Flynn has created a new system monitor, a mute program named <a href="/anon/3005-17407/" data-ref-id="3005-17407"> Anon</a> (short for "anonymous", a joke on his inability to speak), to get things under control.</p><p style="">Inside the computer world, Radia, leader of the ISOs is being installed as system co-administrator alongside Clu-2. The player takes control of the new, and completely silent, system monitor. Anon quickly meets with <a href="/tron/3005-5152/" data-ref-id="3005-5152"> Tron</a> in Tron City, and Tron instructs Anon to prevent any unauthorized entry into the ceremony. <a href="/quorra/3005-15523/" data-ref-id="3005-15523"> Quorra</a>, a female Basic, attempts unsuccessfully to gain access to Radia. Suspicious, Tron instructs Anon to follow her. Quorra leads him directly to the installation ceremony, already underway.</p><p style="">At the ceremony, Clu-2 expresses hope for a bright future, where Basics and ISOs will live together in peace. Radia takes the podium and explains her sadness at the loss of Jalen, but looks forward to a brighter tomorrow. Suddenly, the ceremony is interrupted by Abraxas, a shadowy</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81887/1659267-quorra_2_450x253.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1659267" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.56222222222222" data-width="450" style="width: 450px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81887/1659267-quorra_2_450x253.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1659267"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/81887/1659267-quorra_2_450x253.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/81887/1659267-quorra_2_450x253.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Quorra and Anon</figcaption></figure><p style="">yellow virus seemingly bent on de-rezzing Clu-2, and who dispatches the ceremonial guards with little effort. Anon saves Clu-2 and fights off Abraxas, who escapes to continue spreading corruption throughout the system.</p><p style="">Flynn and Tron arrive. Clu-2 comments that a virus shouldn’t be possible in the sealed system, but it exists nonetheless; his theory is that Abraxas was once an ISO, whose self-evolving programing took a dark turn somewhere along its development. Clu-2 calls the ISOs “flaws,” which Flynn is quick to correct, and laments Clu’s inability to understand the miracle of the ISOs' existence, which he attributes to his own poor programming skills. This visibly angers Clu, though he remains silent. Tron encourages Flynn to leave the system, advising him that it’s no longer safe for him. Anon is instructed to find and eradicate the source of the corruption.</p><p style="">Anon explores the city, destroying corrupted programs wherever he finds them. On his way past the virtual version of Flynn’s Arcade, Anon witnesses Flynn and Tron being ambushed by Clu-2 and his guards. Flynn and Tron are presumed killed and de-rezzed (respectively) in the skirmish, but the Monitor fights off Clu’s soldiers and escapes.</p><p style="">Fighting his way through the Quarantine Zone, Anon meets Quorra. She confesses that she witnessed the ambush and wants to get the truth out about what happened. She suggests visiting Zuse, the popular owner of an ISO-friendly nightclub, for advice.</p><p style="">At the nightclub, Quorra explains the situation to Zuse. Zuse gives Quorra’s identity disc the control codes to the Solar Sailor, and encourages them to travel to Arjia City, birthplace of the ISOs, to find Radia and warn her about Clu, and to have her spread the word among the ISOs. Just then, the nightclub and the skyscraper it sits atop of are attacked by Recognizers. Quorra gives Anon her identity disc and they flee down the side of the crumbling building on Light Cycles.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1379151-tron_evolution_03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1379151" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1379151-tron_evolution_03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1379151"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1379151-tron_evolution_03.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1379151-tron_evolution_03.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Light Cycles remain kickass</figcaption></figure><p style="">Once on ground, Quorra realizes that by attacking one of their only safe havens, Clu-2 has declared open war on the ISOs. The pair is suddenly attacked by one of the guards that de-rezzed Tron, and Anon gives chase. Bombarded by attacks from Clu’s guards and Abraxas alike, Anon eventually commandeers a Light Tank, and blasts his way to the Solar Sailor docks, where he reunites with Quorra.</p><p style="">Arriving in Arjia City, they find screens broadcasting Anon's wanted status, and Quorra suggests that he travel in the city’s cavernous subsystem, rather than on city streets, to the main Hub. Once at the Arjia Communal Assembly, Anon finds Clu’s soldiers invading the city and terrorizing the population. He fights his way to the Hub, where he and Quorra witness Clu-2 meeting with Radia. Clu tells Radia he needs her help to stop the spread of the Abraxas virus, and that Anon killed Flynn. He asks Radia to gather all the ISOs together in an effort to root out the virus.</p><p style="">Once Clu leaves, Quorra and Anon tell Radia the truth, and Radia tells Quorra to warn the other ISO factions. Radia then informs Anon that Flynn was <i>not </i>killed, but was rescued and smuggled from Tron City by an ISO survivalist named Gibson, who was subsequently arrested and taken to the Game Grid, which Clu-2 has changed back to their original function as brutal execution arenas for enemies of the state.</p><p style="">The Monitor escapes Arjia City, infiltrates the Game Grid, and rescues Gibson. In the meantime, Clu-2 publically rallies the Basics against the ISOs, inexplicably determined to eradicate the ISOs from the system entirely. Gibson takes Anon to his home at Bostrom Colony, where Flynn is in hiding. They discover that the corruption has spread there and infected Gibson’s friends. Flynn, in the meantime, has fled and cannot be found.</p><p style="">The primary body of Abraxas arrives, and Anon and Gibson are forced to flee. They discover Flynn’s Light Cycle, abandoned. Gibson recommends that they return to Arjia, hoping Radia will know what to do. Giving chase, Abraxas catches Gibson and infects him. Anon is forced to de-rez Gibson before escaping via Light Cycle to Arjia City, which has come under attack from Clu’s forces. He commandeers another Light Tank and blasts through armies of Recognizers, Light Tanks, and ground forces to Arjia’s Hub.</p><p style="">Arriving at the Hub, the Monitor finds Quorra. She explains that Clu-2 has attacked every ISO enclave in the system before she could get word to them, and that a near-complete <a href="/genocide/3015-3075/" data-ref-id="3015-3075"> genocide</a> has already taken place. Inside the Hub, they discover Clu-2 speaking with a captured Radia. He taunts her with the de-rezzing of every other ISO on the Grid, asking her how it felt. Abraxas then arrives, and asks Radia not to be frightened. Radia realizes that Abraxas is, in fact, Jalen, and that Clu-2 reprogrammed him into the virus to create a pretence for the eradication of the ISO race. Abraxas infects Radia, destroying the last pure ISO in the system. Quorra departs to follow Clu, while Anon stays and defeats Abraxas in single combat. But immediately thereafter, Arjia City is completely destroyed and the Monitor loses consciousness.</p><p style="">Anon wakes up to the sound of Flynn’s voice and discovers that he has been rescued. Flynn expresses deep sadness and dismay over the loss of the ISOs. He then tells Anon that Quorra has snuck aboard Clu’s warship, the Regulator, and that he should rescue her, as she is “more special than [he] know[s]” and is vital to the future of the system. The Monitor leaves and stows away aboard a Recognizer bound for the warship.</p><p style="">After fighting his way through the Regulator, Anon interrupts Clu-2 as about he is about to de-rez Quorra. Clu sends his toughest guards to de-rez the Monitor, but Anon prevails. Just then, a Recognizer carrying Abraxas arrives and crashes into the side of the ship. He explains to Anon that he wants to "die" and end his suffering, but now cannot, and blames Clu. Clu throws Quorra into the fight below and flees. Anon defeats Abraxas once again, destroys the power core, and escapes with Quorra on a passing Recognizer as the Regulator explodes behind them. The shockwave causes them to lose control, and the Recognizer plummets to the surface.

Several of your elemental powers allow you to control aspects crucial in puzzle solving. For example, <a href="/the-prince/3005-2623/" data-ref-id="3005-2623">the Prince</a> is able to perform an air dash, allowing him to cross long distances. His ability to stop water from flowing allows him to traverse it in unique ways.</p><p style="">For the Wii version the game concentrates on small groups of enemies that are more vicious and attack more frequently, creating an atmosphere more akin to the previous Prince of Persia games than the other version of The Forgotten Sands. While in combat, the Prince makes use of his blade with the Wii Remote and hands through the use of the Nunchuk. All of the other moves that the Prince uses for are controlled through the buttons. There are no elemental powers that the Prince can use for this version for the game. Instead the Prince uses an object called the "Sand Ring" which freezes enemies in their place for a limited amount of time.</p><p style="">A brand new combat system has been designed, which is said to benefit from the <a href="/anvil-game-engine/3015-3972/" data-ref-id="3015-3972">Anvil engine</a>'s capability to show countless <a href="/non-player-character/3015-967/" data-ref-id="3015-967">NPCs</a> at once on the screen, displaying as many as 50 enemies at once on the screen.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p style="">The Forgotten Sands ignores the <a href="/prince-of-persia/3030-20961/" data-ref-id="3030-20961">2008 reboot</a> of the franchise and returns to the concluded <a href="/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time/3030-5235/" data-ref-id="3030-5235">Sands of Time</a> trilogy of games' story and universe. </p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1218771-popfs_palace_exterior.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1218771" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.56142584341184" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1218771-popfs_palace_exterior.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1218771"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/30/1218771-popfs_palace_exterior.jpg"></a><figcaption>The Prince will be visiting his brothers Royal Palace.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The game for the 360, PS3, and PC versions takes place between <a href="/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time/3030-5235/" data-ref-id="3030-5235">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> and <a href="/prince-of-persia-warrior-within/3030-17357/" data-ref-id="3030-17357">Prince of Persia: Warrior Within</a>, giving insight on how <a href="/the-prince/3005-2623/" data-ref-id="3005-2623">the Prince</a> turned from a charming young rogue to an emotionally unstable murderer.</p><h3>PC, PS3 X360</h3><p style="">Prince visits his brother Malik's kingdom, only to discover it under attack. Malik released the solomon's Army to fight the invaders but the army turns against everyone. Prince finds an ally in Razia, a genie. Prince fights his way to the leader of the Solomon's Army, a Ifrit named Ratash. But The Ratash takes over his brother, and Prince has to find him again. Razia helps Prince to find a sword forged by genies, to defeat Ratash, she even sacrifices her body to merge with the sword. Eventually in a big sand storm Prince and Ratash have a final clash, and the Prince kills him.</p><h3>Wii</h3><p style="">The Wii version takes place with the Prince being lead by the Genie Zahra, who is making claims that she can give the Prince a kingdom and princess if he follows her. Once they arrive to the spot where the kingdom was to be, the Prince sees nothing and feels cheated. Zahra tells him to kiss a statue in the middle of the clearing and once he does, he is able to see what Zahra sees, which is the kingdom of Izdihar. The Prince soon realizes that the kingdom is in poor condition, but manages to find a sword stuck in stone. After pulling it out, he accidentally frees a women and a beast named Haoma. While searching for the beast, Zahra tells the Prince that the genies once lived in Izdihar, but were all killed by the Haoma. In effect, the Wii version is a prequel to the other console versions because as the Prince leaves the ruins of Izdihar, he heads to his brother's kingdom to begin the next part of the Forgotten Sands storyline.</p><h3>PSP</h3><p style="">Princes are being killed, and Prince of Persia is guarded in his home. But he follows a mysterious voice to confront the one who wants to harm him. The helper is Helem, one of the sisters of time. She asks Prince to release her three sisters, to weaken the culprit, fire spirit Ahihud. Prince travels through Ethereal World to help the sisters of time and confronts Ahihud in the end.</p><h3>NDS</h3><p style="">Nintendo DS takes place after all of the other Forgotten Sands games. Prince and Razia are kidnapped by a cult that takes Razia's powers and Prince's blood and his memories. In a quest to regain his memories from the cult members, he discovers that the cult used the ritual to resurrect their Master. After regaining his memories he defeats the Master. And the sword that Razia inhabited turned to sand.</p><p style="">Although its release window deliberately coincides with the release of the <a href="http://www.screened.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time/16-114109/" rel="nofollow"><i>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</i></a> movie, the storyline of <i>The Forgotten Sands</i> has nothing to do with that of the film.</p><h2>Various Versions</h2><p style="">The <a href="/playstation-3/3055-1463/" data-ref-id="3055-1463">PS3</a>, <a href="/xbox-360/3045-20/" data-ref-id="3045-20">Xbox 360</a>, and <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC</a> versions of the game were developed by <a href="/ubisoft-montreal-studios/3010-1559/" data-ref-id="3010-1559">Ubisoft Montreal</a> and offer a traditional <a href="/prince-of-persia/3025-431/" data-ref-id="3025-431">Prince of Persia</a> experience, using the technology that powered the <a href="/prince-of-persia/3030-20961/" data-ref-id="3030-20961">2008 game</a> and the <a href="/assassins-creed/3025-38/" data-ref-id="3025-38">Assassin's Creed</a> series of games.</p><p style="">The <a href="/nintendo-ds/3045-52/" data-ref-id="3045-52">DS</a>, <a href="/psp/3045-18/" data-ref-id="3045-18">PSP</a>,and <a href="/wii/3045-36/" data-ref-id="3045-36">Wii</a> versions of the game were <a href="/ubisoft-quebec-city-studio/3010-3831/" data-ref-id="3010-3831">Ubisoft Quebec City</a>, and offer a "different experience from the more powerful systems."

of Honor series; the game features separately-developed single player and multiplayer modes.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Medal of Honor focuses on the 2001 invasion of <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/afghanistan/3035-1017/" data-ref-id="3035-1017">Afghanistan</a>, referred to as "Operation Enduring Freedom", as the US led invasion forces fight <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/taliban/3015-6215/" data-ref-id="3015-6215">Taliban</a> insurgents. In campaign the player will control several <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/tier-1-operator/3015-4420/" data-ref-id="3015-4420">Tier 1 Operators</a>, that liken themselves as the "scalpel" of the U.S. war machine, whose missions favor restraint and require discretion. Also playable in the single player are <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/united-states-army/3015-5271/" data-ref-id="3015-5271">U.S. Army</a> Rangers, the "hammer" of U.S. coalition forces. Multiplayer features standard deathmatch, as well as objective based modes, where players can select from multiple classes including special ops, assault and recon specialists.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/23298/1560311-1559034_300px_anaconda_helicopter_super.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1560311" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.65666666666667" data-width="300" style="width: 300px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:65.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/23298/1560311-1559034_300px_anaconda_helicopter_super.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1560311"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/23298/1560311-1559034_300px_anaconda_helicopter_super.jpg"></a><figcaption>Actual US troops deployed in the Shah-i-Kot valley.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The game centres around one particular battle: the Battle of Shah-i-Kot. This battle was part of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Anaconda" rel="nofollow">Operation Anaconda</a>. This large scale operation had as a goal to root out Taliban forces hiding in the surrounding mountains. The operation was lead from March 1, 2002 until March 19, 2002. The American lead coalition succeeded in hunting the Taliban out of the region and as the game indicates, the Taliban numbers were estimated to be up to 1,000 troops strong. The operation involved both US and Afghan forces, like in the game, and the Taliban suffered losses of about 500 causalities which is probably the body count the player will find themselves with by the end of the game. Of course, the Generals and Colonels leading the operation don't have the same names as the ones who lead the actual operation (Anaconda was lead in real life by LTG. Franklin L. Hagenbeck).</p><p style="">In the game, the player is tasked with capturing the Bagram Airfield. This airfield really exists and has been under US control since December 2001. This airfield is extremely important as it houses part of the US Marines and air forces in Afghanistan. It's also one of the few airfields in Afghanistan where Air Force One is authorized to land.</p><p style="">The Tier 1 operators that the player play as did not exist even though certain team mates of the player00 such as Dusty have existed in the past. One of Medal of Honor's main protagonists, pictured on the box art, is rumored to be a real veteran of the current war in Afghanistan. He is currently referred to as a "Tier 1 Operator," nicknamed "Cowboy", and works for the National Command Authority. These operators are part of the United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group. Tier 1 operators are trained in counter terrorism and can only be deployed by the President or the Defense Secretary. The game also has players controlling Tier 2 operatives (US Army Rangers) and Tier 3 operatives (10th Mountain Division).</p><h2>Story</h2><p style="">The game starts as US Army Rangers are in the back of a helicopter, flying over a snowy valley. A man who seems to be the commanding officer jumps out of the helicopter first. Just when his feet brutally hit the ground, rockets fly everywhere and hit the helicopter, blacking the player out.</p><p style="">The game flashes back 6 weeks. As the opening credits roll, the camera pans around Earth. During this sequence, the story manages to explain why the U.S. are in Afghanistan without ever using the phrase "9/11". Players hear news broadcasts including which say the words "beautiful morning in NYC", "live from downtown New York", "Dark smoke coming from the Pentagon". Players also hear the military talking about the Taliban and how they're playing planing something big, which has been referred to as the "wedding". The camera zooms in onto Afghanistan and gives a birds eye view of Afghanistan land through a <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/unmanned-aerial-vehicle/3055-3350/" data-ref-id="3055-3350">UAV</a> drone.</p><p style="">The camera descends into the perspective of Rabbit, a Tier 1 soldier part of AFO Neptune. He's riding in white trucks with the three other soldiers of his squad (Mother, Voodoo, Preacher) towards the village of Gardez. They're tasked with meeting with an informant called Tariq. Tariq has told his militia friends that Neptune was coming which facilitates their entry into the town. The militia tells the squad that the Taliban have apparently left the town so there's no need to worry. Despite this fact, the squad is still on edge. They arrive on a street where the garbage cans are on fire and a truck blocks their passage. Suddenly, Chechen terrorists appear. A rocket hits the truck in front of Rabbit; Voodoo puts the truck in reverse and drives it right through a building. The two soldiers make their way by foot to meet up with the two other squad mates, Mother and Preacher who've survived despite their truck blowing up.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11660/1554368-moh_screen_07.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1554368" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11660/1554368-moh_screen_07.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1554368"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11660/1554368-moh_screen_07.jpg"></a><figcaption>Neptune getting it done.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The squad manages to "link up" and deduce that Tariq has ratted them out since the Taliban was waiting for them. They still decide to fight their way to the house where the rendezvous was planned. They go to the second floor where a dead, brutally wounded man sits tied to an office chair. Neptune first think this is Tariq but realize that it is not. Suddenly they begin to hear beeping coming from inside the body and realize that the body is booby trapped. Mother kicks the chair back onto the balcony where the body blows up taking out the front of the house. Neptune radios Command asking them where Tariq is; Command replies by saying that a <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/central-intelligence-agency/3015-2988/" data-ref-id="3015-2988">CIA</a> drone may have found him in a nearby fort.</p><p style="">Neptune arrives at the fort and discovers that it's not only heavily guarded but also inaccessible due to a huge front gate. Command sends a predator missile, making the squad experience danger close, and Neptune enters the fort, killing Taliban. They search every room of the fort for Tariq and eventually find him being held at gun point. They take care of his captors and go to a rendezvous point to hand him off to the CIA. Tariq tells the squad that they must counter attack Al Qaeda and the Taliban. According to him, the Taliban have a large contingency of soldiers and weapons in Shah-i-Kot valley. Once again, this proves that intel was wrong.</p><p style="">AFO Neptune and a squad of local soldiers are tasked with taking an airfield in Bagram. This heavily protected airfield eventually falls and becomes a forward operating base for US forces. The base is under the control of colonel Drucker. Drucker's superior is General Flagg. Flagg is a stereotype of certain American generals while Drucker shows a much more patriotic type of America. Flagg is actually in the US with a nice office with a nice view that looks on some nice looking palm trees. Drucker on the other hand is neck deep in Afghan territory. They have very conflicting views. Drucker wants the AFO to go on recon and the Afghan army to eliminate the army, limiting American losses and letting the Afghans win their war. Flagg wants to deploy different army divisions and the Rangers to go and kill the Taliban in the mountains. Drucker proves that what the general is asking is dumb but Flagg gives Drucker 24 hours to do what he said or else.</p><p style="">The player then takes control of AFO Wolfpack. Players control Deuce while the other team mates go by the names of Dusty, Panther and Vegas. Deuce and Dusty ride on quad bikes and spot Taliban convoys in the area. They soon discover that these convoys are actually full of weapons and go on a stealth mission to mark them all with a beacon so allied forces can take them out. The action switches back to Rabbit who paints the convoys for US missiles to destroy. At the same time, Drucker has inserted Afghan forces to go hunting for the Taliban. Flagg calls in a rage. At the same time, AFO Wolfpack approach a column of unknown vehicles. Flagg being intensely angry with Drucker orders an AC-130 strike on said vehicles. The vehicles were actually those of the Afghan army and of the US and friendly fire ensues leading the Afghans to retreat. Drucker having lost the Afghans has no other choice but to call in the Rangers.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/112064/1556893-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-1556893" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/112064/1556893-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-1556893"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/112064/1556893-1.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/112064/1556893-1.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Landing</figcaption></figure><p style="">The Rangers are called in and are all super pumped. They land in a valley and first think that there is no enemy. Suddenly, they find themselves under heavy weapons fire and rockets fly through the air, shooting down US helicopters. Bodies drop but the squad manages to make it out safe. Players control Specialist Dante Adams; him and his squad are tasked in destroying the Taliban's heavy machine guns that are raining death onto the valley. Players eventually destroy the machine guns thanks to a Predator missile and traverse down towards a small village to get picked up. The village seems calm. One of the squad mates approaches a door and just when he utters the words "cellphone" the house blows up. The squad manages to recover, but Taliban start running down the hills in all directions. The Rangers try to take cover behind rubble but there are just too many bad guys. They call in for air support but realize that none is in the area. They also realize that they have no more ammo. The Rangers call off air support since they won't be able to survive long enough for it to arrive and wish Command "Good Luck". Just as they're about to be overrun, Apache helicopters appear and narrowly save the lucky Rangers.</p><p style="">Players take control of the Apaches as they shoot up the neighboring mountains and Taliban bases. After eliminating an entire village, the Apaches are about to go home when an AAA gun suddenly appears. Right before the helicopters are blown to pieces, the Taliban manning the AAA gun is shot in the head. The shot came from Deuce and Dusty who are on the opposite mountain. They're sniping nearby Taliban and are in contact with Neptune who are on the opposite mountain. Neptune lures the Taliban into Wolfpack's line of fire, killing the insurgents. Eventually, the Taliban are too numerous and Neptune is forced to retreat over the mountain ridge.</p><p style="">Players take control once again of Rabbit. Neptune makes a run down the mountain to escape the Taliban. They make it to the LZ but due to RPG fire it gets too hot and the Chinook leaves without Preacher and Voodoo. Mother and Rabbit promise to come back for them since their helicopter has been hit and must return to base. Mother mounts an operation and returns into the mountains at night to look for the two lost squad members. Their helicopter is attacked and Rabbit and Mother are forced to jump. They get separated but eventually meet up. However they seize the attention of the Taliban and end up being chased by them. They lock themselves up in a hut that is destroyed by an RPG. Mother drags a wounded Rabbit who manages to get up but who is combat inefficient. The two Americans get cornered at the edge of a cliff and decide to jump. They land many meters later and fall into the hands of the Taliban.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/112064/1557110-3.png" data-ref-id="1300-1557110" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/112064/1557110-3.png" data-ref-id="1300-1557110"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/112064/1557110-3.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/112064/1557110-3.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Command</figcaption></figure><p style="">Drucker manages locate the two captured soldiers and wants to send a team to save them. Flagg disagrees with this and doesn't want to risk anymore losses. Flagg and Drucker get into an argument to the point where the colonel decides to disobey orders and cuts communications with Flagg. An AC-130 is in the area and the only way to know which ones are Mother and Rabbit is to send a single missile near the group of Taliban. The ones who don't run away are the two prisoners. Drucker sends in a special team to go save the two soldiers.</p><p style="">The Chinook in which the rescue team is flying is shot down. The game shows Players what a helicopter crash looks like from inside of a helicopter, where bodies bounce around in slow motion while enemy bullets tear through its armor with ease. After this spectacular crash, the squad goes through many Taliban before finding Voodoo and Preacher. After more looking and with the help of a CIA Predator drone they find Mother and Rabbit. The player's point of view changes to Rabbit's as he tries to stay alive despite his wounds. His team mates try to reassure him but sadly there is no air support in the area to pick up Rabbit.</p><p style="">Rabbit dies of his wounds and the rest of the team is evacuated via Chinook. Body bags line the corridor of the Chinook as jets can be seen destroying what is left of the Afghan camp. Voodoo states that "this is not how it ends" and the screen fades to black. A message appears, honouring the soldiers fighting to keep freedom alive. Then, "The Catalyst" from Linkin Park plays.</p><p style="">The credits shortly cut to show two men dressed in typical Middle Eastern clothes enjoying a cup of tea in a bustling Middle Eastern city. Suddenly, they see a man they were looking out for, they get up and the credits resume.</p><h2>Missions</h2><h3>Prologue</h3><ul><li>Mission 01: <b>First In</b></li><li>Mission 02: <b>Breaking Bagram</b></li></ul><h3>Day 1</h3><ul><li>Mission 03: <b>Running with Wolves…</b></li><li>Mission 04: <b>Dorothy’s a Bitch</b></li><li>Mission 05: <b>Belly of the Beast</b></li><li>Mission 06: <b>Gunfighters</b></li><li>Mission 07: <b>Friends From Afar</b></li><li>Mission 08: <b>Compromised</b></li></ul><h3>Day 2</h3><ul><li>Mission 09: <b>Neptune’s Net</b></li><li>Mission 10: <b>Rescue the Rescuers</b></li></ul><h2>Development</h2><p style="">The development of <i>Medal of Honor</i> has been split between <a href="/danger-close-games/3010-7208/" data-ref-id="3010-7208">Danger Close Games</a> (<em>EA Los Angeles</em>) and <a href="/dice/3010-4880/" data-ref-id="3010-4880">DICE</a>. Danger Close is assigned to make the single player campaign while DICE will be developing the multiplayer portion of the game. Additionally, DCG is using <a href="/unreal-engine-3/3015-86/" data-ref-id="3015-86">Unreal Engine 3</a> to make the single player campaign, while DICE will employ their own <a href="/frostbite-engine/3015-1095/" data-ref-id="3015-1095">Frostbite Engine</a> to create the multiplayer.

The game is played in first person with the gun being slightly on the right side of the screen. All of the weapons that the player use can be more precise when the player looks down the weapon's iron sights. Some weapons only have iron sights where the player must aim by pointing the weapon at the enemy, look down the sights and place the enemy right above the the middle vertical part of the sight. Some weapons have more precise aiming attachments such as the <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/red-dot-sight/3055-1037/" data-ref-id="3055-1037">red dot</a>. This dot is actual the result of a laser that's pointing out of the weapon and that indicates where the player is aiming. Some weapons, such as sniper rifles have scopes that can zoom in on a target. These scopes can also detect an enemy's heat signatures.</p><p style="">In Medal of Honor, the player can carry around three weapons at once. He usually starts off the mission with a heavy and light weapon (for example, an assault rifle and an uzi). He also possesses a pistol. The pistol is given to him on every mission, sometimes silenced. This pistol has unlimited ammo and can be accessed by quickly hitting the weapon swap button twice. Ammo is given to the player at the beginning of a mission and he can replenish his ammo by going up to one of his squad mates and asking him for some. It's to be noted that when the player reloads, if a bullet is already in the chamber before reloading, it stays in the chamber, providing one extra bullet to shoot per magazine. The player will also encounter special weapons during certain events. For example, he may be asked to use a large sniper rifle for long range shots. During this sequence, the player must take the wind and distance into account. At other times, the player may have to use a Soflam to guide missiles to the desired target.</p><p style="">Medal of Honor offers some player movement that isn't regularly seen in modern day shooters. Players can lean from left to right by holding down the lean button (L1 on PS3, LB on 360, Q and E on PC). Players have unlimited sprint. Players can also slide. Slide is done while sprinting. While sprinting, hit the crouch/prone button and the character will slide a short distance. This is useful for getting into cover. Players can crouch and lay prone; players will crawl if they move while prone. The player can keep tabs on how much ammo he has left, what weapons he has equipped, where his squad mates are and where his objective is by hitting up on the control pad. Players can also choose the ammo type with the control pad. Players can choose to change the weapon from auto to semi-auto.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/112064/1556968-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-1556968" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/112064/1556968-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-1556968"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/112064/1556968-1.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/112064/1556968-1.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Apache Gunship</figcaption></figure><p style="">One level has the player driving an ATV. The ATV is driven like any other vehicle. It can accelerate, brake and reverse. It can also power slide and the player can turn the head lights off for stealth.

The Hellfire missiles can only be fired at enemies in front of the player, the heavy machine gun can fire in almost every direction except directly behind the Apache.</p><p style=""> </p><h2>Weapons</h2><p style="">Weapons included in the single-player and multiplayer games:</p><ul><li><b>Assault Rifles</b>: <a href="/ak-47/3055-187/" data-ref-id="3055-187">AK-47</a>, <a href="/m16a4/3055-339/" data-ref-id="3055-339">M16A4</a>,</li><li><b>Carbines</b>: <a href="/m4a1/3055-549/" data-ref-id="3055-549">M4A1</a>, <a href="/aks-74u/3055-1331/" data-ref-id="3055-1331">AKS-74U</a></li><li><b>Sub-Machine Guns</b>: <a href="/mp7/3055-2508/" data-ref-id="3055-2508">MP7A1 ,</a> <a href="/fn-p90/3055-615/" data-ref-id="3055-615">P90TR</a></li><li><b>Shotguns</b>: <a href="/toz-194/3055-3487/" data-ref-id="3055-3487">TOZ-194</a>, <a href="/remington-870/3055-1355/" data-ref-id="3055-1355">870MCS</a></li><li><b>Sniper Rifles</b>: <a href="/m21-sniper-rifle/3055-1882/" data-ref-id="3055-1882">M21</a>, <a href="/m24/3055-1335/" data-ref-id="3055-1335">M24</a>, <a href="/svd-dragunov/3055-320/" data-ref-id="3055-320">SVD</a>, <a href="/sv-98/3055-1352/" data-ref-id="3055-1352">SV-98</a> , <a href="/m110-sass/3055-2513/" data-ref-id="3055-2513">M-110</a>, <a href="/barrett-m82/3055-3886/" data-ref-id="3055-3886">M82</a></li><li><b>Machine Guns</b>: <a href="/m249-saw/3055-623/" data-ref-id="3055-623">M249</a>, <a href="/pkm/3055-1327/" data-ref-id="3055-1327">PKM</a> , <a href="/m60/3055-1324/" data-ref-id="3055-1324">MK43</a>(M60E4 with RAS)</li><li><b>Pistols</b>: <a href="/m9-pistol/3055-940/" data-ref-id="3055-940">Beretta M9</a> , <a href="/sig-sauer-p226/3055-2962/" data-ref-id="3055-2962">SIG-Sauer P226</a>, <a href="/mp-443-grach/3055-3490/" data-ref-id="3055-3490">MP-443</a></li></ul><h2>Multiplayer</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13474/1411776-moh__12_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1411776" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.8" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13474/1411776-moh__12_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1411776"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/13474/1411776-moh__12_.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/13474/1411776-moh__12_.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Firing at enemies in multiplayer</figcaption></figure><p style="">Multiplayer was built entirely by DICE and is separate from the single player campaign. It's interesting to know that when the game is booted up, the single player portion automatically loads. If players select multiplayer from the menu, the game goes to a separate load screen to load the mode.</p><p style="">Multiplayer is similar to other multiplayer modes in modern shooters. It's class-based, has killstreaks, and uses experience points for persistent progression. Unlike other EA online games, Medal of Honor does not require an online pass to access the multiplayer component. This was probably done to keep it competitive with Activision's Call of Duty series.</p><h3>Gameplay</h3><p style="">The gameplay for this mode is different from the single player. The controls have changed and certain actions that were present in the single player are absent from the multiplayer. For example, in multiplayer, players cannot slide, lean or go prone. Also, only two weapons are available at a time. The controls are very similar to what can be found in DICE's last multiplayer focused game <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/battlefield-bad-company-2/3030-25246/" data-ref-id="3030-25246">Battlefield: Bad Company 2</a>.</p><p style="">The multiplayer also has a different HUD: the ammo is marked differently and multiplayer adds a minimap. This minimap shows the location of squad mates and enemy locations when they fire their weapon or the UAV is online. The score of the current game is also displayed on the bottom left as well as killstreak progress, which starts at 0/50.</p><h3>Classes</h3><p style="">The multiplayer offers the choice of 3 classes to the player: Rifleman, Special Ops and Sniper. By choosing a class and earning points in the game, either by killing enemies, accomplishing objectives or using support actions, the player earns points specific to the class he's playing as. The player can play as one of two teams: Coalition or Opposing Forces (ex Taliban). Both teams use different weapons, weapons that can be unlocked by gaining levels (the game caps at level 15). Here is the full unlock tree for each class:</p><h4>Rifleman</h4><ol><li><b>Recruit</b>: Assault Rifle (M16A4 or AK-47)</li><li><b>Regular</b>: Extra Magazine</li><li><b>Expert</b>: Red Dot Scope (increases accuracy)</li><li><b>Veteran</b>: Light Machine Gun (M249 or Kalashnikov PKM)</li><li><b>Operator</b>: Suppressor (silences weapon but decreases range)</li><li><b>Commander</b>: Open-Tip Ammunition (increases damage)</li><li><b>Elite</b>: Long Range Combat Scope (increases range)</li><li><b>Tier 1 Recruit</b>: Muzzle Brake (increases accuracy)</li><li><b>Tier 1 Regular</b>: F2000 Assault Rifle</li><li><b>Tier 1 Expert</b>: Veteran Assault Rifle (call sign)</li><li><b>Tier 1 Veteran</b>: Veteran Light Machine Gun (call sign)</li><li><b>Tier 1 Operator</b>: Enemy Assault Rifle</li><li><b>Tier 1 Commander</b>: Pistol Ammo</li><li><b>Tier 1 Elite</b>: Enemy Light Machine Gun</li><li><b>Tier 1 Warfighter</b>: Extra Grenade</li></ol><h4>Special Ops</h4><ol><li><b>Recruit</b>: Carbine (Colt M4A1 or Kalashnikov AKS-74U)</li><li><b>Regular</b>: Extra Magazine</li><li><b>Expert</b>: Red Dot Scope</li><li><b>Veteran</b>: Combat Shotgun (Remington 870-MCS or Tula Arms TOZ-194)</li><li><b>Operator</b>: Suppressors (reduces range)</li><li><b>Commander</b>: Slugs/Open-Tip Ammunition</li><li><b>Elite</b>: Long Range Combat Scopes</li><li><b>Tier 1 Recruit</b>: Laser Sights</li><li><b>Tier 1 Regular</b>: P90 PDW</li><li><b>Tier 1 Expert</b>: Veteran Carbines</li><li><b>Tier 1 Veteran</b>: Veteran Combat Shotguns</li><li><b>Tier 1 Operator</b>: Enemy Carbine</li><li><b>Tier 1 Commander</b>: Pistol Ammo</li><li><b>Tier 1 Elite</b>: Enemy Combat Shotgun</li><li><b>Tier 1 Warfighter</b>: Extra Grenade</li></ol><h4>Sniper</h4><ol><li><b>Recruit</b>: Battle Rifle (M21 or Norinco NDM-86)</li><li><b>Regular</b>: Extra Magazine</li><li><b>Expert</b>: Long Range Combat Scope</li><li><b>Veteran</b>: Bolt Action Sniper Rifles (M24 or Izhmash SV-98)</li><li><b>Operator</b>: Laser Rangefinder</li><li><b>Commander</b>: Open-Tip Ammunition</li><li><b>Elite</b>: High Power Scopes</li><li><b>Tier 1 Recruit</b>: Suppressors</li><li><b>Tier 1 Regular</b>: G3 Battle Rifle</li><li><b>Tier 1 Expert</b>: Veteran Battle Rifle</li><li><b>Tier 1 Veteran</b>: Veteran Sniper Rifle</li><li><b>Tier 1 Operator</b>: Enemy Battle Rifles</li><li><b>Tier 1 Commander</b>: Pistol Ammo</li><li><b>Tier 1 Elite</b>: Enemy Sniper Rifles</li><li><b>Tier 1 Warfighter</b>: Extra Grenade</li></ol><h3>Game Modes</h3><p style="">Medal of Honor comes with 4 different multiplayer game modes plus a Hardcore mode that eliminates the HUD and boosts damage. There is also an "all game modes" mode that puts players into any available match. At the end of each match, a short cutscene ends the match.</p><h4>Team Assault</h4><p style="">Like the game suggests, this is regular 12 vs. 12 team deathmatch where two teams (Coalition or Op For) must kill each other to earn points. The game ends when time runs out or when the score limit is reached by one of the two teams.</p><h4>Sector Control</h4><p style="">Sector Control is a Domination game mode where two teams fight to control three different control points. Each team usually spawns next to one control point and the third one is usually in the middle of the two spawn points. To capture a control point, a team has to stay in a certain area around a flag point and raise his team's flag (the US flag or the Taliban Flag). Capturing a control point will net 20 points to each player who helped capture the control point.</p><h4>Objective Raid</h4><p style="">This is the same game mode found in Battlefield: Bad Company 2 only on a smaller scale. One team defends two objectives while the other team must place a bomb on it. Once the bomb is placed, the defending team will have a limited amount of time to disarm it. The beeping noise that the objective makes when the bomb is armed is exactly the same as in Bad Company. This mode lasts five minutes per round.</p><h4>Combat Mission</h4><p style="">Another Battlefield classic, Combat mission tasks one team to complete objectives while the opposing team tries to stop them. When the attacking team completes an objective, the map opens up to another batch of objectives. The attacking team wins if they complete all the objectives in the set time.</p><h3>Maps</h3><p style="">Medal of Honor's maps are both original and taken from the singleplayer. Each map can be played on multiple game modes while certain maps are exclusive to Combat Mission.</p><h4>Diwagal Camp</h4><p style="">Diwagal camp is a mix of both village and cave combat. One side of the map is situated in a cave while the other in a destroyed town. In the middle of the area is a road with a destroyed tank in the middle. The cave side of the map is ideal for sniping while the village ruins encourage close quarters combat. This map is playable in Team Assault, Objective Raid and Sector Control. In Sector Control, one flag is in the caves, the second in the town and the third one in the middle of the wide open road making capture not an easy task.</p><h4>Garmzir Town</h4><p style="">Garmzir Town is a small town with many tight corners, alleyways and visually crowded marketplaces. The map is broken into two separate sectors with a river running in the middle. Said river is particularly exposed to sniper fire thanks to the many small buildings that border it. The map is playable in Objective Raid, Team Assault and Sector Control.</p><h4>Kandahar Marketplace</h4><p style="">This marketplace can best be described as a sniper's paradise. Visually extremely crowded with a wide color palette that makes hiding easy. Many tall building give sharpshooters the edge while close quarters guerrilla warfare can be useful in the long alleyways and for getting rid of the snipers in the narrow buildings. This map can be played in Team Assault, Sector Control and Objective Raid.</p><h4>Kabul City Ruins</h4><p style="">This is a small urban map with a main two story building that's usually the center of attention. There are also some side streets that are ideal for urban combat. This map is playable in sector control, Team Assault and Objective Raid.</p><h2>Multiplayer Beta</h2><p style="">The Multiplayer beta for Medal of Honor started on June 21, 2010 for anyone who pre-ordered the game, although VIPs of <a href="/battlefield-bad-company-2/3030-25246/" data-ref-id="3030-25246">Battlefield: Bad Company 2</a> were able to start playing a few days earlier, on the 17th. The beta includes two maps &amp; modes; Combat Mission mode in Helmand Valley and Team Assault mode in Kabul City.</p><p style="">The game was supposed to come out on PC, PS3 and Xbox 360. However, the Xbox version has been delayed multiple times, forcing EA to extend the duration of the beta on other platforms to line up with the eventual Xbox beta. The delay was announced on the Medal of Honor blog by Matt Pruit:</p><blockquote><p style="">The Medal of Honor beta for the Xbox 360 is delayed, but it is expected to be available next week. We are extremely disappointed about this, but want to assure you that we are dedicated and determined to delivering all of you this awesome multiplayer experience as soon as possible. However, we are excited to extend the beta to make up for lost time!</p></blockquote><p style="">This was written on June 17, 2010 but since then the beta has been repeatedly delayed for the 360. A month after that post, Matt Pruit announced that the beta was being extended on PS3 and PC, with beta cards still working after the expected July 18th, 2010 expiration date. This was done so the Xbox version could line up with the other versions.</p><p style="">On October 4th, an open beta for the PC players only was available with two new maps and modes. The beta ended October 7th; anyone could have downloaded and played the game. The two maps included were: <i>Shahikot mountains</i> and <i>Kunar Base</i> . The modes included in the Open Beta were: <i>Combat Mission</i> and <i>Sector Control</i> .</p><h2>Limited Edition</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/23298/1441149-340x_medalofhonor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1441149" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="1.1558823529412" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:115.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/23298/1441149-340x_medalofhonor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1441149"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/23298/1441149-340x_medalofhonor.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/23298/1441149-340x_medalofhonor.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The PS3 Limited Edition</figcaption></figure><p style="">It was announced at <a href="/e3-2010/3015-4529/" data-ref-id="3015-4529">E3 2010</a> that the Limited Edition version of Medal of Honor released on the Playstation 3 would exclusively include a high definition remastered version of <a href="/medal-of-honor-frontline/3030-4857/" data-ref-id="3030-4857">Medal of Honor: Frontline</a>.

Set in Japan, it features an all female cast of fighters, all of whom posses their own unique weapons and powers. Arcana Heart 3 is a fast paced <a href="/sprite/3015-491/" data-ref-id="3015-491">sprite </a>based 2D fighter, of similar style to <a href="/guilty-gear/3025-287/" data-ref-id="3025-287">Guilty Gear </a>or <a href="/blazblue/3025-1502/" data-ref-id="3025-1502">BlazBlue</a>. Arcana Heart 3 was originally released for Japanese <a href="/arcade/3045-84/" data-ref-id="3045-84">arcades </a>in December 2009. <a href="/arc-system-works-co-ltd/3010-570/" data-ref-id="3010-570">Arc System Works </a>went on to release a boxed retail version in Japan, on January 13th 2011. A downloadable version that hit <a href="/playstation-network-ps3/3045-88/" data-ref-id="3045-88">PSN </a>on April 19th 2011<a href="/aksys-games/3010-932/" data-ref-id="3010-932">Aksys Games</a>, and a boxed retail copy that came to Europe on August 19th 2011, thanks to <a href="/zen-united/3010-7182/" data-ref-id="3010-7182">Zen United</a>.</p><p style=""> </p><h2>Story</h2><p style="">Arcana Heart 3 continues after the events of Arcana Heart 2.</p><p style="">A translated official summary:</p><p style=""><i> “It has been two months since Angelia Avallone attempted to use the dimensional distortion above the Kantou area in Japan for her scheme. In that time, the organization "Drexler," whom once distributed demonic arts throughout Europe during a certain war, had resumed operations all over the globe. The secret branch in Japan was destroyed by the West Europe Spirit Agency and they established the branch office "Rosenberg" there in its place. Immediately following that, a large dimensional disruption was observed by many. The timing of this event was most unnatural, and there were rumors of secret activity from the defunct Drexler branch. In order to resolve these events, the Japanese Spirit Agency has dispatched their Scared Maidens. The Rosenberg office also sent their Sacred Maidens but in their way stands a new foe, opponents that have been granted the powers of a Sacred Maiden, Valkyries.” </i></p><p style=""> </p><h2>Control Scheme</h2><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64737/1759018-206811_175040555878783_150005788382260_396303_2361281_n.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1759018" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.72990353697749" data-width="311" style="width: 311px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:73.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64737/1759018-206811_175040555878783_150005788382260_396303_2361281_n.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1759018"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64737/1759018-206811_175040555878783_150005788382260_396303_2361281_n.jpg"></a><figcaption> Arcana Heart 3 is a 5 button fighting game.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Arcana Heart 3 is 5 button fighting game which, in comparison to other fighting games, is quite different. The main attack buttons being A (Weak) B (Strong) C (Heavy) and E (Arcana). Arcana Heart 3 forgoes links for an A &gt; B &gt; C &gt; E chain system, much like <a href="/marvel-vs-capcom-3-fate-of-two-worlds/3030-30944/" data-ref-id="3030-30944">Marvel vs. Capcom 3</a>, making it easier to pull off impressive combos. The D (Homing) button is somewhat unique to Arcana Heart 3 however.</p><p style="">The D button or Homing Dash is used to propel your character towards your opponent, or away if a backward motion is input beforehand. A lot of Arcana Heart 3 is spent zipping around in the air, making this button almost mandatory if you are to catch your opponent, continue a combo or beat a hasty retreat.</p><p style=""> </p><p style="">There are a couple of special techniques that can also be executed with this button, each costing 1 bar of your Arcana Gauge, these are:</p><h3> </h3><h3>Homing Cancel</h3><p style="">The D button can be used to cancel the majority of normal moves, allowing for longer combos.</p><h3> </h3><h3>Backwards/Forwards Guard Cancel</h3><p style="">By hitting the D button and either backwards or forwards while in block stun will result in your character quickly dashing away or towards their aggressor with a large shield. Any attacks that hit the shield will cause a clash, momentarily protecting you from its damage.</p><p style=""> </p><h2>System Mechanics</h2><p style="">Arcana Heart features a number of fight mechanics, some totally unique to it, and some found in other, similar fighting games. This part may be a little confusing at first, as everything has Arcana in or around its name.</p><p style=""> </p><h3>Life Gauge</h3><p style="">As with most fighting games, the health of the characters in Arcana Heart 3 is represented with a life gauge. This gauge fades from orange to red as the character takes damage. The smaller notches below are helpful indicators of what % of health the character has remaining.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64737/1758213-hpbar.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1758213" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.17312661498708" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:17.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64737/1758213-hpbar.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1758213"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64737/1758213-hpbar.jpg"></a></figure><h3> </h3><h3> </h3><p style=""> </p><h3>Arcana Gauge</h3><p style="">The Arcana Gauge is similar to a super bar in most other fighting games, but works very differently. When starting a round, characters will have 1 bar of their Arcana Gauge filled, using supers, special cancels or critical heats will deplete this gauge; causing the green section to turn red. However, unlike most fighting games, this gauge will regenerate over time without the character having to do anything.</p><p style="">To extend the gauge beyond 1 bar, players must have a full green bar and be attacking or being hit by the other player. If there is any red caused by using supers etc. you must wait for the bar to fully recharge to green before it can be extended.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64737/1758209-arcanagauge.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1758209" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.22465753424658" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:22.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64737/1758209-arcanagauge.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1758209"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64737/1758209-arcanagauge.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64737/1758209-arcanagauge.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><h3> </h3><h3> </h3><p style=""> </p><h3>Force Gauge</h3><p style="">The Force Gauge works similarly to Arcana Gauge in that it is always charging. It can only be used once at maximum when it will begin to flash and will recharge dependent on what Arcana you have chosen and how you previously depleted the gauge. This gauge is used for a variety of things; such as Arcana Bursts, Extend Force Activation and Arcana Blaze.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64737/1758211-forceguage.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1758211" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.47266881028939" data-width="311" style="width: 311px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:47.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64737/1758211-forceguage.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1758211"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64737/1758211-forceguage.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64737/1758211-forceguage.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><h3> </h3><h3> </h3><p style=""> </p><h3>Arcana</h3><p style="">Your Arcana is the "<a href="/pokemon/3015-549/" data-ref-id="3015-549">Pokémon</a>” type creature you pick after choosing a character. They provide your character with unique ways to expend their Force Gauge using Arcana themed special moves. They can also dictate how fast the Force Gauge recharges; the Arcana you picked will be displayed behind the character portrait.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64737/1758208-arcana.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1758208" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.28618421052632" data-width="304" style="width: 304px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:28.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64737/1758208-arcana.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1758208"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64737/1758208-arcana.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64737/1758208-arcana.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><h3> </h3><h3> </h3><p style=""> </p><h3>Arcana Burst</h3><p style="">Much like the BlazBlueburst; an Arcana Burst is your GET OFF ME move. It’s activated by having a full Force Gauge and pressing the C+E buttons together. Be warned however, this will cause your Force Gauge to recharge incredibly slowly after use.</p><h3> </h3><h3>Extend Force Activation</h3><p style="">Extend Force Activation is activated by pressing the A+B+C buttons; doing so will power up your character for a short period of time, improving either their attack or defense and activating Arcana specific abilities. Extend Force Activation will also cancel the characters current animation when on the ground, allowing for extended combos.</p><h3> </h3><h3>Arcana Blaze</h3><p style="">During Extend Force Activation you gain the ability to use Arcana Blaze. This is a very powerful attack based on which Arcana you picked. It’s activated by inputting 236 A+B+C.</p><h3> </h3><h3>Critical Heat</h3><p style="">This is the characters ultimate move, dishing out a lot of damage. Critical Heats can only be used when a character has 3 bars of Arcana Gauge, the input and situational requirements for these moves vary on a per character basis. Critical Heats are also influenced by the activation of Extend Force, allowing them to do even more damage.</p><p style=""> </p><h2>Characters</h2><p style="">Arcana Heart 3 houses a total of 23 characters, all with their own unique fighting styles and moves.</p><h4><b><a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/akane-inuwaka/3005-18436/">Akane</a></b></h4><p style="">Akane Inuwaka is a cat-girl from the Inuwaka tribe.

As the game is set long before any Cybertronian had ever met a <a href="/human/3015-810/" data-ref-id="3015-810">Human</a>, characters transform into futuristic, utilitarian vehicle modes instead of replications of Earth vehicles.</p><p style="">Originally intended to stand on its own as a franchise, <i>War for Cybertron</i>'s character design is a deliberate homage to the original 80's cartoon, "The Transformers", though the characterization and storyline are entirely original, such as the idea that the villainous <a href="/starscream/3005-1786/" data-ref-id="3005-1786">Starscream</a> was originally an Autobot. Overall, the entire style of the game is a mixture of various inspirations, with the developers stating that for inspiration they looked at the cartoon, the live-action movies, the comics, and several unrelated science-fiction films such as Tron, Aliens and Blade Runner.</p><p style=""><i>War for Cybertron</i> is a third person shooter with vehicular combat elements included. Its most defining feature is the seamless transition between the two modes of play; a single button press and the player character transforms between Robot Mode and Vehicle Mode. It has three player <a href="/cooperative-play/3015-108/" data-ref-id="3015-108">co-op</a> in both campaigns, but local co-op with neither, unfortunately, and an extensive multiplayer component with class customization similar to the <a href="/modern-warfare/3025-1258/" data-ref-id="3025-1258"><i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</i></a> sub-series.</p><p style="">A demo became available on June 10th, 2010 exclusively on the Xbox 360. To its own demise however, it was multiplayer-only, with Team Deathmatch and Conquest being the two available modes. Players were also limited to only selecting the Soldier or Scout class. Both classes had a level cap of 3 (the retail game level cap being 25).</p><p style="">Although originally intended as a stand-alone storyline, Hasbro has since officially made <i>War for Cybertron</i>, and "Exodus", the tie-in novel, canon as the backstory of the newest animated series, "Transformers: Prime".</p><p style="">In November 2010, Hasbro announced that a sequel was being planned for a 2012 release. No further word came of this until October 2011, when a GameInformer-exclusive story announced <a href="/transformers-fall-of-cybertron/3030-36634/" data-ref-id="3030-36634"><i>Transformers: Fall of Cybertron</i></a>, still intended for a 2012 release.</p><h2>Campaigns</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/28314/1370950-1273085740_5231_01_0043_20100316_5ihd1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1370950" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/28314/1370950-1273085740_5231_01_0043_20100316_5ihd1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1370950"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/28314/1370950-1273085740_5231_01_0043_20100316_5ihd1.jpg"></a><figcaption>Optimus Prime's Ax.</figcaption></figure><p style="">There are two different campaigns detailing the war of Cybertron. There is the Autobot campaign where the player follows Optimus on his quest to unite the <a href="/autobots/3015-5006/" data-ref-id="3015-5006">Autobots</a> and defeat the <a href="/decepticons/3015-5007/" data-ref-id="3015-5007">Decepticons</a>. Of course, Optimus is most widely known to audiences as <a href="/optimus-prime/3005-151/" data-ref-id="3005-151">Optimus Prime</a>, but in War for Cybertron, Optimus has not yet become a Prime and is not very high in rank--often taking orders. But as the campaign progresses, he rises to assume his position as Prime and become the eventual leader of the Autobots.</p><p style="">The second campaign follows the Decepticons and features Megatron as the main character. You will follow him on his rise to power and his spiraling decent towards becoming the evil character he is more commonly known as, he wishes to initiate the "rebirth of Cybertron's golden age" through any means necessary.</p><p style="">Both campaigns are fully playable in drop in, drop out co-op with up to three players.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">War for Cybertron's core shooter gameplay is a cross between <a href="/gears-of-war/3025-565/" data-ref-id="3025-565">Gears of War</a>'s slow paced tactical shooting and <a href="/ratchet-clank/3025-411/" data-ref-id="3025-411">Ratchet and Clank</a>'s high speed arcade shooting. It is not a cover based shooter, but due to precision being required it isn't entirely arcadey either.</p><p style="">Transformation can be done at any point altering gameplay significantly. Your character can shift from robot to vehicle and vice versa at the touch of a button no matter what you are doing. The large arsenal of ranged weapons, four diverse character classes and array of abilities provide many gameplay options in both single, co-op and multiplayer. Many enemies also have the ability to transform, clever use of both robot and vehicle mode is vital to success.</p><p style="">Your weapons in War for Cybertron will match the color scheme of your character when used and are not actually held but are instead different forms your character's arm gains the ability to morph in to. Certain weapons such as the Ion Blaster have designs and names taken from or heavily influenced by the original cartoons weapons, the Blaster being highly reminiscent of G1 Optimus' iconic Ion Blaster rifle.</p><p style="">Each character has a single melee weapon at any given time that appears when the melee attack is used. All characters can hover and strafe in vehicle mode and are equipped with ranged weapons.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><h3>Arm guns</h3><ul><li>Scatter Blaster</li><li>EMP Shotgun</li><li>Energon Battle Pistol</li><li>Ion Blaster</li><li>Photon Burst Rifle</li><li>Null Ray</li><li>Neutron Repeater</li><li>Plasma Cannon</li><li>Magma Frag Launcher</li><li>Energon Repair Ray</li><li>X12 Scrapmaker</li><li>Thermo Rocket Launcher</li><li>Fusion Cannon</li></ul><h3>Grenades</h3><ul><li>Thermo Mines</li><li>Flak Grenades</li><li>EMP Grenades</li><li>Energon Grenades</li></ul><h3>Melee</h3><ul><li>Energon Blade</li><li>Energon Double Axe</li><li>Energon Club</li><li>Energon Hammer</li></ul><h2>Chassis</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/28314/1370952-1273085740_5231_01_0049_20100316_5ihd1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1370952" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/28314/1370952-1273085740_5231_01_0049_20100316_5ihd1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1370952"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/28314/1370952-1273085740_5231_01_0049_20100316_5ihd1.jpg"></a><figcaption>Robots with big guns</figcaption></figure><p style="">In order to use a chassis (character model) in multiplayer you must have unlocked them in single player.</p><p style="">Every chassis can be customized in terms of colors.

Even in the original cartoon this was shown in the first couple of episodes and should you be a fan of Transformers you would be well aware of this. In War for Cybertron, High Moon took the transformation logic a step further and had every character have a vehicle mode but not one that features a cockpit. While some of the characters appear to have them they do not and this is a visual design element only.</p><p style="">The ability to hide in plain sight while on earth was a bonus to their already existing needs for transformation and could be a game mechanic if a sequel is made and is indeed set on earth. Of course if this does happen every character will need to exchange their Cybertron vehicle mode for an Earth equivalent.</p><h2>Issues regarding the PC port</h2><p style="">PC gamers, please be aware of the plethora of issues regarding the PC version.

Most of the cast from the first game returns as well, with <a href="/">                                                            Starkiller</a> once again taking up the role of <a data-ref-id="3015-2352" href="/male-protagonists/3015-2352/">                                                      protagonist</a>.   <br /><br /><h2>Story<br /></h2>The game takes place six months after the first <a data-ref-id="3030-20626" href="/star-wars-the-force-unleashed/3030-20626/">                                                     Force Unleashed</a>. Despite having died in the canonical ending to the first game, Starkiller returns as a genetically altered <a data-ref-id="3015-284" href="/clone/3015-284/">                                                   clone</a>, created by <a data-ref-id="3005-308" href="/darth-vader/3005-308/">                                                    Darth Vader</a> in an attempt to preserve his Padawan's abilities. The story spans many planets and old characters from the <a data-ref-id="3025-551" href="/star-wars/3025-551/">                                                  Star Wars</a> saga appear. The voice cast from the first game reprise their roles and the game's main theme is the same while certain scores from the Star Wars Movies also appear. <br /> <br />The story begins in classic Star Wars fashion: text scroll while the iconic Star Wars theme plays. Once again, the galaxy is on the brink of <a data-ref-id="3015-1958" href="/galactic-civil-war/3015-1958/">                                                 civil war</a>. The <a data-ref-id="3015-2977" href="/rebels/3015-2977/">                                                rebels</a> have been attacking the <a data-ref-id="3015-1007" href="/galactic-empire/3015-1007/">                                               Empire</a> for 6 months now. However, they have suffered a severe blow: <a data-ref-id="3005-2978" href="/rahm-kota/3005-2978/">                                              General Rahm Kota</a> has been captured by the Empire and the rebels have been forced to flee to the <a data-ref-id="3035-2059" href="/outer-rim/3035-2059/">                                             Outer Rim</a> of the galaxy. Once the text has ended, the camera pans down to reveal the planet of <a data-ref-id="3035-794" href="/kamino/3035-794/">                                            Kamino</a>. Darth Vader's <a data-ref-id="3055-677" href="/tie-advanced/3055-677/">                                           Tie-Advance</a> is seen entering the orbit of the planet. Vader lands on a <a data-ref-id="3055-1179" href="/platform/3055-1179/">                                          platform</a> over the rough seas of the rainy planet and makes his way to a dark room. He looks into a prison pit where one of Starkiller's clone can be seen. Vader is still trying to overthrow <a data-ref-id="3005-2459" href="/emperor-palpatine/3005-2459/">                                         the Emperor</a> by way of a super powerful apprentice. Despite Starkiller dying at the end of the first game, Vader has continued looking for the perfect apprentice by creating clones of Starkiller. <br /> <br />The clone has been imprisoned for 13 days. Vader makes it clear that the clone was created for only one purpose: to serve him. All the other clones have gone <a data-ref-id="3015-1503" href="/insanity/3015-1503/">                                        mad</a> because they were haunted of visions from Starkillers life. The clone, to prove his worth to Vader, must pass the ultimate test. Once he has passed this test, his first mission will be to execute Kota who's being held on the planet Cato-Neimoidia. <a data-ref-id="3005-2976" href="/proxy/3005-2976/">                                       Proxy  </a><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/1409135-ful2sc3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1409135" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/1409135-ful2sc3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1409135"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/30036/1409135-ful2sc3.jpg"></a><figcaption>                                       The Clone Makes His Escape</figcaption></figure><a data-ref-id="3005-2976" href="/proxy/3005-2976/">                                       droids</a> appear and one replicates the look of <a data-ref-id="3005-1779" href="/juno-eclipse/3005-1779/">                                      Juno Eclipse</a>, Starkiller's former <a data-ref-id="3015-3857" href="/potential-love-interest/3015-3857/">                                     love interest</a>. Each time the clone goes to strike her, he is unable and is <a data-ref-id="3015-2574" href="/torture/3015-2574/">                                    tortured</a> by violent visions. Vader explains that he must learn to hate what he loved and that this clone, like the others, is of no use to him. Refusing to share the same fate as his brothers, the clone force zaps Vader, makes a giant hole in the building he was in and escapes. After <a data-ref-id="3015-2612" href="/skydiving/3015-2612/">                                   skydiving</a> for a bit and killing all the Imperial troops on the planet, the clone has the idea to steal Vader's <a data-ref-id="3055-675" href="/tie-fighter/3055-675/">                                  Tie Fighter</a>. Vader almost stops him but the clone gets away. <br /> <br />The clone makes his way to the planet Cato-Neimoidia. Kota is being held by the Baron. The blind Jedi is the planet's main attraction as he fights in <a data-ref-id="3035-1744" href="/arena/3035-1744/">                                 the stadium</a> defeating the most dangerous creatures. The stadium where he fights is situated in the sky city of Tarko-Se and Kota has been fighting for seven straight days. The clone passes himself as Vader which lets him land with ease on the planet. But when the Baron discovers that Vader, it is not, and that the clone is here for Kota, he flees and sends all kinds of bad guys after him. After slogging through waves after waves of troopers and killing a gigantic <a data-ref-id="3055-361" href="/helicopter/3055-361/">                                helicopter</a>, the clone finally makes it to the stadium. He reunites with Kota who expresses joy, thinking that the clone is in fact Starkiller. The reunion is cut short when the baron unleashes his most powerful creature: the Gorog. This towering beast is so huge, that the only solution for defeating it is to "sink" the city (make it fall through the clouds). Starkiller and Kota separate and begin to make the city fall and they reunite in the Baron's lodge. The Baron is about to get the upper hand on Kota when the city begins to fall and the Gorog latches on to the lodge, eating the Baron and taking Kota in his fall. The clone skydives to save Kota and finishes off the Gorog. As the two Jedi <a data-ref-id="3015-2682" href="/freefall/3015-2682/">                               freefall</a>, Kota orders his ship, the <a data-ref-id="3055-2475" href="/rogue-shadow/3055-2475/">                              Rogue Shadow</a> and the two are saved. <br /> <br />Kota is rejoiced to meet his old friend. The clone claims that he is not Starkiller but a clone. Kota claims that this is impossible as you can not clone <a data-ref-id="3015-655" href="/the-jedi/3015-655/">                             Jedi</a>. The clone doesn't know what to think and needs to <a data-ref-id="3015-3910" href="/meditation/3015-3910/">                            meditate</a> on a far off planet. Kota scolds him, telling him that it is time to strike  <figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1465009-starkiller_dagobah_copy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1465009" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1465009-starkiller_dagobah_copy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1465009"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1465009-starkiller_dagobah_copy.jpg"></a><figcaption>Dagobah</figcaption></figure>at the Empire. When the clone asks the old Jedi where Juno is, Kota replies that he does not know. The clone heads for the planet of <a data-ref-id="3035-884" href="/dagobah/3035-884/">                           Dagobah</a>. There he finds <a data-ref-id="3005-7" href="/yoda/3005-7/">                          Yoda</a>, who speaks in <a data-ref-id="3015-932" href="/puzzles/3015-932/">                         riddles</a> telling him to enter the <a data-ref-id="3035-1727" href="/cave/3035-1727/">                        cave</a> of mysteries to seek what he wants. The clone enters and is welcomed by other versions of himself, dying. He finds Juno and has a vision of the future. He sees Juno getting shot and captured. The clone rushes back to the ship to announce this to Kota who decides that they should head to the Outer Rim to meet Juno who is now an officer in the <a data-ref-id="3015-1006" href="/rebel-alliance/3015-1006/">                       rebellion</a>. At the same time, the game shows Vader hiring <a data-ref-id="3005-1669" href="/boba-fett/3005-1669/">                      Boba Fett</a> to capture Juno and bring her back to Kamino. Vader knows that this will lead the clone to him.  <br /> <br /> Kota and the clone arrive at a flock of rebel ships. They head to The Salvation, where Juno is stationed. Upon arriving however, the ship becomes under attack by Imperial forces and terror droids. The clone tries to get to Juno but he fails and she is kidnapped by Fett. Kota decides that the Rebel Alliance must strike against the Empire and the clone gives Kota the plans to the Imperial cloning facility on Kamino. Upon arriving into the planet's orbit, the Empire ambush the rebels and the planet's shields make it impossible to land on the planet. The Rebels are about to be forced to retreat when the clone has the ingenious idea to crash the serenity into the cloning plant. The Serenity is evacuated and the clone crashes it into the facility, allowing the rebels to raid it. <br /> <br />The clone helps Kota and the others attack the cloning facility but he warns Kota that he's here for Juno. Despite Kota not wanting the clone to go on alone, the clone does it anyways. After climbing the facility's spire, the clone begins having increasingly violent visions and is ambushed by Vader (this scene is a major call back to the Empire Strikes Back). Vader fights the clone, telling him he's expendable and that he's going to kill him "a thousand times". After a fairly long fight, Vader flees and the clone gives chase. He finds Vader with Juno. Vader tells him to lay down his lightsabers and become his <a data-ref-id="3015-1779" href="/slavery/3015-1779/">                     slave</a> if he wants Juno to live. The clone does what he's told; drops his sabers and kneels in front of Vader. Juno grabs one of the lightsabers and attempts to stab Vader who evades and force pushes Juno out the window and onto a platform,  <figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1246/1395406-swtfu2_4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1395406" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1246/1395406-swtfu2_4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1395406"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1246/1395406-swtfu2_4.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1246/1395406-swtfu2_4.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Kamino</figcaption></figure>apparently killing her. This sends the clone into a furious rage and after yet another battle the clone defeats Vader by cutting off his right hand and zapping him until his voice box starts going haywire. The clone holds Vader at his mercy, Vader who tells him that the clone is but an empty shell and that <a data-ref-id="3015-1431" href="/love/3015-1431/">                    love</a> means nothing. Kota arrives and tells the clone that perhaps killing Vader is not a good idea since the clone will never know the truth about his past. Kota wants to take Vader as a prisoner, judge him, then execute him. At this point, the player is given a choice to either kill Vader (    Dark Side) or let him be taken as prisoner (Light Side). <br /> <br /><h3>Light Side Ending </h3>The clone decides to let Vader be taken prisoner. He rushes to Juno's body and embraces it. Suddenly, it's revealed that Juno is in fact alive and the two share a <a data-ref-id="3015-6210" href="/kiss/3015-6210/">                  kiss</a>. <a data-ref-id="3005-4673" href="/princess-leia-organa-solo/3005-4673/">                 Princess Leia</a> arrives and Vader is boarded onto the Rogue Shadow. The clone visits Vader who answers none of his questions. When he says that he's finally free, Vader replies that he'll never be free as long as Juno is alive. The Rogue Shadow enters light-speed while a concealed a <a data-ref-id="3055-4247" href="/slave-i/3055-4247/">                Slave I</a> sneakily follows them (another reference to Empire Strikes Back). <br /> <br /><h3>Dark Side Ending </h3>The clone is about to execute Vader when suddenly a lightsaber sticks out of his chest. A hooded <a data-ref-id="3015-1407" href="/sith/3015-1407/">               Sith</a> appears from behind the clone, who falls to the ground. The Sith frees Vador and force pushes Kota and the rest of the rebels to their <a data-ref-id="3015-725" href="/death/3015-725/">              deaths</a> into the stormy water of Kamino. As the clone lives his final moments, Vader explains to him that he wasn't the most perfect clone after all. The Sith removes his hood and is revealed to be a clone. The good clone dies while the Sith goes to hunt the last of the <a data-ref-id="3015-1006" href="/rebel-alliance/3015-1006/">             Rebel Alliance</a>. He passes in front of Juno's lifeless body, barely giving it a glimpse, making him the perfect clone.<br /><h2>Gameplay</h2>For the first time, Starkiller can dual wield lightsabers, which changes the game's fighting style and combos completely. The game will have more <a data-ref-id="3015-3" href="/projectiles/3015-3/">            ranged attacks</a> with the return of the game's trademark over the top force powers. Old powers return, like force grip. The camera work and <a data-ref-id="3015-416" href="/lock-on/3015-416/">           targeting</a> around force grip has been reworked. For example, you can now grab a Tie Fighter, crush it into a ball and throw it. One of the new force powers is the iconic Jedi mind trick. When you first get this power, you can turn enemies into allies but once you upgrade it, the enemies will throw themselves off cliffs and even turn into smart bombs, running into a group of enemies and blowing up. <br /><br />There are different types of enemies in the game. <a data-ref-id="3015-2030" href="/stormtrooper/3015-2030/">          Stormtroopers</a> are at the bottom of the food chain while riot troopers who can block your lightsaber attacks and <a data-ref-id="3055-6" href="/jet-pack/3055-6/">         jet pack</a> wearing stormtroopers represent a challenge for Starkiller.

However, under the belief that their predominantly male target audience would not play such a game starring a woman, management demanded that the protagonist be replaced with a man, and further tied the previously-unrelated game into the then-abandoned <a href="/true-crime/3025-257/" data-ref-id="3025-257">True Crime</a> franchise. However, due to factors such as the abysmal critical reception and sales of the last True Crime game, <a href="/true-crime-new-york-city/3030-3345/" data-ref-id="3030-3345">True Crime: New York City</a>, and concerns over how the game would perform in the current market, the game underwent a turbulent development cycle. Initially, the game was developed at <a href="/luxoflux-corp/3010-1929/" data-ref-id="3010-1929">Luxoflux</a>, but Activision halted development, only to restart the project at United Front Games. The game was initially entitled simply "True Crime", and then changed to "True Crime: Hong Kong".</p><p style="">Activision cancelled the title a second time in February of 2011, and the game was subsequently picked up by Square-Enix, who made the announcement on August 1st, 2011. However, because Square-Enix did not purchase the True Crime intellectual property, the game was forced to undergo one final name change. On February 8th, 2012, Square-Enix officially announced that development had been resumed, and that the game had been renamed "Sleeping Dogs". The game was released on August 14, 2012 in the US and August 17th, 2012 in Europe and Australia.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p style="">The game tells the story of <a href="/wei-shen/3005-14298/" data-ref-id="3005-14298">Wei Shen</a>, an Chinese-American cop who is transferred to Hong Kong to infiltrate the Triads. According to the developers, he's based off Leonardo DiCaprio's character in the movie <i>The Departed</i>, which was in turn a remake of a Hong Kong movie entitled <i>Infernal Affairs</i>. They wanted to make a hero who got hit a lot and didn't seem invincible.</p><p style="">During an undercover operation Wei is arrested and taken to a holding cell where he meets an old friend, Jackie Ma, who offers Wei a job and a possible in with the Sun On Yee family. After a meeting with the Hong Kong Police Inspector, Wei agrees to take the offer in order to infiltrate the Triads, sinking deep into the machinations of one of the world's most notorious criminal organizations. Initially, Wei has to prove himself to the Sun On Yee that he is not a cop, but earns their trust. However, being arrested again, Wei is introduced to Inspector <a href="/jane-teng/3005-25876/" data-ref-id="3005-25876">Jane Teng</a>, whom he agrees to help with various investigations around the city outside of his undercover operation.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">The game was revealed to the press at GDC 2010. In the demo given, <a href="/united-front-games/3010-6705/" data-ref-id="3010-6705">United Front</a> emphasized their focus on recreating the sort of action seen in Hong Kong action movies. That means that a big focus of the game will be put on melee combat and environmental moves, in combination with the game's take on <a href="/parkour/3015-272/" data-ref-id="3015-272">parkour</a> and free-running. The game's shooting will feature both feature a manual mode and a lock-on system, since a lock-on system will be easier to use in combination with the <a href="/parkour/3015-272/" data-ref-id="3015-272">free-running</a> and melee elements. Since there are former <a href="/ea-black-box/3010-1639/" data-ref-id="3010-1639">Black Box</a> employees at <a href="/united-front-games/3010-6705/" data-ref-id="3010-6705">United Front Games</a>, the driving in the game will be very similar to the <a href="/need-for-speed/3025-483/" data-ref-id="3025-483">Need for Speed</a> series of games.</p><p style="">Playing as Wei Shen the player completes various missions from both sides of the law. Depending on how you complete your mission plays a huge part on how much experience you gain from the police and triad. By completing police missions, lessening nearby environment destruction, and reducing the amount of innocent civilians killed will result in an increase to your police xp.

In these sequences, the player is chasing a criminal. As a Wei runs, he pushes people out of the way and vaults over objects. Hong Kong has been mapped in such a way that it's adapted to the game play. During these chase sequences, the player will engage in hand-to-hand combat. Wei can use his fists, as well as weapons such as knives, meat cleavers and the environment. Enemies can be pushed into TVs, have their faces run against vents and and be thrown from rooftops. The game also has a counter system where an enemy flashes red to indicate when a counter can be performed.</p><p style="">The melee combat is reminiscent of <a href="/batman-arkham-asylum/3030-23245/" data-ref-id="3030-23245">Batman: Arkham Asylum</a> and <a href="/batman-arkham-city/3030-29443/" data-ref-id="3030-29443">Batman: Arkham City</a>, bringing a similar timing and counter based approach to fights. The main attack button can be done in normal and heavy versions by tapping or holding to button, the counter button can (and should) be hit when an enemy is highlighted red, and the grapple button allows you to grab most enemies. Once grappled you can punch, throw, drag, or preform a variety of environmental attacks, which range from throwing in a dumpster to shoving a persons head into an incinerator. Wei also has the ability to lock onto enemies which allows for more precise and creative attack patterns. A specific side quest allows Wei to learn more combos to help him take down foes in even more ways.</p><figure data-align="left" data-size="medium" data-ref-id="1300-2293622" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48227/2293622-screen_shot_2012_08_15_at_8.45.30_am.png" data-ratio="0.55692055692056" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:55.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48227/2293622-screen_shot_2012_08_15_at_8.45.30_am.png" data-ref-id="1300-2293622"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/48227/2293622-screen_shot_2012_08_15_at_8.45.30_am.png"></a><figcaption>The skill tree allows Wei to unlock new moves</figcaption></figure><p style="">The game incorporates the <a href="/cell-phone/3055-342/" data-ref-id="3055-342">cell phone</a> function that has become a feature in many open world games, most notably <a href="/grand-theft-auto-iv/3030-20457/" data-ref-id="3030-20457">GTA IV</a>. Using his phone Wei can call contacts (Triad Members, Girls, Police handlers, etc) to gain access to side/miscellaneous quests. There is also a text feature, but it always sends scripted messages that are used in the context of a mission. Wei can access the variety of CI Reports, Background info, and surveillance gatherings through the reports tab, access the social hub, and during some missions take pictures.</p><p style="">One of the key features of the game is known as Face. It has several passive advantages to help the player outside of combat, such as making consumables last longer, discounts, and additional contacts, but it is most obvious in combat. Dealing damage (it seems that more impressive attacks/counters will help more) will fill up the Face Meter, and once it is filled up, Wei regenerates health, intimidates enemies, and through unlocks gains additional advantages such as unblockable attacks and reduced damage. Face is upgraded through side missions and goes to level 10.</p><h2>Delayed, Dead, and Delivered</h2><figure data-align="right" data-size="medium" data-ref-id="1300-1399328" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2164/1399328-truecrime_screenshot05_1600.jpg" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2164/1399328-truecrime_screenshot05_1600.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1399328"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2164/1399328-truecrime_screenshot05_1600.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2164/1399328-truecrime_screenshot05_1600.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The game in its True Crime days</figcaption></figure><p style="">In 2009, shortly after <a href="/activision/3010-78/" data-ref-id="3010-78">Activision</a> put the old <a href="/true-crime/3025-257/" data-ref-id="3025-257">True Crime</a> moniker on it, the game was delayed through 2011.

Due to the fact that <a href="/arkham-asylum/3035-1236/" data-ref-id="3035-1236">Arkham Asylum</a> and <a href="/blackgate-penitentiary/3035-2426/" data-ref-id="3035-2426">Blackgate Prison</a> are both unfit to store prisoners, Sharp has the slums of Gotham walled off in order to create a new "prison" for the inmates, nicknamed " <a href="/arkham-city/3035-3613/" data-ref-id="3035-3613">Arkham City</a>". With the walls in place, Sharp lets the inmates loose with one simple rule: not to try and escape. Psychologist <a href="/hugo-strange/3005-16295/" data-ref-id="3005-16295">Hugo Strange</a> is brought in as the 'warden' of this new prison.</p><p style="">Sharp secretly hopes that by placing all the dangerous Gotham criminals into an isolated part of the city, they will simply all kill each other, thus getting rid of the criminal problem in Gotham. However, the criminals quickly form into different gangs, all led by Batman's toughest enemies. One is lead by the Joker, with <a href="/">Harley Quinn</a> at his side. <a href="/two-face/3005-4995/" data-ref-id="3005-4995">Two-Face</a> also leads a gang, but since he was only recently placed in the facility, he has to prove his worth to build up a powerful gang. He plans to do this by killing <a href="../../catwoman/94-654/" rel="nofollow">Catwoman</a>. The third major gang belongs to <a href="/the-penguin/3005-5818/" data-ref-id="3005-5818">the Penguin</a>, who has somehow manged to arm his minions with cutting-edge military technology.</p><p style="">The game begins with the player playing as Bruce Wayne, who has taken a sudden interest in politics, and is trying to get Arkham City closed down. During a press conference, Strange's men (a mercenary strike team called TYGER) interfere and capture Bruce. Batman's alter-ego wakes up strapped to a chair, as Strange reveals that he knows Bruce is Batman, and that soon everything will end when he unleashes "Protocol 10". Bruce is set free in Arkham City, briefly tangles with the Penguin's men, and climbs a building in order to get a signal to his allies. Bruce orders Alfred to send him his suit via the Batwing, and Bruce Wayne gives way to Batman.</p><p style="">Batman hears that Catwoman is being held by Two-Face in the courthouse. Determined to find out what Protocol 10 is, the Caped Crusader decides to go and save Selina in hopes that she'll know more about what's going on. After saving the cat and barely avoiding an assassination attempt from the Joker, Batman decides to go and pay the Joker a visit at his base in the steel mill. The Joker is deathly ill, suffering the aftereffects of the massive dose of Titan he injected himself with at the end of the first game, and his gang is controlled for the most part by Harley Quinn. Upon arriving at Joker's location, Joker fakes his death with a double and captures Batman. The Bat wakes up tied to a wheelchair, with an IV in his arm administering Joker's contaminated blood to him. The Joker explains that he will be dead in a matter of hours and now, so will Batman. There is no cure to his sickness, as all the doctors the psycho brought in have failed to cure him. <a href="/mr-freeze/3005-5866/" data-ref-id="3005-5866">Mister Freeze</a> was developing a cure before he was kidnapped by the Penguin. Furthermore, the Joker has anonymously donated his poisoned blood to every hospital in Gotham City, so that even if he dies, he'll have the last laugh. Batman now only has a couple of hours to find a cure before he, and the innocent people who receive the Joker's blood, die. As a token of his gratitude for his "help", the Joker pushes Batman's wheelchair out a five story window, almost killing him.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/134083/1873622-penguincloseup.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1873622" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.562" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/134083/1873622-penguincloseup.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1873622"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/134083/1873622-penguincloseup.jpg"></a><figcaption>The Penguin</figcaption></figure><p style="">Batman succeeds in stopping the Penguin and rescuing Freeze, who reveals that he is nowhere close to a cure. Batman figures out that a cure could be fabricated by using <a href="/ras-al-ghul/3005-10163/" data-ref-id="3005-10163">Ra's al Ghul</a>'s blood. Batman tracks down al Ghul's hideout with a little help from Robin and reunites with <a href="/talia-al-ghul/3005-13248/" data-ref-id="3005-13248">Talia al Ghul</a>, his daughter, who loves Batman and knows his secret identity. The only problem is that Batman is sick, very sick. He's so sick that at one point, Oracle asks him what his will to <a href="/robin/3005-3822/" data-ref-id="3005-3822">Robin</a> should be, how should he carry on the flame. He even passes out and sees "The Light" and his parents, beckoning him to come and join them. He eventually makes it to Ra's' hideout, and has no choice but to accept the trials to become the master of the League of Shadows, as it allows him to drink a mysterious potion called the Demon's Blood, which gives him his strength back, but will only delay the onset of his symptoms by a matter of hours. Batman passes all the trials but refuses to kill Ra's and replace him as the new master of the League. He still succeeds in getting the master's blood and heads back to Freeze, who creates an antidote but betrays the Caped Crusader, hoping to use the antidote as leverage to force Batman to rescue Freeze's wife Nora, still in her cryogenic chamber, who has been 'kidnapped' by the Joker's men. They do battle, and Batman wins, but the antidote was stolen by Harley Quinn during the fight.</p><p style="">Now genuinely pissed off, Batman goes back to the steel mill to get the cure from a much-healthier looking Joker. Just as the Dark Knight is about to defeat the Clown Prince of Crime, Strange initiates Protocol 10, which is in fact the mass extermination of all prisoners in Arkham City, in order to make the world a better place. Batman is crushed by rubble and is about to get his face ripped off by the Joker when Talia suddenly appears and offers the Joker immortality via her father's Lazarus Pit. Talia takes the Joker away while triggering a homing beacon previously planted on one of her ninjas, so Batman will be able to find her again. Batman is saved by Catwoman, and wants to go after Talia, but Alfred blocks his access to the WayneTech tracking satellites, claiming that Bruce mustn't let emotions get in the way, that Batman was destined to save the world and that this is what he must do.</p><p style="">With no other choice, Batman goes after Strange, who gloats to his men that soon, facilities like Arkham City will be constructed in other major cities like <a href="/metropolis/3035-114/" data-ref-id="3035-114">Metropolis</a> and Keystone City. It's revealed that Strange is but a puppet, and has been working for Ra's al Ghul all along, sharing his vision of violently ridding the world of criminal scum. For failing to defeat Batman, Ra's murders Strange, who then triggers Protocol 11, a safeguard which even al Ghul didn't know about - which causes his tower headquarters to violently explode. Batman and al Ghul jump out but Ra's commits suicide with his own sword in the air in an attempt to take Batman with him, which fails. With Protocol 10 stopped, Batman goes to save Talia, who is being held by Joker in a movie theatre. The Joker holds Talia at gunpoint, but she manages to escape her captor and kill the Joker by impaling him with her sword. Batman reprimands Talia for killing the clown right before Talia is shot in the back and killed by... the Joker. It's revealed that the Joker is still very much alive, and very much sick, inches away from dying (much like Batman). The Joker lying dead on the floor isn't actually the Joker, or dead; the healthy Joker Batman has been dealing with since the theft of the cure was <a href="/clayface/3005-5776/" data-ref-id="3005-5776">Clayface</a> all along. It turns out that although Harley stole the cure from Mister Freeze, Talia went and stole it right back before it could be administered to the Joker.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48227/1868514-08_joker_sick_laugh_sm_304.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1868514" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.2798634812287" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:128.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48227/1868514-08_joker_sick_laugh_sm_304.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1868514"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/48227/1868514-08_joker_sick_laugh_sm_304.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/48227/1868514-08_joker_sick_laugh_sm_304.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The last joke?</figcaption></figure><p style="">Batman is forced to fight Clayface, and eventually defeats him thanks to the ice grenades he was given by Mister Freeze, and obtains the cure. Batman drinks half of the cure, becoming healthy again, as the Joker laughs his head off at Talia's death. The Clown Prince of Crime explains that despite the fact that the Joker has created so much mayhem and has killed the one woman who has ever loved Batman, the Dark Knight is still forced to save him as that is his rule of conduct. As Batman debates whether or not to save him, the Joker attacks him, causing the hero to drop the cure which breaks on the ground. Batman looks on as the Joker tries to save the cure, and states that despite all the mayhem, he would've saved him. Shocked, the Joker dies with a smile on his face. Batman walks the Joker's corpse out of Arkham City and leaves it on a police car. <a href="/james-gordon/3005-6404/" data-ref-id="3005-6404">Commissioner Gordon</a> arrives, asking Batman "What the hell happened in there?". The Caped Crusader ignores the question and just walks away.</p><h3>Epilogue</h3><p style="">If players go back to the steel mill, where Joker's base of operations were set up, they'll see Harley Quinn's original uniform. By the uniform is a pregnancy test. The pregnancy test shows positive (+). In the finale of the credits, players can hear Harley Quinn singing a lullaby. The song goes, "hush little baby don't say a word, momma's gonna kill for you the whole damn world." This was originally interpreted by fans to mean as a hint towards a potential plot point in a sequel with Harley carrying the Joker's child. However, the follow-up story DLC Harley Quinn's Revenge puts this possibility to rest as it shows that the original pregnancy test was actually a false positive and that Harley was not in fact pregnant. </p><h3>Catwoman</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/110502/1799980-1839747_0_catwoman_risky_super.png" data-ref-id="1300-1799980" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.28" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:128.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/110502/1799980-1839747_0_catwoman_risky_super.png" data-ref-id="1300-1799980"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/110502/1799980-1839747_0_catwoman_risky_super.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/110502/1799980-1839747_0_catwoman_risky_super.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>What are Catwoman's true motives?</figcaption></figure><p style="">Catwoman, Selina Kyle, has a different storyline than Batman's that takes place over four episodes. Catwoman starts the game while trying to steal a microchip from Two-Face, who captures her and dangles her over a vat of acid. She's saved by Batman, and further damages Two-Face's face. After leaving Batman's company she resolves to steal the valuables Dr. Strange has seized from Arkham's prisoners. Catwoman asks Poison Ivy for help, and after fighting some of her goons, she is convinced to creates a hole allowing Catwoman to get inside the vault.</p><p style="">After defeating several guards she leaves the vault only to be confronted by a picture of Batman trapped underneath some rubble. There are two possible endings to the situation. One is that she has a sudden change of heart and decides to go to Batman's aid. The other is that she abandons Batman to his fate, and the game ends. After a while the credits will rewind and give the player the opportunity to make the "right" choice. After saving Batman, Catwomen goes back to her apartment to get the rest of the loot that she stole from Strange before escaping from Arkham. Only to discover that Two-Face has stolen all of it. Selina tracks Dent down but realizes that he's sold half of the loot already. Catwoman's role ends with her searching for her missing loot.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">Arkham City's gameplay is similar to its predecessor with some added touches. Batman's movements default to a walk. Holding down the run button will make Batman run and jump over certain obstacles. Pressing the run button twice will make Batman roll.</p><p style="">Movement in Arkham City isn't just limited to running around. Batman has his trusty grappling hook and cape to help him fly around. Batman can use his grappling hook to shoot himself up to ledges, and the grapnel boost upgrade propels him above ledges where he can use his cape to glide. Batman can now dive bomb while gliding. This can be used to take out enemies, solve puzzles or glide some more. Batman can also wall jump to keep on gliding in tight spaces.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48227/1811248-051_silent_takedown_90.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1811248" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48227/1811248-051_silent_takedown_90.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1811248"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/48227/1811248-051_silent_takedown_90.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/48227/1811248-051_silent_takedown_90.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Stealth is a major component of Arkham City.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Combat in Arkham City is a mix of one button combos and counters. Batman kicks and punches with the press of one button. As he racks up a combo, his moves become quicker and more aggressive. Batman can also counter enemy attacks. He can counter up to 3 attacks at once. Finally, if an enemy is knocked down, Batman can finish them off. Chaining attacks makes the multiplier go up. Once the player has reached x10, he can unleash a devastating attack (Batman calls in bats that stun all surrounding enemies; Batman jumps into the air, throwing Batarangs at all enemies on the ground, finishing them off). Some of these attacks will stop the multiplier while getting hit by an attack will set the combo multiplier back to zero. Arkham City adds critical strikes where if the player times his strikes correctly, he can inflict a critical blow on his foes. Batman can also use stealth, hiding on top of gargoyles or in vents, silently taking down enemies (there are also smack-downs during these stealth takedowns where players can quicken the takedown but risk alerting nearby guards).</p><p style="">Detective Vision lets Batman see weak structures, hidden fuse boxes and power lines. It's also very useful during stealth as it tells the player how many enemies there are in the area, how many are armed and what their state of mind is. Detective mode can also be used to solve Riddler Challenges. Addition support during the game is provided by both <a href="../../alfred-pennyworth/94-8250/" rel="nofollow">Alfred Pennyworth</a> and <a href="/oracle/3005-10356/" data-ref-id="3005-10356">Oracle</a> AKA Barbara Gordon.</p><h3>Gadgets</h3><p style="">Batman has a wide array of gadgets that he uses against his foes</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Gadget</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td><b><a href="../../grapnel-gun/93-4307/" rel="nofollow">Grapnel Gun</a></b></td><td>The grapnel gun is a gas-powered pistol that fires a piton attached to a high-tension wire, which has the ability to retract that line while accommodating the weight of the user.

href="/2k-games/3010-360/" data-ref-id="3010-360">2K Games</a>, developed by <a href="/yager-development-gmbh/3010-5683/" data-ref-id="3010-5683">YAGER</a> (with multiplayer developed by <a href="/darkside-game-studios/3010-7305/" data-ref-id="3010-7305">Darkside Game Studios</a>) and released on June 26, 2012. The game is a reboot of <a href="/take-two-interactive-software-inc/3010-450/" data-ref-id="3010-450">Take-Two</a>'s <a href="/spec-ops/3025-1738/" data-ref-id="3025-1738">Spec Ops</a> series, originally a series of tactical shooters by <a href="/zombie-studios/3010-1865/" data-ref-id="3010-1865">Zombie Studios</a>, and last seen as a series of budget squad-based shooters for the <a href="/playstation/3045-22/" data-ref-id="3045-22">PlayStation</a>.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2066104-srgame_2011_10_21_16_37_36_86.png" data-ref-id="1300-2066104" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2066104-srgame_2011_10_21_16_37_36_86.png" data-ref-id="1300-2066104"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/39/2066104-srgame_2011_10_21_16_37_36_86.png"></a><figcaption>Delta Squad came to find survivors. What they found was worse. What they did was worst of all.</figcaption></figure><p style="">While the basic tenets of gameplay should be familiar to anyone who's played <a href="/mass-effect/3025-560/" data-ref-id="3025-560">Mass Effect</a>, <a href="/gears-of-war/3025-565/" data-ref-id="3025-565">Gears of War</a> or <a href="/army-of-two/3025-1250/" data-ref-id="3025-1250">Army of Two</a>, Spec Ops: The Line places a heavy emphasis on moral choices with a dark single-player story that forces players to make difficult decisions in a war-torn wasteland. Set in <a href="/dubai/3035-2704/" data-ref-id="3035-2704">Dubai</a> after a catastrophic series of sandstorms destroys the city, the game focuses on Delta Squad, an elite three-man team sent to investigate Dubai after the military discovers a distress call from Lt. Col. <a href="/john-konrad/3005-23597/" data-ref-id="3005-23597">John Konrad</a>, whose battalion abandoned their post to lead a failed evacuation of the city. Though sent only to perform reconnaissance, Capt. <a href="/martin-walker/3005-13723/" data-ref-id="3005-13723">Martin Walker</a> (played by <a href="/nolan-north/3040-80008/" data-ref-id="3040-80008">Nolan North</a>) leads his team - heavy weapons specialist <a href="/adams/3005-23592/" data-ref-id="3005-23592">Alphanso Adams</a> and sniper/technician <a href="/lugo/3005-23591/" data-ref-id="3005-23591">John Lugo</a> - deeper into the ravaged city in search of Konrad, and into a war with the various factions of survivors. With no other options and no clear good guys, Walker and crew must fight their way through Dubai, forced to make choices that will bring their morality and sanity into question. The player witnesses the toll the events take on Delta Squad firsthand, as Walker, Lugo and Adams professional soldier veneer unravels as everything in Dubai goes wrong.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">At its core, Spec Ops: The Line follows the examples of most cover-based shooters. Walker and his enemies can take very few hits so cover is essential to surviving attacks by survivors. Walker can sprint; slide into cover; blind-fire from behind cover; swap between cover points; and vault over certain barriers, which can be used to kill enemies on the opposite side of a cover point as Walker. The game offers several different weapon types including rifles, pistols, machine guns, and shotguns, many of which contain secondary functions and enhancements to increase the player's options (<i>e.g.</i>, <a href="/silencer/3055-489/" data-ref-id="3055-489">silencers</a>, <a href="/grenade-launcher/3055-252/" data-ref-id="3055-252">grenade launchers</a>, and <a href="/scope/3055-738/" data-ref-id="3055-738">scopes</a>). Walker is able to carry two weapons plus three of each of the game's three grenade types: <a href="/frag-grenade/3055-3074/" data-ref-id="3055-3074">frag</a>, <a href="/sticky-bombs/3055-224/" data-ref-id="3055-224">sticky</a> and <a href="/flashbang/3055-551/" data-ref-id="3055-551">stun</a>. Outside of cover, Walker also has a melee attack that can be used to stun enemies and execute stunned or heavily wounded enemies with a brutal up-close kill.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2066102-screenshot_00320.png" data-ref-id="1300-2066102" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2066102-screenshot_00320.png" data-ref-id="1300-2066102"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/39/2066102-screenshot_00320.png"></a><figcaption>Sandstorms limit visibility, but Walker shoots and soldiers on.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Walker is assisted by Adams and Lugo, controlled by AI. As the ranking officer of the squad, Walker can issue orders to his two squad-mates. Using a targeting system, the player can order their squadmates to focus attention on a specified target until said target is killed. Depending on the enemy targeted, the player can utilize their team's talents in various ways - Adams can throw grenades to take out crowds of enemies at closer range, while Lugo's sniping can be used to suppress enemy snipers, rocket launchers and other insurgents just out of reach. Additionally, context-sensitive prompts allow the player to order their squad to throw flashbangs to blind enemies, as well as revive a downed squadmate.</p><p style="">Sand plays a huge role in The Line's combat. Certain barriers, usually windows and vents with sand seeping through, can be destroyed to dump sand on enemies, the effects of which can range from a small blinding cloud that stuns a few to a torrential downpour that kills several. Grenades thrown into sand will kick up a large dust cloud around the blast radius for several seconds, blinding foes not close enough to be killed by the explosion and giving the player an opening to take them out. Explosive containers can also be found throughout the battlefield, and like grenades, serve a double use as explosive weapons and makeshift stun grenades. At predetermined points in the story, the player will do battle with the elements and be forced to brave the violent sandstorms that destroyed Dubai. Walker can still engage in combat during sandstorms, but orders to Lugo and Adams are drowned out by the storm.</p><p style=""><a href="/collectibles/3015-375/" data-ref-id="3015-375">Collectibles</a> appear in the form of intel, namely <a href="/audio-logs/3015-2038/" data-ref-id="3015-2038">audio-logs</a> and reflections by Walker that provide extra backstory on the events leading up to the storm, the culture of destroyed Dubai and characters central to the plot.</p><h2>Multiplayer</h2><p style="">The multiplayer features the same cover based combat as players choose one of two factions. Players can expect sandstorms to play a prominent role during multiplayer matches, blinding the player but also blinding their opponents. Players can choose from a multitude of classes that can be customized to the player's liking with various weapons available for use.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style="">When word first started getting out that Dubai was under threat of being destroyed by catastrophic sandstorms, it was already too late. The government had long since abandoned the people when evacuation was necessary. United States Army Lt. Col. <a href="/john-konrad/3005-23597/" data-ref-id="3005-23597">John Konrad</a>, fresh off a tour in Afghanistan with his 33rd Battalion, disobeyed orders to return home and volunteered his battalion to lead the evacuation effort. Some labeled them traitors; others proclaimed them heroes. Nevertheless, the Damned 33rd headed for Dubai and orchestrated a convoy to take people out of the city. But then the storms hit. Furious sandstorms with wind speeds over 80 mph ravaged the Persian Gulf surrounding Dubai, essentially creating a wall around the city. No radio signal could get in or out of the city and no vehicle could get close enough to provide aid. Worst of all, Konrad, the Damned 33rd and the convoy had vanished, never surfacing from the sandstorms.</p><p style="">Six months later, the Pentagon picks up a distress beacon from just outside Dubai transmitting a message from Konrad declaring the evacuation a failure. Delta Squad, a three-man elite operatives team comprised of Capt. <a href="/martin-walker/3005-13723/" data-ref-id="3005-13723">Martin Walker</a>, 1st. Lt. <a href="/adams/3005-23592/" data-ref-id="3005-23592">Alphanso Adams</a> and SSgt. <a href="/lugo/3005-23591/" data-ref-id="3005-23591">John Lugo</a>, is sent to Dubai to locate the source of the signal transmitting the first message out of the city since the storms hit. Their mission is to survey the damage done to the city and locate survivors, then leave the city and get to a location where contact can be made with headquarters. Walker has a special interest in locating survivors from the Damned 33rd - he served under and had his life saved by Konrad during a mission in Kabul that went awry.</p><p style="">Delta Squad pushes through the raging wall of sandstorms surrounding the city to find Dubai buried under sand, with buildings torn to shreds by the storms. After finding the beacon transmitting Konrad's message in the outskirts of the city, Walker and his team are attacked by insurgents, survivors of the storms that are killing soldiers on sight. Delta Squad fights their way through several insurgent attacks before picking up a message from a nearby group of 33rd troops under fire nearby. Walker decides to delay calling for backup briefly to respond to the cry for help. After a tense firefight with insurgents on a crashed airplane, Delta Squad finds all but one soldier dead. The badly wounded soldier asks them to save his squadmate who has been taken by the insurgents to their nest in an abandoned hotel, but dies before he is able to tell Walker where Konrad is. Agreeing that the soldier needs their help, Walker and his men venture after him.</p><p style="">Soon after, Walker, Adams and Lugo unwittingly find themselves caught in the crossfire of a civil war between the Damned 33rd - who turned on Konrad and themselves, and its remnants are now spoken for by a pirate radio DJ and former journalist known only as <a href="/the-radioman/3005-23594/" data-ref-id="3005-23594">The Radioman</a> - and an insurgent civilian uprising aided by the CIA. The two sides had previously agreed to a cease-fire that was broken as Delta Squad arrived. Delta Squad reluctantly sides with the CIA, believing that the Damned 33rd has gone rogue based on their rounding up citizens who surrender to them. (Walker fears, based on Delta Squad's observations at an emergency shelter known as The Nest, that the Damned 33rd will kill the rounded-up prisoners.) Though Lugo and Adams beg Walker to call for support, he takes them further into the city, convinced to find Konrad and evacuate the remaining survivors.</p><p style="">After surviving ambushes by the Damned 33rd and discovering plans found on a fallen CIA agent, Walker and his men reach a 33rd Outpost known as The Gate. Unable to fight their way to the heavily guarded entrance, Delta Squad discovers an abandoned mortar loaded with <a href="/white-phosphorus/3055-5718/" data-ref-id="3055-5718">white phosphorus</a>, a highly corrosive chemical compound that the 33rd has used on its enemies to burn them alive. Despite Lugo's objections, Walker and Adams posit that they have no choice but to use the weapon against the Damned 33rd. The attack obliterates the base and wipes out the company. However, Delta Squad woefully finds more victims among the charred remains of the base: 47 civilians taken by the Damned 33rd from The Nest to protect them during the battles against the insurgents. Lugo flies off the handle, damning Walker for making them murderers by refusing to leave Dubai. Walker seems unable to cope with what he's done at first before insisting they press onward. Seemingly blaming The Radioman and his control over the 33rd for necessitating the attack, Walker insists to make him pay.</p><p style="">Inside the Gate, Walker discovers a radio through which Konrad, seemingly waiting for them to find the corpses of his executed "loyalists," speaks to him. Konrad reveals to Walker that he has been in charge the entire time, using the Radioman as his mouthpiece. As Delta Squad presses forward, they learn more of Konrad's control over Dubai: after his evacuation failed, Konrad imposed martial law over the city, engaging in population control and death by torture for the smallest crimes. Though now wanted by the Damned 33rd for murdering the civilians at the Gate and in spite of Lugo and Adams' increasing concerns over his mental state, Walker urges his team towards the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in Dubai and Konrad's most logical vantage point.</p><p style="">Roaming deeper into the city, Delta Squad finds a CIA stronghold and Agent Riggs, the last surviving operative. Riggs convinces Delta to help in his mission to steal Dubai's remaining water from the Aquatic Colosseum, a maneuver he assures them will cripple the 33rd's power and bring peace to the city. Delta handily subdues the forces protecting the Colosseum, but the trucks with the stolen water remain under constant retaliation from the Damned 33rd. With the escape failing, Riggs intentionally crashes the truck, knocking Walker unconscious. When he awakens, he sees the charred wreck of the trucks pouring water into the sands, and Riggs mortally wounded under the wreckage. Though he dies, his mission was a success: with no water, the residents of Dubai will soon die of dehydration and all witnesses of Konrad and the 33rd's war crimes erased, thus preventing an international relations disaster that would lead to, in Riggs' words, the entire Arab world declaring war on the United States. Thanks to Walker, Dubai has less than four days left before everyone dies.</p><p style="">Walker reunites with Lugo and Adams in a mall, where the Damned 33rd attempt to take them captive before Walker intervenes. The trio, much worse for the wear after everything that has happened, battles their way out of the mall while the Radioman eggs on the 33rd and chastises Delta Squad at every turn, damning them for the murders at the Gate while defeding Konrad's actions as doing "what he had to do." Delta's new objective becomes clear: Take out the Radioman and use his makeshift radio tower in the Trans-Emirates Building to broadcast an evacuation plan to the remaining survivors. Fighting through scores of soldiers and a couple inexplicable hallucinations, Walker leads the storming of the radio tower where a calm, collected Radioman surrenders and offers to help set up the signal for the 33rd. Lugo then shoots the Radioman several times, killing him, as retribution for sending endless soldiers in pursuit of them. As Walker begins broadcasting his evacuation notice - while Konrad mocks him for thinking his evacuation attempts would go any differently - reinforcements arrive via Black Hawk. Adams commandeers the Black Hawk and the trio use it to kill the remaining attackers, destroying the radio tower in the process. Under pursuit by the 33rd's remaining squadron of attack helicopters, Walker orders them to fly into a sandstorm for cover, where a 33rd helicopter collides with them.</p><p style="">A disoriented, hallucinating Walker wakes up some distance from the crash site, separated from his team. He reconvenes with Adams at the crash site, and the two fight their way behind enemy lines to rescue Lugo. But they are too late - Lugo is lynched by a civilian mob furious over the Americans destroying the water. Though Adams blames Walker for Lugo's death, the duo presses onwards in one final push towards Konrad's headquarters, vowing that Konrad must be killed. Their suicide mission into the Damned 33rd's last remaining stronghold goes well until Delta Squad is surrounded. Walker attempts to surrender but Adams, having lost the will to live, pushes Walker towards escape and makes one final stand against the Damned 33rd. Walker runs away towards the Burj Khalifa when an explosion from behind him, one that presumably kills Adams, knocks him unconscious.</p><p style="">Walker awakens outside the Burj Khalifa. Inside, a team of soldiers who claims to be the last of the 33rd (and wearing similar uniforms as the dead soldiers found inside the Gate) surrenders Dubai to Walker and tells him that Konrad is where he has always been: upstairs, waiting for Walker. Upon reaching Konrad's penthouse, Walker has a disturbing revelation - Konrad has been dead the entire time. Walker, desperate to be a hero and unable to cope with the events at the Gate, hallucinated Konrad speaking to him through a broken radio and several other events; his refusal to obey orders has cost him the lives of Dubai's 5,000 survivors and his two partners in Delta Squad. Konrad gives Walker one final choice: shoot Konrad, and continue to blame him for the events, or turn the gun on himself and pay for his crimes.</p><h2>Development</h2><p style="">Spec Ops: The Line was first revealed in an exclusive trailer aired during the <a href="/spike-video-game-awards-2009/3015-5568/" data-ref-id="3015-5568">2009 Spike Video Game Awards</a>. The evocative trailer, which gave the first glimpses of the game's premise set to Bjork's "Storm," received plenty of positive buzz and was considered one of the highlights of the show. The Line was first announced for a <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2009/12/14/spec-ops-the-line-not-dusting-up-until-nov-2010-at-earliest/" rel="nofollow">2010 release,</a> but was ultimately delayed several times, first being <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2010/06/11/xcom-spec-ops-the-line-opt-for-2011-release/" rel="nofollow">pushed back to 2011</a> and then to June 26, 2012. <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2010/07/22/spec-ops-the-line-beta-invites-going-out-to-a-small-number-of/" rel="nofollow">In 2010 beta invitations went out to fans</a> around the world featuring several multiplayer maps and modes. The Multiplayer Only beta received an update midway through that added a few extra modes and various gameplay and graphics improvements. The beta has since been discontinued and simply gives an error message upon startup.

The first thing players will notice when starting a RTTS  (Road to The Show) career is the player creation has improved. Now you  can find even more options for players who want to truly customize their  on field superstars. The drill system has also been improved. Now  players can find specific drills for catchers and pitchers in the  practice modes and improve their skills with their respective players  even more. The progression of the mode has also been tweaked. Instead of  players starting out playing spring training against MLB players, they  will start out directly in the Double A season and work up to an invite  to Spring Training. These enhancements will make it easier for new  players to get into the game, and veterans will have time to hone their  skills before starting the season. <br/> <br/><h3>Catcher Mode<br/></h3>In Road to the Show mode, an enhanced catcher position is available to play.  The new catcher mode allows players to choose the pitches and their locations behind the mound.  In this mode, the player has a first-person perspective behind the mound, immersing the player into the catcher position.  Playing as the catcher allows players to further manage the game by picking off base runners and fielding the ball.  As the catcher, calling a quality start or picking off base runners will reward the player with experience points.  Being able to play as a catcher and perform all of the duties of a catcher greatly enhances the realism of this game. <br/> <br/><h3>Classic Stadiums<br/></h3> Given out as a pre-order bonus was a code for a Classic Stadium pack that included Crosley Field, Forbes Field, Griffith Stadium, Polo Grounds, Shibe Park, and Sportsman's Park.  These stadiums could be later purchased as downloadable content from the Playstation Store.<br/><h3><br/></h3><h3>Other New Modes and Features</h3>Other  new modes for the game help enhance the experience even more.<br/> <ul class="plain-list"><li>Players can now play the Home Run Derby as a standalone mode or as  part of the All Star Break</li><li>New Stadiums</li><li>New gameplay and presentation animations<br/></li><li>Customize the fan chants and game audio</li><li>Full online league support</li><li>New movie maker feature to allow more diverse editing of replays  and clips</li><li>Online game history</li><li>New camera system</li><li>More details in visuals</li></ul>  <br/><h2>Team Rankings</h2> All 30 MLB teams are ranked in-game on 4 separate categories: Overall, Batting, Pitching, Defense.   <br/> <br/><table class="t-editor with-border full-width"><tbody><tr><th>Overall Ranking</th><th>Batting Ranking</th><th>Pitching Ranking</th><th>Defense Ranking</th></tr><tr><td> 1.

He speaks in very simple language, using vocabulary that one might find in a children's book, to describe Naughty Bear's violent actions.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Gameplay requires the player to lead the single minded and sociopathic Naughty Bear on his personal quest to bring about brutal <a href="/revenge/3015-1363/" data-ref-id="3015-1363">revenge</a> against his elitist teddy neighbors.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Naughty Bear starts each level at his shack where he must score a certain number of Naughty points to advance to the main level. Naughty points are awarded for anything and everything a player does; more points are awarded for creativity and variety . The game gives players a <a href="/multiplier/3015-805/" data-ref-id="3015-805">multiplier</a> bar which multiplies the player's points and allows combos to be performed (the score can be multiplied up to 100). The multiplier rises when players perform feats of 'Naughtiness'. The only way to score a high score is to constantly keep the multiplier high. When players start a level, the game provides a precise set of objectives; such as 'kill all the bears in the area' or 'don't let any of them escape'. The game also gives the player random <a href="/collectibles/3015-375/" data-ref-id="3015-375">collectibles</a> to search for (these are optional) such as <a href="/present/3055-1291/" data-ref-id="3055-1291">presents</a> or cursed pages. By finding and destroying these, players keep their multiplier high. Players also can pick up a freeze bonus, which freezes the multiplier, stopping it from going down for a set period of time but also boosting it.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Naughty Bear has a life bar situated on the top left corner of the screen. Once this bar depletes or an objective is failed, it's game over. Players can replenish their health by finding <a href="/cake/3055-56/" data-ref-id="3055-56">cake</a>.</p><figure style="width: 960px" data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39063/1417826-screen15_1024x768.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1417826" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.56470588235294" data-width="960" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39063/1417826-screen15_1024x768.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1417826"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/3/39063/1417826-screen15_1024x768.jpg"></a></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Naughty Bear has different tools at his disposal to terrorize and kill the bears of Paradise Island. Naughty can find many weapons such as <a href="/club/3055-725/" data-ref-id="3055-725">clubs</a>, knives, and <a href="/stick/3055-539/" data-ref-id="3055-539">sticks</a>. He can also shoot a <a href="/gun/3055-118/" data-ref-id="3055-118">gun</a>. He has the choice between a <a href="/magnum/3055-1823/" data-ref-id="3055-1823">magnum revolver</a> or a <a href="/machine-gun/3055-608/" data-ref-id="3055-608">machine gun</a>. When aiming, the camera takes an <a href="/over-the-shoulder/3015-2621/" data-ref-id="3015-2621">over the shoulder</a> view.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Naughty can also place <a href="/traps/3015-609/" data-ref-id="3015-609">traps -</a> bear traps and land mines. When a bear steps on a <a href="/anti-personnel-mine/3055-1412/" data-ref-id="3055-1412">land mine</a>, he also traps himself; if he takes his foot off it, it blows up.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Naughty can also use his growl; this serves to scare the other bears, lure them into a trap, or make them run away.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">There are over 250 crimes and misdemeanors for Naughty Bear to commit on his rampage across the Island of Perfection. The naughtiness ranges from the likes of <a href="/graffiti/3015-208/" data-ref-id="3015-208">graffiti</a> to gangland executions and includes altogether more sinister acts, such as domestic sabotage and using the desperate cries of trapped teddies to lure out the more altruistic bears, creating plenty of easy targets. The bears have can also sabotage various objects, however, this leaves them vulnerable.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Players can also wound bears, at which point, they're unable to walk correctly; this usually happens after a trap. Players can perform Ultimate Kills on wounded bears, these differ based on the situation and the weapon used. For example, if Naughty executes an Ultimate Kill on a bear who's trying to fix a phone, Naughty will take the phone, bash the bear in the face with it, then stick the phone down its throat. Players can also perform Ultimate Scares. These work similarly to Ultimate Kills, except that the target bear must first become <a href="/insanity/3015-1503/" data-ref-id="3015-1503">insane</a>. Once a bear is insane, he'll walk around the level aimlessly with bubbles floating over his head; if one more scare is performed on this victim, they will take whichever weapon they have in their hand and kill themselves with it.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">NPCs work as a team, and each group has a leader (the one with the hat). They investigate suspicious behaviors, such as the power cutting out; they barricade themselves in; try to escape by <a href="/car/3055-322/" data-ref-id="3055-322">car</a> or by <a href="/boat/3055-804/" data-ref-id="3055-804">boat</a> (both of which can be destroyed by Naughty); and can call in the cops, <a href="/ninja/3015-12/" data-ref-id="3015-12">ninjas</a>, or the military. They wield guns and other weapons, which they find on the ground, in the <a href="/refrigerator/3055-1685/" data-ref-id="3055-1685">fridge</a>, or in picnic baskets. They can fix things and run after the player. Players can set traps or use environmental methods to deal with NPCs.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The game's <a href="/heads-up-display/3015-180/" data-ref-id="3015-180">HUD</a> tells Naughty Bear where to go. The green arrow pointing from Naughty's feet indicate where his main objective is. Usually this arrow appears after having accomplished all the level's objectives, highlighting the exit. The red arrow appears when one of the other teddies is doing something (escaping, calling for help, etc.). A pop-up window will appear when an NPC is doing something important. This pop-up window will show the offending bear; if it is calling for help or escaping, a timer appears.</p><h2>Costumes</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">By winning cups or completing levels, players can unlock <a href="/alternate-costumes/3015-583/" data-ref-id="3015-583">costumes</a>. These costumes have different effects on Naughty. Some just boost his <a href="/attributes/3015-1681/" data-ref-id="3015-1681">statistics,</a> like <a href="/super-strength/3015-1114/" data-ref-id="3015-1114">strength</a> or speed. Others make him disguise himself as an ally, giving him more time to sabotage things. He can also disguise himself as certain characters.

This means that players have to use scare tactics to drive them insane and use traps. The level ends once all the bears are dead.</p><h3>Insanity</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Players must drive the bears insane. No bears must escape and players may only kill them once they are insane. This means that players have to resort to scare tactics and sabotage.</p><h3>Invisibility</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Players must run around the map without being seen more than five times. This type of challenge demands <a href="/stealth/3015-24/" data-ref-id="3015-24">stealth</a> and quick kills.</p><h3>Killer</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Players must kill all the bears without letting a single one escape.</p><h3>Speed Run</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Players must go through an entire level before time runs out.</p><h3>Untouchable</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Players mustn't get hit once while taking out the bears.</p><h2>Different types of Bears</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The game sports a variety of bears that each have their own characteristics:</p><h3 style="margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;">Fluffy, Stardust, Twinkles, and Sunbeam</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">These are the regular bears. They chase after the player with weapons such as clubs and <a href="/ham/3055-3715/" data-ref-id="3055-3715">ham</a>. Players can scare them and make them go insane with relative ease; they cannot go into the forest, so they're easy to hide from. When they call for help, they call for the cops.</p><h3 style="margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;">Bears with Hats</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">These bears usually where a party hat or a <a href="/top-hat/3055-1739/" data-ref-id="3055-1739">top hat</a>.

In Gestalt, <a data-ref-id="3005-14309" href="/nier/3005-14309/">Nier</a> is an older man who tries to save his daughter Yonah from a mysterious illness. In Replicant, Nier appears signficantly younger, and Yonah is his younger sister<i>.</i></p><p style="">Beyond these key differences, Nier Replicant is almost identical to Gestalt in both story and gameplay.

On January 11th, 2013, the online servers for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the original game were shut down.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">NBA Jam is a fast-pace arcade style 2-on-2 basketball game that plays very similarly to the 1993 arcade game of the same name. Their are no fouls in NBA Jam other than goal tending (interfering with the ball when it is on the way to the basket) and shot clock violation (24 second shot clock expires before a shot is taken). Since their are only those two fouls, players have the ability to shove their opponents in an attempt to jar the basketball loose. In order to counter this, a new spin move has been added to the series. If the player spins just as they are about to be shoved they will spin out of the shove causing the opposing player to stagger over. Another new offensive move added to the series is a crossover move. A successful counter will cause the opponent to stagger for a moment giving the player a chance to score a bucket. Players also have the ability to perform alley-oops by passing the ball to an airborne teammate or by going up for an alley-oop themselves and having their teammate pass it to them.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1987786-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1987786" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.615" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:61.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1987786-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1987786"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1987786-1.jpg"></a><figcaption>Trail of fire</figcaption></figure><p style="">If the player manages to score 3 times in a row they will become "on fire" (points scored via goal tending violations do not count). When on fire the player has unlimited turbo, better shot making ability, and the ability to perform gravity defying dunks. The only way to put out an opposing players fire is by scoring a bucket (scoring via a goal tending violation will not put out an opposing players fire). If the players on fire status has not been put out after 5 possessions, it will automatically go out.</p><p style=""><b>Game Types</b></p><p style="">In addition to the classic 2v2 game, several new modes have been added including 21, Smash, Domination, Elimination and 2v2 Remix. Classic Campaign only features the classic 2v2 game while Remix Tour features the other game types.</p><p style="">In 21 the player is stacked up against 1 to 3 <a href="/artificial-intelligence/3015-218/" data-ref-id="3015-218">AI</a> opponents in a race to 21 points. Only half the court is used and the perspective changes from a sideline view to a view positioned at the players back. The first player to reach 21 points wins the game. It also is make it take it, meaning the last player to score gets the ball back.</p><p style="">In Smash the object of the game is to weaken the opposing teams backboard by performing dunks and alley-oops. Regular shots also do damage, but the damage is minimal. Each successful dunk, alley-oop or shot takes life off of the opposing teams backboard. Once the opponents backboard's life meter is completely empty, the backboard's glass shatters and the game ends with the player who shattered the backboard winning the game. The killing blow to the backboard must be a dunk or an alley-oop and not a lay-up or a jump shot.</p><p style="">In Domination the object of the game is to gain spots on the court by scoring a basket while standing inside the spot. As in 21, the game is played half court with the camera to the players back and the game can be played in teams of 2 or free-for-all. There are five spots on the court: 4 placed on the three point line and 1 in the "paint". Once a player has control of a spot they continually gain points from it until either the opposing player takes the spot or the spot expires after a certain period of time. The first team or player to reach 100 points wins the game.</p><p style="">Elimination is similar to 21 in many aspects, the only difference is that now the objective is to be the last man standing. The game is played in rounds, each round ends after a set period of time and the player with the lowest score is eliminated. This continues until only 1 player is left and that player wins the game. If 2 players tie for the lowest score then they both are eliminated.</p><p style="">2v2 Remix is identical to classic 2v2 except that it contains <a href="/power-up/3015-700/" data-ref-id="3015-700">power-ups</a>. Power-ups can provide benefits such as increasing the players speed or strength. However, one power-up shrinks the player having a negative impact on their ability to make shots. Power-ups randomly show up on the court and can be collected by simply walking over them.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1987783-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1987783" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.64316239316239" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:64.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1987783-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1987783"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1987783-1.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1987783-1.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Magic Johnson boss battle</figcaption></figure><p style=""><b>Campaigns</b></p><p style="">NBA Jam features two different campaign modes, Classic Campaign and Remix Tour. Classic Campaign is similar to the older NBA Jam games, it pits the player against all NBA teams (except for the team chosen by the player to avoid the same team playing against itself). In addition to the games against NBA teams, their are also legend battles which pits the player against former NBA legends. Beating the legends unlocks them as playable characters.</p><p style="">Remix Tour has the player traveling through divisions defeating NBA teams in the various game types in order to earn trophies. Each NBA team has a bronze, silver, and gold trophy associated with them. Beating the team once earns the bronze trophy, twice the silver, and three times the gold. Remix Mode also features boss battles which puts the player up against a recognizable NBA star that has been given super-human or super-natural abilities. For example, in the boss battle with <a href="/magic-johnson/3005-6543/" data-ref-id="3005-6543">Magic Johnson</a>, Magic Johnson has the ability to <a href="/teleportation/3015-8/" data-ref-id="3015-8">teleport</a> around the court making him very hard to guard. After the player has earned all the trophies from all the NBA teams and after the credits have finished, they will enter one last game against The Beastie Boys in a game of 21. Defeating them unlocks them as playable characters</p><h2>Standard Roster</h2><p style="">The standard roster for NBA Jam includes the 30 standard teams from the 2010-2011 NBA season. Unlike the original <a href="/nba-jam/3030-16928/" data-ref-id="3030-16928">NBA Jam</a>, in which teams are divided in the Team Selection Screen into Eastern and Western conferences, this installment lists all teams alphabetically. Each team has 3-4 standard players, and most teams have additional <a href="/unlockables/3015-1414/" data-ref-id="3015-1414">unlockable</a> "legends" (Former NBA players).</p><table><tbody><tr><td><h3><a href="/atlanta-hawks/3015-5202/" data-ref-id="3015-5202"><b>Atlanta Hawks</b></a></h3><figure data-align="right"

Unlike the smaller DLC-content packages, this expansion is a direct continuation of the main Dragon Age: Origins story.

However, you can always continue your Origins storyline by loading from an old save.

They use close range area of effect spells that either deal damage or function as crowd control.</li><li><b>Keeper</b> - A Druidic specialization with a strong focus on nature oriented spells, such as tree branches bursting out of the mage &amp; inflicting damage upon their unlucky foes.</li></ul><h3><a data-ref-id="3015-4313" href="/re-spec/3015-4313/"><b>Re-Spec</b></a></h3><p style="">Players will have access to new tomes called "Manual of Focus" that will allow them to re-spend all of their points at any time. This includes everything from attribute points, skills, talents, spells and specializations. It's a way to give old players access to new specializations and abilities without forcing them to start a whole new character. It can also be used to re-spec party members, allowing players to fully customize their party to their play style instead of building around the default specializations. These tomes can be purchased from Herren (another returning Origins NPC) for 6 gold each.</p><h2>Companions</h2><table class="t-editor full-width with-out-border"><tbody><tr><th>Character</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/1261692-anders7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1261692" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.91370558375635" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:91.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/1261692-anders7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1261692"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/30036/1261692-anders7.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/30036/1261692-anders7.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>"I didn't do it!"</figcaption></figure></td><td><b>Character Bio</b><br /><b>Full Name</b>: <a href="/">Anders</a><br /><b>Race</b>: Human<br /><b>Gender</b>: Male<br /><b>Class</b>: Mage<br /><b>Specialization</b>: Spirit Healer<br /><br /><b>Overview</b>: A talented mage and a bit of a troublemaker.

The show starts at 4:30pm Eastern, live on ESPN, and will last for three-hours.</p><h2>New Features</h2><p style="">Madden NFL 11 is integrating a <a href="http://maddennfl.easports.com/blog.action?blogId=locomotion" rel="nofollow">motion engine</a> based on the one used in FIFA 10. This engine is called locomotion and deals with speed, acceleration, and, agility. Player movement will be more responsive and based off of acceleration, momentum, and direction. The Madden NFL development team did a <a href="http://www.coveritlive.com/index2.php/option=com_altcaster/task=viewaltcast/altcast_code=acf65c8409/template=easportsmaddennfl001/width=640/height=800" rel="nofollow">live chat</a> on the new locomotion engine.</p><blockquote><p style="">The Madden NFL development team said,"The big 3 for locomotion are Speed, Accel, and Agility. Agility is the most important rating for changing of directions, followed closely by Acceleration (need to get back up to speed after slowing down to cut or turn at high speed). If I had to rank them I'd put Speed and Accel roughly even with Agility close behind. Last year Accel and Agility weren't on the same planet as speed. :)</p></blockquote><p style="">From early gameplay footage the new Locomotion engine appears to have fixed a few flaws present in older Maddens. Lineman no longer teleport to predetermined locations and no longer get stuck into "suction" blocking. Because of the addition of speed, acceleration, and agility rating linemen seem to actually plant their legs and be forced to move around the pocket that way.</p><p style=""><a href="http://maddennfl.easports.com/blog.action?blogId=CatchTuning" rel="nofollow">Catching</a> has been tuned to fix bugs in previous versions where receivers would run backwards, not recognize the sideline, or make no attempt to stay in bounds on a touchdown catch. The Madden NFL development team did a <a href="http://www.coveritlive.com/index2.php/option=com_altcaster/task=viewaltcast/altcast_code=6ccbb416b2/template=easportsmaddennfl001/width=640/height=800" rel="nofollow">live chat</a> on the tuning made to catching.</p><p style="">The debut trailer was released at midnight on Thursday, April 22, 2010 on Spike TV after the first round of the 2010 NFL Draft. With the mantra, "Simpler, Quicker, Deeper" the video revealed GameFlow, an all-new play-calling system similar to what an NFL quarterback would experience in a real game. GameFlow is intended to keep players in the action for as long as possible, reducing time spent in the playbook and enabling players to complete games quicker. GameFlow is however a very deep system as players can fully customize sets of plays to use during online or offline games. Players can also rate their favorite plays up to 5 stars(think iTunes) to make creating their favorite sets of plays easier. During the game coaches will instruct the player on what play is being run through their headset. The game will not simply state the name of the play like "X,Y,Z Flex" but instead will instruct the player on what to expect. For example "the TE will cut across the middle of the field after 15 yards, try to read the linebacker to see if he is covered".</p><p style="">The most drastic change is the removal of the Turbo button; a long standing tradition of the Madden franchise. A player will always attempt to run at top speed when the play dictates it. A players ability to outrun defenders or find the hole is entirely based off of their new ratings instead of the holding down of an arbitrary "accelerator". The Turbo button can be turned back on in the options.</p><p style="">Dual Stick Control switches over controls for all juke moves to the right analog stick instead of face buttons; all juke moves are analog and based off of the amount of pressure applied to the right stick.

Here players begin as an up-and-coming DJ who travels the road. If player is successful enough, they can eventually become the head of their own entertainment empire.   It also allows the player to compete in battles between both real DJs, and the fictional characters native to the series, in addition to the various setlists, mega-mixes, and bonus setlists that the player can compete in.<br/> <br/><h3>Freestyle</h3> DJ Hero 2 introduces freestyle scratching and crossfading.  During these sections of the mixes the player will play through, he or she will be able to crossfade between the two tracks and/or scratch as they please. <br/> <br/><h3>Contextual Samples</h3>Rather than simply having canned samples appropriate for all tracks, DJ Hero 2 will also have samples available to the player that have been extracted from the songs being mashed up. For example, in the "Regulate"/"Hot in Herre" mix, a sample of <a data-ref-id="3005-4146" href="/warren-g/3005-4146/" slug="warren-g">                                        Warren G</a>'s voice is available. It also allows the player to compete in battles between both real DJs, and the fictional characters native to the series.<br/> <br/><b><h3>Microphone Compatibility / Expanded Multiplayer </h3></b>DJ Hero 2 allows for vocalists to enter the fray more than ever. While the original game featured microphone support, players were only able to freestyle/talk/yell over the music. This year's rendition introduces on-screen vocals, allowing for players to sing and rap along to the lyrics. <br/> <br/>Improved Microphone Support is just one of the ways multiplayer as been expanded In DJ Hero 2. DJ Battles return, but have unique mixes specially tuned for battle gameplay. Here, players perform alternating song sections, with the winner being the most accurate of the two. <i>Accumulator</i> has players racing to fill an on screen bar by getting high note streaks. Party Play (as introduced in <a data-ref-id="3030-24711" href="/guitar-hero-5/3030-24711/" slug="guitar-hero-5">                                                                 Guitar Hero 5</a>) also makes a comeback, allowing players to build a custom setlist and both DJs and Vocalists to jump in or out of  song at anytime.<br/> <br/> <h2>Soundtrack<br/></h2>DJ Hero 2's soundtrack is once again supporting mashups of "the hottest tracks" from "the biggest artists". This year's setlist sees over 80 new mashups that include over 100 artists. Players should note that a number of mixes can only be played in the game's DJ Battle Multiplayer mode.<br/>  <br/><i>Produced and mixed by A-Trak</i> <br/><ul class="plain-list"><li>Justice - "D.A.N.C.E."

These special setlists are reminiscent to the encore songs found in the <a data-ref-id="3025-289" href="/guitar-hero/3025-289/" slug="guitar-hero">     Guitar Hero</a> series, which involve specialized introductions to the songs (for example, Deadmau5 is shown to put on his mousehead as opposed to simply walking to his turntables). <br/> <br/>Joining the guests DJs are fictional characters created by <a data-ref-id="3010-4343" href="/freestylegames-ltd/3010-4343/" slug="freestylegames-ltd">  FreeStyleGames</a>. Most of the fictional DJs from the previous installment return (such as Jugglernort and Mixy Trix), as well as created characters that are new to the series. Xbox 360 players may also use their Xbox Avatar as playable characters as well.<i><br/></i><h2>Bundles<br/></h2>DJ Hero 2 is available for purchase in two different bundles. <b>The Party Bundle</b> includes a copy of the game, two turntable controllers as well as a microphone. <b>The Turntable Bundle</b> is simply one turntable controller with a copy of the game.

One such change is the addition of "True aim" which will replace the old circle aiming system with simply the general direction the shot will go. Also gone is the camera following the ball flight. This will now be a stationary camera that remains behind the golfer showing only what would normally be seen on the golf course. The Ryder Cup has been added to the game as well featuring the typical setup seen in the real world with 12 vs.12 team play. </p><p style=""> </p><h2>Playstation Move</h2><p style="">After the <a href="/playstation-move/3000-36/" data-ref-id="3000-36">PlayStation Move's</a> launch, PGA Tour 11 received an update making it compatible with Move. Move allows for 1:1 swings and tilting the controller lets you change the way you take your shot. </p><p style="">A demo of the game is available on the Move's demo disk.</p><p style=""> </p><h2>Golfers</h2><p style=""> </p><h3>Male</h3><p style=""> </p><ul><li><a href="/tiger-woods/3005-18/" data-ref-id="3005-18"> Tiger Woods</a></li><li><a href="/rory-mcilroy/3005-11306/" data-ref-id="3005-11306"> Rory Mcilroy</a></li><li><a href="/chris-dimarco/3005-11299/" data-ref-id="3005-11299"> Chris DiMarco</a></li><li><a href="/luke-donald/3005-11300/" data-ref-id="3005-11300"> Luke Donald</a></li><li><a href="/jim-furyk/3005-11302/" data-ref-id="3005-11302"> Jim Furyk</a></li><li><a href="/retief-goosen/3005-11303/" data-ref-id="3005-11303"> Retief Goosen</a></li><li><a href="/colin-montgomerie/3005-11307/" data-ref-id="3005-11307"> Colin Montgomerie</a></li><li><a href="/ian-poulter/3005-11352/" data-ref-id="3005-11352"> Ian Poulter</a></li><li><a href="/justin-rose/3005-11354/" data-ref-id="3005-11354"> Justin Rose</a></li><li><a href="/adam-scott/3005-11355/" data-ref-id="3005-11355"> Adam Scott</a></li><li><a href="/vijay-singh/3005-11356/" data-ref-id="3005-11356"> Vijay Singh</a></li><li><a href="/mike-weir/3005-8458/" data-ref-id="3005-8458"> Mike Weir</a></li><li><a href="/michael-campbell/3005-11296/" data-ref-id="3005-11296"> Michael Campbell</a></li><li><a href="/camilo-villegas/3005-11358/" data-ref-id="3005-11358"> Camilo Villegas</a></li><li><a href="/darren-clarke/3005-11297/" data-ref-id="3005-11297"> Darren Clarke</a></li><li><a href="/paul-casey/3005-11608/" data-ref-id="3005-11608"> Paul Casey</a></li><li><a href="/nick-dougherty/3005-11301/" data-ref-id="3005-11301"> Nick Dougherty</a></li><li><a href="/anthony-kim/3005-10955/" data-ref-id="3005-10955"> Anthony Kim</a></li><li><a href="/rocco-mediate/3005-11295/" data-ref-id="3005-11295"> Rocco Mediate</a></li><li>Stephen Ames</li><li>Danny Lee</li><li>Boo Weekley</li></ul><p style=""> </p><p style=""> </p><h3>Female</h3><p style=""> </p><ul><li><a href="/paula-creamer/3005-11298/" data-ref-id="3005-11298"> Paula Creamer</a></li><li><a href="/christie-kerr/3005-11305/" data-ref-id="3005-11305"> Cristie Kerr</a></li><li><a href="/morgan-pressel/3005-11353/" data-ref-id="3005-11353"> Morgan Pressel</a></li><li><a href="/natalie-gulbis/3005-11304/" data-ref-id="3005-11304"> Natalie Gulbis</a></li><li>Suzanne Petterson </li></ul><p style=""> </p><p style=""> </p><h3>Fantasy </h3><p style=""> </p><ul><li>Raczilla</li><li>Angus MacLeary</li><li>Travis Knox</li><li>Elsa Bjorklund</li><li>Bobbie Leigh</li></ul><p style=""> </p><h2>Xbox 360 &amp; PS3 Course List</h2><p style=""> </p><ul><li><a href="/tpc-sawgrass/3035-1081/" data-ref-id="3035-1081"> TPC Sawgrass</a> </li><li>Turnberry </li><li>St. Andrews </li><li>Bethpage State Park </li><li>Oakmont CC </li><li>Wentworth </li><li><a href="/pebble-beach-golf-links/3035-3033/" data-ref-id="3035-3033"> Pebble Beach</a> </li><li>TPC Boston </li><li>Hazeltine </li><li>East Lake </li><li>Torrey Pines </li><li>Wolf Creek </li><li>Celtic Manor Resort </li><li>Liberty National </li><li>The Greenbrier </li><li>TPC Scottsdale </li><li>Whistling Straits </li></ul><p style=""> </p><p style=""> </p><h3>DLC Courses for Xbox 360 &amp; PS3 </h3><p style=""> </p><ul><li>Pinehurst™ No. 2 </li><li>Sheshan Golf &amp; CC </li><li>Harbour Town Golf Links </li><li>Gary Player Country Club Course </li><li>Bay Hill Club &amp; Lodge® </li><li>TPC Blue Monster at Doral® </li><li>Cog Hill Golf &amp; CC™ </li><li>Banff Springs </li><li>Firestone CC </li><li>Spyglass Hill® Golf Club </li><li>Riviera CC (Gamestop Pre-order Bonus)</li><li>The Predator </li><li>Highlands </li><li>River Course at Blackwolf Run </li><li>Emerald Dragon</li></ul><p style=""> </p><h2>Wii Course List</h2><p style=""> </p><ul><li>Celtic Manor Resort (The Twenty Ten Course) </li><li>The Greenbrier (The Old White Course) </li><li>Liberty National G.C. </li><li>Whistling Straits (Straits Course) </li><li>The Predator (Fantasy Course) </li><li>Banff Springs (Stanley Thompson 18) </li><li>Bay Hill Club &amp; Lodge </li><li>Bethpage (Black) </li><li>Cog Hill Golf &amp; CC (Dubsdread Course) </li><li>Doral (Blue Monster) </li><li>East Lake C.C. </li><li>Gary Player C.C. </li><li>Harbor Town Golf Links </li><li>Hazeltine National C.C. </li><li>Kiawah Island Golf Resort (Ocean Course) </li><li>Oakmont C.C. </li><li>Pebble Beach Golf Links </li><li>Pinehurst (Course #2) </li><li>Sheshan Golf Club </li><li>Saint Andrews Links (Old Course) </li><li>The K Club Golf Resort </li><li>Torrey Pines G.C.

While the yearly soccer game focuses more on club teams, the FIFA World Cup video games' attention shifts to the actual competition itself. Even though only 32 teams make it through to the group stages, EA has managed to bring in almost all of the nations that have taken part in the qualification stages as well.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1379/1264588-5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1264588" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1379/1264588-5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1264588"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1379/1264588-5.jpg"></a><figcaption>The FIFA World Cup Trophy</figcaption></figure><p style="">The World Cup is one of the most anticipated sporting events around the world, and it's no surprise that a game like this would garner so much hype. This year, the competition is to be held in South Africa in June, and all 32 teams that have qualified are ready to compete on the world's grandest stage and attempt to win the FIFA World Cup Trophy.</p><p style="">The graphics engine for <a href="/fifa-10/3030-26702/" data-ref-id="3030-26702">FIFA 10</a> has been improved and features a new lighting model to give a more natural looking pitch. The visuals have also been changed to reflect the unique atmosphere of the World Cup. Confetti and streamers will appear on the pitch and crowds have been more accurately modeled featuring novelty dress and headgear as well as holding cards to reflect the nation they are supporting. Another visual feature to be included are the fully modeled managers for each team like those seen in the <a href="/uefa-euro-2008/3030-20798/" data-ref-id="3030-20798">Euro 2008</a> game.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1379/1264590-6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1264590" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1379/1264590-6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1264590"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1379/1264590-6.jpg"></a><figcaption>Fans in the stadium show real emotion as they cheer on their country.</figcaption></figure><p style="">In terms of gameplay 2010 FIFA World Cup has a slightly improved version of the engine used in FIFA 10. Players will react more naturally when trapping the ball and sprinting as well as other minuscule tweaks and alterations. EA has also worked on improving the realism of the game. As the clock runs down to the final minutes, your opponents will battle harder for the victory, opponent substitutions will be made when necessary, players will slowly lose stamina and gain fatigue, and much more. Eventually, you'll have to switch out players and plan accordingly in order to secure the victory and walk away with the title.</p><p style="">The game also has new features not seen in previous instalments as well as some memorable old ones. "Captain your Country" returns from <a href="/uefa-euro-2008/3030-20798/" data-ref-id="3030-20798">Euro 2008</a> allowing you this time to import your Virtual Pro from <a href="/fifa-10/3030-26702/" data-ref-id="3030-26702">FIFA 10</a>. Putting you in the position of the captain of your team and leading them to the World Cup finals. Scenario mode from <a href="/fifa-world-cup-germany-2006/3030-1787/" data-ref-id="3030-1787">2006 FIFA World Cup</a> will also return, allowing you to play and recreate memorable moments from previous World Cups. This year, it will include over 55 different scenarios to play out from previous World Cup finals.</p><h2>Improvements over FIFA 10</h2><p style="">EA Sports has announced that the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa video game has a vast array of improvements over the previous instalment in the long running <a href="/fifa/3025-609/" data-ref-id="3025-609">FIFA</a> series. Ball control and one touch passes are improved slightly to give the player a more realistic touch and feel on the ball. Player fatigue also increases for teams playing on away turf while the home team have less of a chance of fatigue. Players can now also be injured outside of the qualifications and in their club teams. You'll be greeted with a notification letting you know how long a certain player is out for.</p><p style="">Penalty kicks have also been improved greatly over the previous iterations of the <a href="/fifa/3025-609/" data-ref-id="3025-609">FIFA</a> series and the FIFA World Cup series. Penalty kicks now have a more realistic vibe to them, allowing your kick taker to fake out the goal keeper in order to find out which direction they're planning on going, and creating a higher chance of scoring. Your keeper will now be able to respond at the very last second, much like they would in the real tournament. Keeping your eye on the ball and predicting where the ball will land gives you a greater chance of saving the shot, unless you're faked out. The keeper can jump in 6 different directions to save the ball. He can go to the lower left corner and the upper left, as well as the middle, top middle, lower right corner, and upper right corner. New shooting animations have also been added to improve realism and tweak issues that occurred during certain attacking situations.</p><p style="">User controlled celebrations are also improved, adding new and old celebrations and making it far less complex than previous versions. There is also an in game manual detailing each and every celebration available to the player, should you ever forget a few of them. Graphics have also been improved slightly, and player modules look much more realistic and up to date from <a href="/fifa-10/3030-26702/" data-ref-id="3030-26702">FIFA 10</a>. For newer players not familiar to FIFA's intricate control scheme, there is also an option to use only two buttons, allowing newer players a chance to get used to the game and encourage them to win the World Cup virtually.</p><h2>iPhone Version</h2><p style="">An iPhone version of the game was released. It has some of the same modes found in the console version such as quick match (kick off), World Cup (You basically lead your team through the Cup) Penalty shootout, multiplayer and be a pro mode. The game is played by pressing the buttons on screen. The game has a directional pad that you can move around to fit your needs and two buttons on the right side that are either pass and shoot if on offense or tackle and slide if on defense. The game also lets you take free kicks and penalties by dragging the ball in the general area that you want to shoot. the quicker you drag the ball, the harder the shot is.</p><p style="">The game was on sale in the app store for a dollar to mark the England - United States match.</p><h2>Game Modes</h2><ul><li><b><i><u>World Cup Mode</u></i></b> - Take your country through the qualification stages, all the way to the group stages at the World Cup Finals.

third-person shooter from Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Announced via a trailer on Spike TV's GameTrailers TV, Vanquish was developed by <a href="/platinumgames/3010-6319/" data-ref-id="3010-6319">PlatinumGames</a>. <a href="/shinji-mikami/3040-32999/" data-ref-id="3040-32999">Shinji Mikami</a>, creator of <a href="/resident-evil/3025-397/" data-ref-id="3025-397">Resident Evil</a> and <a href="/god-hand/3030-5888/" data-ref-id="3030-5888">God Hand</a>, directed the game, while <a href="/atsushi-inaba/3040-40595/" data-ref-id="3040-40595">Atsushi Inaba</a> worked on production. The game was released on October 19 in North America, October 21 in Japan and October 22 in Europe for <a href="/xbox-360/3045-20/" data-ref-id="3045-20">Xbox 360</a> and <a href="/playstation-3/3045-35/" data-ref-id="3045-35">PlayStation 3</a>. A demo was released on Xbox Live and Playstation Network early in September.</p><p style="">The game was unveiled at Tokyo Game Show. It does not feature any co-operative or competitive multiplayer modes.</p><p style="">The game was innovative in several ways, much like <a href="/resident-evil-4/3030-1578/" data-ref-id="3030-1578">Resident Evil 4</a> before it. It improved upon the <a title="Cover system" href="/cover-system/3015-55/" data-ref-id="3015-55">cover system</a>, where in contrast to previous cover-based shooters, the cover in Vanquish is easily <a title="Destructible environment" href="/destructible-cover/3015-112/" data-ref-id="3015-112">destructible</a>. The game also penalizes the player's ranking for the number of times they have taken cover, though its most important innovation is the <a href="/knee-sliding/3015-5921/" data-ref-id="3015-5921">power-slide </a>mechanic that allows the player to slide into and out of cover at high speeds, or in <a title="Bullet time" href="/bullet-time/3015-78/" data-ref-id="3015-78">bullet time</a>.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">The gameplay in Vanquish resembles closely that of Gears of War 2 from a mechanical standpoint. Where it differs is that it runs at a much faster pace, everything players can do in Gears they can do in Vanquish, but at about 100 times the speed. The <a href="/augmented-reaction-suit/3055-3952/" data-ref-id="3055-3952">Augmented Reaction Suit</a> (ARS) offers three main abilities to aid players in taking down enemies, these are as follows:</p><ul><li><b>Power Slide:</b> Use the ARS energy to <a href="/knee-sliding/3015-5921/" data-ref-id="3015-5921">slide</a> at rocket speeds while shooting enemies, using melee during this move will execute a deadly melee attack that kills most enemies in one hit and significantly damages those it doesn’t.</li><li><b>Melee Attacks</b>: Depending on what weapon have equipped, Sam will do different melee attacks. If players successfully land a melee attack of any kind, it will completely drain their ARS energy and overheat the suit.</li><li><b>AR Mode</b>: Augmented Reality is Vanquish’s way of saying slow motion. When using slow, the suit's energy will drain, if drained completely while using AR mode, the suit will overheat.</li></ul><h3>Weapons</h3><p style="">Sam carries the Battlefield Logic ADaptable Electronic (BLADE) Weapons System that is capable of duplicating any weapon found on the battlefield. Players can hold three weapons at any time in Vanquish along with the two grenade types, explosive and EMP. Grenades instantly detonate when thrown while power sliding. Every weapon can be upgraded, by collecting an upgrade chip that will instantly upgrade whatever weapon is currently equipped. The other way to upgrade weapons is to collect weapons players have when they have full ammo for them, this method is the only way to upgrade grenades. Below is a list of the weapons found in the game.</p><ul><li>Assault Rifle: A great all round weapon, the accuracy over long distances makes an ideal weapon for all situations and the high magazine capacity makes it very useful for boss enemies that require a body part to be damaged first as it allows ammo in more powerful weapons to be saved.</li><li>Heavy Machine Gun: Has a slower rate of fire than the standard assault rifle but is far stronger bullet-for-bullet. It loses a significant amount of accuracy over long range, it is extremely effective against bosses when used in AR mode as the player can deal huge damage very quickly.</li><li>Shotgun: Absolutely devastating at close range and stuns Romanovs, allowing the player to easily move around the back and attack the weak point. A great trick when using a machine gun in AR mode is to swap quickly to the shotgun to deal massive damage then quickly swap back to the machine gun to cancel the pump of the shotgun.</li><li>LFE gun: A single shot weapon the deals massive damage if used correctly, the centre of the energy ball needs to connect with an enemy in order for it to be most effective. The LFE gun can also knock Romanovs off their feet and send them backwards to create distance between them and the player.</li><li>Lock on Laser: This weapon has a delay in order to lock on to a target, once locked it will fire 4 shots at once which can target four separate enemies or be used to deal more damage to a single target which makes it a great choice for enemies with a lot of health.</li><li>Sniper Rifle: This only really serves its intended purpose, it must be reloaded every after shot but each bullet is very powerful. A headshot can take out grunt enemies instantly and it is especially useful for taking down turret using enemies.</li><li>Rocket Launcher: A single shot weapon that can lock on to a target and the rocket will track it. The lock on and reload speed will be significantly improved once the weapon is upgraded. It can be used to deal huge damage to bosses although it is very useful against groups of dangerous enemies.</li><li>Disk Launcher: This weapon is extremely effective against Romanovs as it can dismember their head and arms with a single shot. Its melee attack is also devastating and can expose the unknown boss’s weak point instantly.</li><li>Grenade: Are very effective against groups of enemies, they can also be triggered manually if the player shoots them. Triggering AR mode then shooting the grenade can make better use of its blast radius.</li><li>EMP: Will disable enemies momentarily, allowing the player to deal massive damage to a single foe. EMPs will instantly kill the flying enemies if thrown while they are airborne, they are also extremely useful against the bogey's.</li></ul><h3>Tri Weapon Pack</h3><p style="">For pre-ordering the game players gained access to an exclusive pack of three weapons which were later made available for download for 160 Microsoft Points. The three weapons are:</p><ul><li>Boost Machine Gun: A perfect blend of the heavy machine guns firepower and the assault rifles accuracy, this is compensated by a much smaller clip. It only has 15 shots until forcing players to reload.</li><li>Anti - Armour Pistol: This pistol has the power of the shotgun and the accuracy of the sniper rifle. One shot will cripple most grunt enemies if not kill them and the rounds will stun larger enemies such as the Romanovs.</li><li>Laser Cannon: An extremely powerful energy based weapon, requires a small delay until the beam is fired. This weapon is fueld by the ARS energy, so using it too much at once will overheat the suit, but it essentially has infinite ammo as long the ARS has energy.</li><li>All of these weapons are upgradable in the same manner as the standard weapons, the Laser Cannon's charge and suit drain replace the standard ammo upgrades that other weapons have.</li></ul><h2>Story</h2><p style="">Vanquish is set on far-future Earth where its populations has reached critical levels, creating a shortage of resources and real estate. To solve this problem, United States of America has launched SC-01 Providence, a self-sustaining space station that harnesses solar energy and is capable of supporting millions of people inside a fully functional eco-system. Meanwhile, <a href="/victor-zaitsev/3005-15960/" data-ref-id="3005-15960">Victor Zaitsev</a> of the Order of the Russian Star leads a coup in Russia. His first act as their new leader is to promptly declare war on USA by capturing Providence and turning its solar generators into a giant death ray. He destroys San Francisco with the warning shot, threatening to destroy New York next unless the USA surrenders unconditionally.</p><p style="">America responds by sending <a href="/sam-gideon/3005-15661/" data-ref-id="3005-15661">Sam Gideon</a>, a DARPA agent and the game's protagonist with a battalion of US marines, led by <a href="/robert-burns/3005-15663/" data-ref-id="3005-15663">Robert Burns</a>, to take back the station and stop Victor. Sam is also entrusted with a secret mission to rescue the scientist responsible for the space-station, <a href="/francois-candide/3005-15962/" data-ref-id="3005-15962">Dr. Francois Candide</a> and help him disable the death ray before it could be used again. The storyline is treated with a playful tone, often satirizing the events of other popular sci-fi shooters and delving into cliches from an ironic point of view.</p><h2>Development</h2><p style="">Vanquish was the result of the poorly received game called <a href="/god-hand/3030-5888/" data-ref-id="3030-5888">God Hand</a> that was created by the now defunct <a href="/clover-studio/3010-3345/" data-ref-id="3010-3345">Clover Studio</a>. Although it was considered to be a cult classic by many, God Hand did not sell well and Mikami believed that it was because he had too much creative freedom. As a result, he decided to make a game that will appeal to a wider audience by making a mainstream action game. This attempt at broader appeal is partially evident in the fact that <a href="http://platinumgames.com/2010/10/25/narrative-design-in-vanquish/" rel="nofollow">English is the lead language on Vanquish</a>, even though the developers fully acknowledge the fact that many of their fans have "a preset bias towards the Japanese language track for whatever reason."</p><p style="">The game is confirmed by Mikami to be a <a href="http://s1.zetaboards.com/The_Board_2/topic/3694998/1/" rel="nofollow">spiritual successor</a> to <a href="/pn03/3030-16637/" data-ref-id="3030-16637">P.N.03</a>, a stylish sci-fi action game that received lukewarm reviews. Mikami said the reason P.N.03 was considered inferior was because of time constraints from Capcom and he couldn't design the gunplay the way he originally intended to. He added by saying that one of the reasons he loves partnering with <a href="/sega/3010-62/" data-ref-id="3010-62">Sega</a> (publisher of Vanquish) is due to to the freedom the Sega gives him. The result of Platinum's departure from Capcom and relationship with Sega can be seen in Vanquish. The graphics of Vanquish were partially inspired by the Casshern animated television series.</p><p style="">Game development started in 2007, and the game was released on October 19th, 2010.</p><h3>Demo</h3><p style="">A playable demo was released for Vanquish on August 31st in North America and September 2nd in Japan and Europe for both the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3. The demo puts the player in the shoes of Sam Gideon and his suit as the American troops battle Russian forces in Act 1, Scene 3 of the full game, and ends with a boss battle against a large, transforming, prototype mech called the Argus.</p><h2>Reception</h2><p style="">Vanquish was widely acclaimed by critics, with many reviewers praising the game's visuals, gameplay, innovation, fast pace, and over-the-top style, though some also criticized its short length, lack of multiplayer, mediocre plot, and corny dialogue.</p><p style="">Vanquish has received <a title="Game of the Year" href="http://gaming.wikia.com/wiki/Game_of_the_Year" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">Game of the Year</a> awards from the Classic Game Room, Zavvi, and <i>TGN Times</i>. <i>X360</i> gave it the "Best Shooter" award, and GamesRadar gave it an award for Most "Oh Shit" Moments Per Minute. IGN gave it the "Best Sci-Fi Game" award. GameSpot gave the game the awards for "Best Game No One Played" and "Best Original Game Mechanic" for its <a href="/knee-sliding/3015-5921/" data-ref-id="3015-5921">rocket-sliding</a> game mechanic, which acts as both a defensive escape and an offensive setup, opening up new gameplay possibilities for action games.</p><p style="">The game has set a new trend, with its influence seen in recent shooter games that have incorporated similar sliding-boost mechanics. Some of the games that appear to have incorporated similar mechanics include <a href="/first-person-perspective/3015-330/" data-ref-id="3015-330">first-person</a> shooters such as <a title="Bulletstorm" href="/bulletstorm/3030-30088/" data-ref-id="3030-30088">Bulletstorm</a>, <a title="Crysis 2" href="/crysis-2/3030-26754/" data-ref-id="3030-26754">Crysis 2</a>, <a title="Killzone 3" href="/killzone-3/3030-30431/" data-ref-id="3030-30431">Killzone 3</a>, and <a href="/titanfall/3030-42860/" data-ref-id="3030-42860">Titanfall</a>, and third-person shooters such as <a href="/gunslinger-stratos/3025-2891/" data-ref-id="3025-2891">Gunslinger Stratos</a> and Sega's own <a title="Binary Domain" href="/binary-domain/3030-33304/" data-ref-id="3030-33304">Binary Domain</a>.</p><p style=""> </p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>29903</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/1886639-box_vanquish.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/1886639-box_vanquish.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/1886639-box_vanquish.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/1886639-box_vanquish.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/1886639-box_vanquish.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1886639-box_vanquish.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/1886639-box_vanquish.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Vanquish]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>25</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-32/]]></api_detail_url><id>32</id><name><![CDATA[CERO: D]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-16/]]></api_detail_url><id>16</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: M]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-37/]]></api_detail_url><id>37</id><name><![CDATA[PEGI: 18+]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-12/]]></api_detail_url><id>12</id><name><![CDATA[OFLC: MA15+]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2010-10-19 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-86/]]></api_detail_url><id>86</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360 Games Store]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360-games-store/3045-86/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[XBGS]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-88/]]></api_detail_url><id>88</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation Network (PS3)]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-network-ps3/3045-88/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3N]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/vanquish/3030-29903/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-29907/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2010-01-30 05:55:08</date_added><date_last_updated>2014-04-06 13:54:42</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[SingStar Latino is a Playstation exclusive featuring over 20 Latin artists.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<b>Artists Featured:</b> <br /><ul class="plain-list"><li>  Ana Torroja<br /></li><li>  Antonia Flores<br /></li><li>  Azcúcar Moreno<br /></li><li>  Camela<br /></li><li>  Carlos Baute<br /></li><li>  Chambao<br /></li><li>  Chenoa<br /></li><li>  Conchita<br /></li><li>  Coti<br /></li><li>  David Bisbal<br /></li><li>  David Bisbal<br /></li><li>  El Arrebato<br /></li><li>  Guaraná<br /></li><li>  Héroes Del Silencio<br /></li><li>  Héroes Del Silencio<br /></li><li>  Jon Secada<br /></li><li>  Juan Luis Guerra -

It was released in Japan in 2010, and in America in September  2011.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">A direct sequel to <a href="/white-knight-chronicles-international-edition/3030-21458/" data-ref-id="3030-21458">White Knight Chronicles</a>, it was released in Japan on July 8th 2010. It was released in Europe on June 10th 2011, and September 13th 2011 in North America.</p><p style="">Like the first game, WKCII allows the player to create a custom avatar which will inhabit the world alongside the named characters. If a save file from the first game is present, it also allows players to import their character from the prequel, including all of their money, equipment, and guild rankings. Again, as in the original, this character will be used most prominently in the game's online play, dubbed Georama, and will serve little purpose in the single player campaign.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/846124-ss_preview_1212siro001.jpg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-846124" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5296875" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:53.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/846124-ss_preview_1212siro001.jpg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-846124"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19745/846124-ss_preview_1212siro001.jpg.jpg"></a><figcaption>The first WKC, included on the disc</figcaption></figure><p style="">Included on the disc is a new-and-improved edition of the first <a href="/white-knight-chronicles-international-edition/3030-21458/" data-ref-id="3030-21458">White Knight Chronicles</a>, which has been "re-developed" alongside its sequel. One reason for the inclusion of the first game was that players would have to have beaten the first game in order to play the sequel, but this requirement was removed in the North American version. When players start up the game for the first time, and they have a 'clear data' save file from the first game, they will be given a choice: to start from the beginning of the first game with all their items but resetting to a Level 1 character, or starting from the ending of the first game and having their character reset to below Level 35.</p><h2>Campaign</h2><p style="">The story of WKCII picks up directly after the events of the first game, in which Princess Cisna was kidnapped by malevolent forces intent on (what else?) world domination and had to be rescued by Leonard, a humble barkeep with dormant mystical powers. Leonard and Cisna return in the sequel, along with many other cast members from the first game and a few new faces. The full cast of characters is as follows:</p><h3>Characters:</h3><ul><li><a href="/leonard/3005-13910/" data-ref-id="3005-13910">Leonard</a>: Hero of the first game, and wielder of Wizel, the titular White Knight</li><li>Cisna: Damsel in distress and primary love interest of Leonard</li><li>Yulie: Leonard's childhood friend and secondary love interest of Leonard</li><li>Eldore: Elderly mentor figure for the party</li><li>Caesar: Capable of wielding the same mystical powers as Leonard, Caesar can transform himself into the powerful Dragon Knight</li><li>Miu: A princess who accompanies the party</li><li>Scardigne: Miu's bodyguard, who joins the party to protect her</li><li>Player Avatar: Not so much a character as a constant, silent presence, the player's avatar accompanies Leonard throughout the journey but never utters a word nor influences the action directly, other than in battle</li><li>Grazel: The public face of a sinister organization composed of Magi</li><li>Shapur: Assassin for the Magi, can transform into the Black Knight</li><li>Clyde Ledom: The true leader of the Magi</li><li>Madoras: A sinister emperor with murky motivations who assists the Magi</li></ul><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1867319-wkcii10.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1867319" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1867319-wkcii10.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1867319"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1867319-wkcii10.jpg"></a><figcaption>Players can transform into the towering White Knight when a meter fills</figcaption></figure><p style="">Astute readers will note that most of the characters above were present in the first game as well, and indeed one of the biggest complaints leveled against WKCII's campaign is its similarity to that first game. The progression of dungeons in WKCII is merely the progression of dungeons in the original White Knight Chronicles, but in reverse. Again, similarly to the first game, the story never advances much beyond a simple "rescue the damsels in distress and save the world from the Magi" premise.</p><p style="">While the plot may seem very similar, numerous improvements were made to the gameplay since the first game was released. Combat still plays out similarly to an MMO, with cooldown meters governing attacks and combos, but those cooldowns have been significantly shortened, so that attacks can be made in a faster, more fluid manner. Additionally, character weight plays a larger role here than it has before. Characters carrying heavier weapons, such as axes, may take longer for their attacks to cooldown, and may dodge slower than characters with lighter weapons.</p><h2>Georama</h2><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/65194/1802060-multiplayer_vs_polkan.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1802060" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.56276595744681" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/65194/1802060-multiplayer_vs_polkan.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1802060"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/65194/1802060-multiplayer_vs_polkan.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/65194/1802060-multiplayer_vs_polkan.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Multiple players band together in Georama</figcaption></figure><p style="">Georama is the name that White Knight Chronicles uses to refer to its online mode. Those MMO parallels prominent in the combat really come into their own in Georama, which allows multiple players to band together in instanced worlds, and set out on quests to slay monsters and find treasure. Players will also build their own cities as they progress and get more money, similar to how the mechanic worked in the earlier Level 5 release, Dark Cloud. While players could only group together in packs of 4 or less in the first game, this sequel allows for up to 6 players to join in on a quest. The player-created avatar comes into its own in this mode, as none of the main characters from the campaign are playable in Georama.</p><h2>Shutting Down the Servers</h2><p style="">On March 21st, 2013, <a href="/d3-publisher-inc/3010-895/" data-ref-id="3010-895">D3 Publisher Inc.</a> announced that the servers to both White Knight Chronicles II and <a href="/white-knight-chronicles/3025-1622/" data-ref-id="3025-1622">White Knight Chronicles</a> would be taken down in both North America and Europe on June 18th, 2013. No specific reasons were cited.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>29910</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/1881099-box_wkc2.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/1881099-box_wkc2.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/1881099-box_wkc2.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/1881099-box_wkc2.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/1881099-box_wkc2.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1881099-box_wkc2.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/1881099-box_wkc2.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[White Knight Chronicles II]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-33/]]></api_detail_url><id>33</id><name><![CDATA[CERO: B]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-1/]]></api_detail_url><id>1</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: T]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-2/]]></api_detail_url><id>2</id><name><![CDATA[PEGI: 16+]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2011-09-13 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/white-knight-chronicles-ii/3030-29910/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[Days of Thunder Arcade]]></aliases><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-29929/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2010-02-01 13:58:54</date_added><date_last_updated>2012-04-29 13:24:26</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[A game based on the Tom Cruise movie of the same name.

Mass Effect 3 combines the large number of weapons, upgradable weapon statistics, and <a href="/weapon-modification/3015-2624/" data-ref-id="3015-2624">weapon modifications</a> from the original Mass Effect with the "thermal cooling" <a href="/ammo/3055-533/" data-ref-id="3055-533">ammunition</a> system of Mass Effect 2. Weapons are split up into the following categories: <a href="/assault-rifle/3055-413/" data-ref-id="3055-413">Assault Rifles</a>, <a href="/sniper-rifle/3055-67/" data-ref-id="3055-67">Sniper Rifles</a>, <a href="/pistol/3055-59/" data-ref-id="3055-59">Heavy Pistols</a>, <a href="/shotgun/3055-114/" data-ref-id="3055-114">Shotguns</a>, and <a href="/submachine-gun/3055-766/" data-ref-id="3055-766">Submachine Guns</a>.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">In the predecessor games, the player's class determines what guns they are able to use.

However, weapons now have a Weight attribute. Players carrying a heavy payload of weapons have a penalty to the recharge time of the player's active powers (up to double the standard recharge time). Conversely, players carrying a light weapon load have a recharge time bonus to their active powers (up to half the standard recharge time).</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">In single-player, weapons (other than the starting weapons) and weapon modifications must be bought or collected throughout the game.

After reaching level 20 with a single class, players can promote that class, resetting the level back down to 1 while granting bonuses for the Galaxy At War system and the N7 ranking. (Unlocked races and armor customization options are still kept)</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">In multiplayer mode, equipment are single-use items found inside most Reinforcement Packs that are split into three categories:</p><ul><li><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0"><b>Bonuses</b> - Special single-use armor and weapon modifications that can be assigned to the individual player prior to starting the match. Players can assign one bonus at a time in each category: Ammo (which grants one of the five ammo type powers to all of the player's weapons), Weapon (which grants a damage bonus for one weapon type), and Armor (which grants a bonus to either shield, movement speed, power damage, or power recharge speed). Each bonus comes in three levels of strength (increasing their effectiveness), with level 1 bonuses appearing in Common-oriented booster packs and level 3 bonuses appearing in Rare-oriented booster packs. Once the player downloads the Resurgence Pack DLC, he/she can find a new Weapon Bonus (which grants a damage bonus for melee attacks) and new Armor Bonuses (which grants a bonus to either power duration, shield recharge speed, weapon stability, or headshot damage).</p></li><li><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0"><b>Supplies</b> - Special in-game inventory items that can be activated in-game to quell desperate situations. Consists of the Cobra Missile Launcher (in which the player switches to a powerful one-shot missile launcher that can destroy all enemies in a large radius), Thermal Clip Pack (automatically refilling the player's thermal clips and grenade supply), Ops Survival Pack (automatically refilling the player's health and shields), and Medi-Gel (automatically reviving the player if he/she is incapacitated). Players can carry up to two (more if he/she finds a Supply Upgrade) of each supply.</p></li><li><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0"><b>Supply Upgrades</b> - Rare cards that automatically adds one to the capacity of a random supply, allowing the player to use more of that supply in one match.</p></li></ul><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">In addition, players can rarely find a "Reset Powers" card which they can use to reset the power distribution of one character slot (retaining all of the class's experience points). Players can carry a maximum of three "Reset Powers" options at one time.</p><h3>Reinforcement Packs</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Players earn currency (known as Credits) in-game (by successfully completing special objectives) which allows them to buy special Reinforcement Packs, containing special cards that unlock character slots, equipment, item slots, weapons, and weapon modifications.

The last mission to gain council aid involves the Asari homeworld of Thessia. While Shepard does not manage to help save Thessia from Reaper attacks, he finds that the Crucible needs a Catalyst in order to successfully destroy the Reapers. Just before acquiring the information, Kai Leng and Cerberus attack and steal the information from Shepard.

It's at this point that Shepard combines all united forces and coordinates an attack to retake the Citadel and combine it with the Crucible to destroy the Reapers. Due to the closure of the Citadel, the allied forces find that they must reopen it by using a beam being ejected to earth from the Citadel.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">At this point, Shepard and Hammer team make a final assault toward the beam, but the majority of the squad is wiped out when Harbinger intervenes and Shepard is hit by a blast. Staggering, Shepard manages to reach the beam, and finds that Anderson had done so as well. When they find a control panel, they are interrupted by the Illusive Man who's still bent on finding ways to control the Reapers and stop Shepard from destroying them. Eventually, the Illusive Man is defeated, but Anderson dies and Shepard loses consciousness just before being informed that the Crucible did not fire.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Shepard awakens and is greeted by an artificial intelligence who refers to himself as the Catalyst. The Catalyst informs Shepard that he is the entity controlling the Reapers, and that their purpose is to preserve organic life by exterminating the most advanced forms of life at the end of every cycle. He explains that it is necessary as organic life is always opposed by the synthetic life that they create and are doomed to be destroyed by their own creations.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The Catalyst also explains that life is not wasted, but merely harvested and used to create more reapers and less capable, primitive organic lifeforms are spared for the start of the new cycle. The Catalyst then admits that since Shepard proved that the cycle could not continue as it has by building the Crucible, a new plan has to be made. He offers Shepard one of three choices: Destroy the Reapers as well as all Synthetic life, Control the Reapers, or create a Synergy between organics and synthetics. The synergy would create a new form of life, new DNA, that is based on Shepard's current form - being both synthetic and organic. Each choice is color-coded with the colors: red, blue and green (respectively).</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Regardless of choice, the mass relays are all destroyed, the Reapers leave Earth, and the Normandy crash-lands on an alien planet. Depending on Effective Military Strength (EMS), Earth can be destroyed, heavily damaged, or saved and some of the Normandy crew can be seen exiting the Normandy after it crash lands. If the 'destroy' ending is chosen, and the EMS is high enough, it's revealed that Shepard survived.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">A post-credits sequence shows a man (stargazer) and a child looking up at the stars. The child asks if the story was really true, and the man confirms it but tells the child that some of the details may have been lost in time. He also states that it all happened a long time ago. The child inquires about going and seeing the stars for himself, and the man describes the galaxy as a billion stars, containing many worlds, and are all inhabited by different races and cultures. The child then asks the man to tell him another story about 'the Shepard'.</p><h2>DLC Packs</h2><h3>From Ashes</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">At Eden Prime, Shepard, Liara and another squadmate found the last Prothean. Javik is a new squadmate when buying this dlc. It is avalible through the Collector's Edition or online.</p><h3>Extended Cut</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The ending of Mass Effect 3 was harshly received by a vocal segment of the game's fanbase. Common complaints regarding the ending reference a sudden, sharp decline in the level of narrative coherence, the introduction of the Catalyst as a character in the hologram form of the little boy whose death haunts Shepard over the course of the game, and an almost complete lack of player agency. The ending also does not take into account many of the choices that players made over the course of the trilogy; rather, it forces the player to choose between one of three possible solutions to the Reaper threat (Destroy, Control, Synthesis), the availability of which are dependent on the player's Galactic Readiness rating.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Bioware addressed the criticism by announcing that they would produce a downloadable update entitled "Mass Effect 3: Extended Cut." Released on June 26, 2012, the free update adds material to all three endings in order to clarify at least some of the confusion and ambiguity. The player is also given new dialogue options during the meeting with the Catalyst to learn more about its motivations and history. The Extended Cut also offers a new, fourth ending, in which, at the player's choice, Commander Shepard can reject the Catalyst and the use of the Crucible. There is otherwise no new playable content included in the update, as the adjustments to the endings are all cinematic in nature.</p><h3>Leviathan</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Shepard was greeted by Dr. Garret Bryson to find legends and rumors about the Reapers. Shepard was told that a <a href="/leviathans/3015-7685/" data-ref-id="3015-7685">Reaper-killer</a> is on the loose. Shepard found the trackings of the Leviathan on 2181 Desponia. Shepard talked with the Leviathan and learned that the Reapers were copies of the Leviathans. The Leviathans agreed to help Shepard but only for their race. Released in August 28, 2012.</p><h3>Omega</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">At the Citadel, Aria was saying that Omega was stolen by Oleg Petrovsky. Shepard goes to Omega and met a Talon named Nyreen Kandros. Released in November 2012.</p><h4>Citadel</h4><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">At the Citadel, Shepard needed a long deserved break with old squadmates. It was interupted that a gang led by a Shepard clone wanted the real Shepard dead. Released in March 5, 2013.</p><h2>Xbox 360 Game Installation</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The installation greatly decreases loading times, and requires a total of 14.6 GB between two discs.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Disc one requires 7.6 GB, and disc two requires 7.0 GB.

It also introduces a host of new features.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">The sequel to 2008's critical darling <a href="/de-blob/3030-20646/" data-ref-id="3030-20646">de Blob</a>, de Blob 2 is a <a href="/puzzle-platformer/3015-3124/" data-ref-id="3015-3124">puzzle-platformer</a> that tasks players with painting a monochromatic metropolis in a myriad of colors to "liberate" it from the oppressive clutches of a nefarious group called de Blancs. This installment takes <a href="/de-blob/3005-6240/" data-ref-id="3005-6240">de Blob</a>, the series protagonist, back to Prisma City, and introduces a host of new features and improvements.</p><h2>Plot</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/778/1655672-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1655672" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.7" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:70.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/778/1655672-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1655672"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/778/1655672-4.jpg"></a><figcaption>The results of Comrade Black's plans. Pretty grim, eh?</figcaption></figure><p style="">de Blob 2 takes place shortly after the first game. It begins with de Blob and his new robotic life partner <a href="/pinky/3005-9624/" data-ref-id="3005-9624">Pinky</a> enjoying a pleasant trip about the skies in their blimp when suddenly the <a href="/prof/3005-7853/" data-ref-id="3005-7853">Prof</a> contacts them and asks that they investigate the nearby settlement of Paradise Island -- a popular vacation spot just outside <a href="/prisma-city/3035-3080/" data-ref-id="3035-3080">Prisma City</a> -- after getting some reports of something being horribly off around there. The two arrive to find that their old enemy, Comrade Black, is up to his old tricks again as they discover that Prisma City and its surrounding settlements have been drained of color. On top of all that, a mysterious cult known as de Blancs is going around spreading propaganda against all things colorful, and appears to be trying to rig the running election. De Blob quickly sends for his old gang, the Color Underground, to help him once again fight back against Comrade Black and liberate the masses.</p><p style="">The <a href="/nintendo-ds/3045-52/" data-ref-id="3045-52">Nintendo DS</a> version of de Blob 2 tells a completely different tale, meanwhile, taking place instead between the first game and the console versions of the second game. In this story, Comrade Black's chief scientist Dr. Von Blot uses creatures he's been experimenting on to form a new mutated Ink. De Blob happens to find the laboratory while taking a stroll through the jungle and decides to put a stop to the evil doctor's plans since he has nothing better to do.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">de Blob 2 remains similar to the first game, in terms of structure. The goal still remains to color vast, semi- <a href="/open-world/3015-207/" data-ref-id="3015-207">open world</a> levels to revive them from their current monochromatic state. Levels are typically split into three separate segments, with a new one unlocking after all the story challenges in the area have been completed and the "transformer engine" activated. Once all the story challenges within the level are complete, players may either end the level or take on additional side challenges. The constant time limit is still in place.</p><h3>Painting</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/106277/1628992-blob_surf_city.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1628992" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/106277/1628992-blob_surf_city.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1628992"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/10/106277/1628992-blob_surf_city.jpg"></a><figcaption>The city becomes much more vibrant once it's been re-painted.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The core aspect of de Blob 2's gameplay, painting, is as simple as can be. Just come into contact with anything while de Blob is dowsed in color and the item he touches will instantly be covered from top to bottom in whatever color de Blob is carrying. Different colors can be obtained from color pools or from paintbots, spider-like machines that scurry about and suck the paint out of any colored item or being.</p><p style="">Painting items comes at a cost, though, that cost being paint points, which determines how much paint de Blob is currently carrying. Each item that's painted, smashed, etc. has a certain cost. Painting buildings, for example, costs only one paint point, whereas painting a landmark would cost thirty points or more. The player is therefore encouraged to constantly replenish their paint reserve.</p><p style="">Additionally, each color has its own musical instrument associated with it, each one adding onto the underlying theme for the level. Red, for example, plays a saxophone whenever something is painted, while blue plays a guitar, and brown scratches a turntable.</p><h3>Prismans and Graydians</h3><p style="">Upon painting an entire block of buildings, the curious citizens inside start pouring out into the streets. Depending on the situation, the types of citizens that appear will either be Graydians, citizens trapped in a sort of white casing who are drained of color; who can be freed by painting them, or Prismans, who retain their color and needn't be rescued. Painting whole groups of Graydians grants extra time.</p><h3>Challenges</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/976/1402106-997372_20100607_790screen002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1402106" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.7" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:70.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/976/1402106-997372_20100607_790screen002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1402106"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/976/1402106-997372_20100607_790screen002.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/976/1402106-997372_20100607_790screen002.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>That red icon with the question mark in it is a challenge marker.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Amongst all the mindless painting, de Blob is frequently tasked with completing various challenges to progress onward. These missions task players with certain objectives such as clearing an area of enemies, painting all the buildings or billboards in the area, painting landmarks, among others. Challenges are activated by rolling up to the red mission marker, at which point Blob's partner Pinky or one of the many bystanders or members of the Color Underground, gives Blob a quick debriefing on what he needs to do. Completion awards de Blob with an extra minute added to the timer.</p><h3>2D Levels</h3><p style="">New to this installment are levels that are played on a two-dimensional plane. Whenever de Blob heads down a manhole or enters a landmark building, the game changes to a side-scrolling perspective to gain a better view of the indoor environments. Gameplay remains the same, just with a more constricted level of movement. For obvious reasons, the DS game is built entirely around this concept.</p><h3>Combat</h3><p style="">Throughout de Blob's mission to overthrow the peaceful if boring government, his adversaries (the Inkies) put up quite a fight to impede de Blob's path. All de Blob needs to do to defeat them is smash them, or run 'em over with a quick charge. Just like everything else, different types of enemies have different paint point costs. A standard Inky, for instance, only costs five points to crush, whereas one in, say, a turret costs fifty.</p><h3>Power-ups</h3><p style="">Providing some assistance are power-ups that de Blob varying abilities. The abilities are as follows:</p><ul><li><b>Supercharge</b> - Allows de Blob to preform the charge move without using up paint points.</li><li><b>Rainbow</b> - Grants de Blob the ability to use any color without needing to physically switch.</li><li><b>Haz-mat</b> - Envelops de Blob in a bubble that protects him from hazards like ink and water, fire floor pads, among others.</li><li><b>Wreaking Ball</b> - Transforms de Blob into a metal ball that can plow through enemies and allows him to sink into water. It also enables him to roll on magnetized surfaces.</li><li><b>Gravitron</b> - Sucks up any and all enemies and paint bots in the vicinity toward de Blob and crushes them under the weight of increased gravity.</li><li><b>Regen</b> - Instantly gives de Blob the maximum amount of paint points he can carry and constantly replenishes his stock over time.</li></ul><h3>Upgrades</h3><p style="">New to de Blob 2 is the ability to strengthen de Blob's attributes. This is done by collecting light bulbs spread throughout levels. Once collected, they can be exchanged to increase attributes such as the maximum amount of paint the Blob can carry or the amount of lives he starts off with at the start of a level.</p><h2>Multiplayer</h2><h3>Co-op</h3><p style="">When playing solo, another player may join in as Blob's partner Pinky in an <a href="/asymmetrical-co-op/3015-5713/" data-ref-id="3015-5713">asymmetrical co-op</a> mode. The second player is given control over a small reticule that can be used to gather small collectibles, attack enemies, and fire spare paint points onto Blob to keep him stocked.</p><h3>Competitive</h3><p style="">In de "Blob Party" mode, two players can compete to complete a series of objectives in a race to gain de most points. Points are earned by completing objectives quickly, overall number of buildings painted, and so on. Some co-operation is necessary to proceed at certain points, such as having one player stand an a pressure pad so that another can use the jump piston to get higher, but the competitive side unfortunately remains the focus.</p><p style="">Levels in this mode are all based off those from the single-player campaign.</p><h2>Xbox 360 Installation</h2><p style="">Installing the game on the <a href="/xbox-360/3045-20/" data-ref-id="3045-20">Xbox 360</a> requires 6.0GB of hard drive space. Loads are, on average, five seconds faster after installation is complete.</p><h2>3D Compatibility</h2><p style="">Both the <a href="/playstation-3/3045-35/" data-ref-id="3045-35">Playstation 3</a> and Xbox 360 versions are compatible with 3D television sets. The option for 3D must be enabled every time the game starts, and is presented in <a href="/stereoscopic-3d/3015-1204/" data-ref-id="3015-1204">stereoscopic</a> format. Due to obvious technical limitations, it is not available in the <a href="/wii/3045-36/" data-ref-id="3045-36">Nintendo Wii</a> or DS versions of the game.</p><h2>Trivia</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2222697-deblob2colortrio.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2222697" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.43808411214953" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:43.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2222697-deblob2colortrio.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2222697"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2222697-deblob2colortrio.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2222697-deblob2colortrio.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Blue, Red, Green.</figcaption></figure><p style="">de Blob 2 comes with different colored Blob on the box art depending on which console players buy the game on.

Games allegedly began working on the sequel just a couple of months after releasing the original <a href="/darksiders/3030-20991/" data-ref-id="3030-20991">Darksiders</a>. At the <a href="/igda/3015-4949/" data-ref-id="3015-4949">IGDA</a> Leadership Forum, <a href="/danny-bilson/3040-14620/" data-ref-id="3040-14620">Danny Bilson</a> mentioned further details regarding the future Darksiders title during his keynote speech. It was revealed that in Darksiders II, a new character will take center stage as the main protagonist, not <a href="/war/3005-997/" data-ref-id="3005-997">War</a>. While the sequel's protagonist is not War, the Apocalypse only happens once so the story will be set concurrently with the first game. For the July 2011 issue of Game Informer magazine, it was revealed the new protagonist is <a href="../../death/94-11419/" rel="nofollow">Death</a>.</p><p style="">Darksiders was released in the US on August 14, 2012 for <a href="../../pc/60-94/" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="../../playstation-3/60-35/" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 3</a> and <a href="../../xbox-360/60-20/" rel="nofollow">Xbox 360</a>; the game was released a week later, August 21st, in Europe. The game was also a launch title for the <a href="/wii-u/3045-139/" data-ref-id="3045-139">Wii U </a>on November 18, 2012 in the US and November 30 in Europe. A version for the PS4 was <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/articles/darksiders-2-definitive-edition-confirmed-for-ps4/1100-6425332/" data-ref-id="1100-6425332">confirmed </a>on February 16, 2015.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">The new combat system is much faster, and more reliant on offensive agile maneuvers than War's more tank-like reactive combat; while War, as the incarnation of violence, was able to withstand mighty blows, Death is frailer than his brother, unable to block, and must rely on dodging to avoid damage. Despite the concept being intrinsically tied to War, Wrath is once again the 'magic' of the game, offering up special attacks and abilities to add variety to combat as well as <a href="/secondary-weapons/3015-3303/" data-ref-id="3015-3303">secondary weapons</a> for changing up combos and reacting to specific enemy types.</p><p style="">The new <a href="/loot-gathering/3015-161/" data-ref-id="3015-161">loot system</a> puts a bigger emphasis on allowing the player to create a version of Death that plays the way they want to, with, for example, items that give more wrath allowing you to be more like a spell caster and weapons designed for <a href="/melee/3015-444/" data-ref-id="3015-444">melee</a> giving bonuses to regular combat.</p><h3>RPG Stats</h3><p style="">Stats are now also a big part of the game emphasizing how much more of an <a href="/rpg-elements/3015-3603/" data-ref-id="3015-3603">RPG</a> Darksiders II is in comparison to the first game. Although planned for the first game, development constraints prevented the stat system from making its way in but has returned for Darksiders II and is fully utilized to coincide with the loot system.</p><p style="">The four primary stats are Strength, Defense, Agility and Arcane; the allocation of which determines how you wish to play your version of Death.</p><h3>Weapons and Gear</h3><ul><li><b>A large Two-Handed Mace</b> with an <a href="../../splash-damage/92-347/" rel="nofollow">area-of-effect</a> <a href="/knock-back/3015-1912/" data-ref-id="3015-1912">knockback</a>.</li><li><b>Dual wielded <a href="/scythe/3055-95/" data-ref-id="3055-95">Scythes</a></b> that merge into one <b>Giant Scythe</b> at the end of each combo.</li></ul><p style="">All weapons have a level of quality and various stats with the strongest being called "Possessed" weapons which can be fed other items in order to grow more powerful. So far gear items that look strikingly similar to those of the first game are;</p><ul><li><b>Deathgrip</b> - primarily used for navigating and traversing the world like War's Abyssal Chain and also has the dual function of pulling smaller enemies/objects to you and pulling you towards larger ones.</li><li><b>The Void Walker</b> - a portal generator for getting to otherwise unreachable areas.</li></ul><p style="">Most weapons and <a href="/armor/3055-574/" data-ref-id="3055-574">armor</a> come in the form of loot items such as in an RPG and are fully <a href="/customization/3015-233/" data-ref-id="3015-233">customizable</a> but designed to all fit together regardless of combination. Different stats will be better for different specializations.</p><h3>Despair</h3><p style="">Death has his spectral mount <a href="../../despair/94-20527/" rel="nofollow">Despair</a>; much like <a href="../../ruin/94-13601/" rel="nofollow">Ruin</a> in the first Darksiders, Despair acts as Death's mode of fast transportation across the world of Darksiders II. This time around, he has been part of the game design from the beginning, and Despair is available from the start of the game; the is in contrast to Ruin, who was encountered late within the first game, as its environments were supposedly developed prior to Ruin being added to the game as an active mechanic.</p><h3>Reaper Form</h3><p style="">As War had his Chaos form, Death has his Reaper form; a much larger, more powerful super-state that grants far greater amounts of power for a short period of time. Since Death is a more flashy, egotistical character than the brutally pragmatic War, his Reaper form is featured in <a href="/cutscene/3015-22/" data-ref-id="3015-22">cutscenes</a> as well.</p><h3>Wrath Powers</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/2305399-darksiders2_2012_08_14_15_10_26_56.png" data-ref-id="1300-2305399" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/2305399-darksiders2_2012_08_14_15_10_26_56.png" data-ref-id="1300-2305399"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/81005/2305399-darksiders2_2012_08_14_15_10_26_56.png"></a></figure><p style=""><b>Harbinger Tree</b></p><ul><li>Teleport Slash</li><li>Harvest</li><li>Unstoppable</li><li>Frenzy</li></ul><p style=""><b>Necromancer Tree</b></p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/2305401-darksiders2_2012_08_19_14_10_38_56.png" data-ref-id="1300-2305401" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/2305401-darksiders2_2012_08_19_14_10_38_56.png" data-ref-id="1300-2305401"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/81005/2305401-darksiders2_2012_08_19_14_10_38_56.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/81005/2305401-darksiders2_2012_08_19_14_10_38_56.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Death using "Murder".</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Exhume</li><li>Aegis Guard</li><li>Murder</li><li>Bone Storm</li></ul><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/2305423-darksiders2_2012_08_14_17_24_57_99.png" data-ref-id="1300-2305423" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/2305423-darksiders2_2012_08_14_17_24_57_99.png" data-ref-id="1300-2305423"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/81005/2305423-darksiders2_2012_08_14_17_24_57_99.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/81005/2305423-darksiders2_2012_08_14_17_24_57_99.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>New in Darksiders 2 is dialogue wheels.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Set during the same time period as the original game, Death's ultimate goal in Darksiders II is to restore <a href="../../human/92-810/" rel="nofollow">Humanity</a>; the <a href="../../apocalypse/92-4640/" rel="nofollow">Apocalypse</a> was meant to occur once the Human race was ready to join either the side of Good or Evil in the End War, tipping the Balance and ending the war between Darksiders and Lightsiders once and for all. However, because the Apocalypse occurred millenia too soon, Humanity was completely wiped out by the demons who rampaged across the Earth. At the same time, Death seeks to keep his brother War protected during his journey to clear his name after he is framed for causing the Apocalypse.</p><p style="">There is a sub-plot of the game that regards the origins of the four horsemen and their once glorious race known as the Nephilim, as well as further explanation about who The Makers were. There was an official Comic released that focused on the other horseman and it has been hinted many times that they will all appear a lot more in Darksiders II.</p><h2>Development</h2><p style="">Death was designed very differently from War, appearing lean but not emaciated, a distinct contrast to his usual depiction as a cloaked skeleton. His armor is very similar to War's in design, though with Death preferring to forsake any torso or shoulder armor to give him the maximum amount of maneuverability - unlike War, Death cannot block, and relies entirely on dodges to avoid injury.</p><p style="">The four horsemen themselves are the last remaining members of a race known as the Nephilim, incredibly powerful super-beings with varying forms relatively similar to that of humans. The four were controlled by the neutral faction known as the Charred Council, initially represented as three giant stone faces in the first game. The Nephilim were almost wiped out after they declared war on Heaven; it was believed that the role of the species who would sway the Balance in the End War would go to the Nephilim, who were outraged when instead that destiny was given to the mortal race of <a href="/human/3015-810/" data-ref-id="3015-810">Humans</a>. The forces of Light wiped out all but four of the Nephilim in the ensuing war.</p><p style="">The primary setting for Darksiders II is a realm of forgotten battlefields and destroyed worlds left behind by countless wars between Heaven and Hell. The major local is known as the Abyssal Plains. The more fantastical setting of Darksiders II has allowed Vigil to expand their artistic style much more thoroughly across the game than in the original since <a href="/earth/3035-65/" data-ref-id="3035-65">Earth</a> isn't the primary location this time around.</p><p style="">Town <a href="/hub-world/3015-1855/" data-ref-id="3015-1855">hubs</a> with <a href="/non-player-character/3015-967/" data-ref-id="3015-967">NPCs</a> will be present offering up the standard RPG tropes of item vendors and <a href="/optional-objective/3015-3461/" data-ref-id="3015-3461">optional quest</a> givers.</p><h2>Wii U Version</h2><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2333213-darksiders_ii_wiiu_abilities.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2333213" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2333213-darksiders_ii_wiiu_abilities.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2333213"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2333213-darksiders_ii_wiiu_abilities.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2333213-darksiders_ii_wiiu_abilities.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Two screens, two dark sides.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The Nintendo Wii U version of the game makes use of the touch screen for inventory/map functions and the gyro sensor in the GamePad for evading enemy attacks. <a href="/off-tv-play/3015-7482/" data-ref-id="3015-7482">Off-TV Play</a> is also supported.

You now have greater control over the ball's direction as it comes off the bat, or more precise pitching on breaking balls, etc.</p><h3>My Player Mode</h3><p style="">The feature that started in <a data-ref-id="3030-26928" href="/nba-2k10/3030-26928/" slug="nba-2k10">NBA 2K10</a> has made it's way over to 2K's MLB series. The basic goal of this mode is similar to those found in games like Madden for a few years now. The player starts with an up and coming baseball player and has to basically role play his career and turn that player into a Hall of Famer. You increase your player's attributes through both practice drills throughout the season as well as achieving goals given to you during games . The player controls only his/her single player throughout games and the rest of the players are CPU controlled.</p><h3>MLB Today</h3><p style="">This is another extension on an <a data-ref-id="3030-26928" href="/nba-2k10/3030-26928/" slug="nba-2k10">NBA 2K10</a> feature. The idea of this is to bring game commentary to life by detecting all kinds of stats from previous real life MLB games and incorporating them into the in-game commentary. For example, an announcer may bring up how the team you are playing as have won the previous two games in a series and what it could mean record-wise if they were to sweep the series. If you are playing a quick game, the stats will be pulled from real life games. However if you are playing a custom franchise mode, it will pull stats from fictional games within your franchise mode.</p><h2>$1,000,000 Challenge and Fathead Offer</h2><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/23298/1511981-2k_background_winner.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1511981" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.88757396449704" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:88.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/23298/1511981-2k_background_winner.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1511981"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/23298/1511981-2k_background_winner.jpg"></a><figcaption>Winner of the million dollar challenge.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The MLB 2K10 creators issued a challenge to be the first to pitch a perfect game.

While players in the CHL are considered professionals, they will not be compensated for their appearance in the game. Teams also will not gain any financial benefit as they are using their appearance as more of a promotional tool to raise popular awareness of junior hockey. <br/> <br/><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/38151/1382597-nhl_11_skaters2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1382597" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/38151/1382597-nhl_11_skaters2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1382597"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/38151/1382597-nhl_11_skaters2.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/38151/1382597-nhl_11_skaters2.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Cup is Memorial!

an interview with the <a href="http://www.oxmonline.com/" rel="nofollow"> Official Xbox Magazine</a>, creative director <a data-ref-id="3040-75229" href="/david-littman/3040-75229/" slug="david-littman">               David Littman</a> confirmed that broken sticks had made their way into the game and are a product of the game's new physics engine, which will further the unpredictability of games played in NHL 11.  Over the past few years of the franchise, there has been an emphasis on matching the unpredictability of real-life hockey and the tradition continues in the 2010 iteration.  When a stick breaks, the player will be able to get a stick from a teammate, get a stick from the bench (or get off the ice entirely), or keep playing the puck with only their hands and feet (in accordance with NHL rules, of course).  In addition to broken sticks (which Littman said the team didn't want to put into the game until they could "do it right"), Littman used examples of face-offs and getting around defensemen as situations in which the new physics engine will play a major role.  Littman also mentioned that the game will rely less on canned animations as a result of the integration of the physics engine.  <br/>  <br/>The new physics engine has revolutionized the way hits are handled in the game.  No longer are hits canned animations.  No two hits will be exactly alike, as they are derived from real-life physics based on the players' heights, weights, angles, speeds, and strengths.  Hits are still tied to the right analog stick, with hip checks available when the player clicks the stick in.  The physics engine is based on the one found in<a data-ref-id="3030-20452" href="/fight-night-round-4/3030-20452/" slug="fight-night-round-4">   Fight

more engaging and dynamic than in previous years.  Faceoffs have been totally overhauled, allowing for forehanded or backhanded grips as well as various ways to win the face-off: cleaning passing to a teammate, tying up the opposing center, or winning the draw forward to start a rush.  Players are also able to shoot directly from the faceoff, allowing them to recreate <a data-ref-id="3005-14058" href="/mario-lemieux/3005-14058/" slug="mario-lemieux">              Mario Lemieux</a>'s famous goal where he did just that.  The face-off controls are organically integrated into the controls for the rest of the game.  For example, players shoot off the face-off the same way they shoot during other parts of the game and they win the draw forward by using the deke controls.  Players can also clear the puck off the face-off by using the same puck-dumping controls as in the rest of the game.  However, in the interest of maintaining the flow of the game, players will not be kicked out of the face-off circle for being too anxious to win the draw.<br/> <br/>While players still have a face-off rating and it has an impact on their performance in the face-off circle, face-offs now have a strategic component.  The strengths and weaknesses of different approaches are as follows: <br/> <br/><ul class="plain-list"><li>Tying up the opposing center is favored over backhand grips. </li><li>Winning the draw cleanly with a backhand grip is favored over stick lifts. </li><li>Stick lifts are favored over forehand grip attempts. </li><li>Forehand grip attempts are favored over tie-ups. </li><li>Winning the face-off forward is relatively weak, especially against tie-ups.</li><li>Shooting/clearing the puck off the draw is not favored over any other approach and requires precise timing.</li></ul> <br/><h3>Hockey Ultimate Team (EA Ultimate Hockey League)</h3><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image"

franchises,  NHL 11 is the first EA hockey title to feature Ultimate Team.  Essentially, it is a mode where a player earns virtual trading cards which determine the composition of his or her team.  The player then uses this team and plays against AI or online human opponents.  Playing through these games earn more currency (EA Pucks) to buy better cards (via auctions and card packs) to more effectively customize a player's team.  Players can also purchase card packs with Microsoft points, but producers have asserted that this will be wholly optional and that players can grow their team simply by playing the game.  Players are also able to trade cards with one another.  <b> Players will need to be connected to EA's servers to play Ultimate Team.  This is to protect the integrity of the league.  Xbox Live Silver members will still be able to play the offline tournaments, but an internet connection is required.</b><br/> <br/>The mode will be integrated into a league, the EA Ultimate Hockey League (EAUHL).  The EAUHL will have a "pre-season", regular season, post-season (playoffs), as well as an off-season.  <br/>  <figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image"

complete the offline tournament available in the demo, they will be rewarded with a card pack in the full game.  Players can earn an additional card pack with the demo by inviting a friend to try the game, as well.  Completing the tournament included in the demo will upgrade a player's bonus pack.  <br/> <br/>The regular season for the EAUHL lasts for a real-life month.  Players pit their teams against one another over <a data-ref-id="3015-1404" href="/xbox-live/3015-1404/" slug="xbox-live">  Xbox Live</a> or the <a data-ref-id="3015-2623" href="/playstation-network/3015-2623/" slug="playstation-network">  PlayStation Network</a> to determine their ranking for the playoffs.  Depending on players' performance in the regular season, they will be placed into one of three playoff brackets: Amateur, Pro, or Elite.  The playoffs occur during the first three days of the following month, but players are still able to play ranked games for the next season of EAUHL.  Players who do well in the EAUHL post-season are rewarded with arena banners and on-ice logos to show off their accomplishments. <br/> <br/>After a EAUHL season (including playoffs) is over, all players will be able to get two packs of cards for free to represent the league's off-season: a Free Agent Pack and a Draft Pack.  The former will include two player cards and one contract card; the latter will

have two different numbers on their cards: a contract number and a career number.  The contract number indicates how many more games they will play for your team before needing a new contract and the career number indicates how many more games they can play before the card becomes unavailable for use on your roster.  Players demand salaries appropriate to their abilities and the league will

something. </figcaption></figure>     The popular EA Sports Hockey League (EASHL) returns in NHL 11 with various changes.  Teams are able to customize their jerseys for the first time.  Also, the league's structure has been revamped to be something comparable to the EAUHL.  Every month, teams will compete online to get themselves placed in one of three divisions: Amateur, Pro, or Elite.  Each division will hold a single-elimination playoff at the end of the month.<br/> <br/>EASHL in NHL 11 also features a practice mode, in which you and your teammates can play a scrimmage versus AI and/or teammates.  Teams can also do AI-free practice to get better at various situations in a controlled environment. <br/> <br/>NHL 11's EASHL will also feature an option to only play against teams using human-controlled goaltenders.<br/> <br/><h3>Be a GM</h3> Be a GM now features Restricted Free Agents, Pre-Season (in which minor and junior league players can try out for the NHL team), seven draft rounds as opposed to NHL 10's five, and improved AI for computer-controlled teams.   AI-controlled teams will be less likely to trade top talent and there will be more movement in the minor leagues.  Good players will also be less likely to sit in the free agent pool unsigned.  GMs can trade draft picks up to six years in advance, whereas in NHL 10 GMs could only trade picks from the next NHL Entry Draft.  GMs are able to trade five assets at a time, as opposed to the three-asset limit in previous games.  Players drafted from CHL teams will abide by real-life rules, only being allowed to play a limited number of NHL games before they become ineligible to go back to their junior club.<br/> <br/> <h3>Be a Pro </h3>Players will start as an undrafted twenty-year-old CHL player trying to make one last impression in the MasterCard Memorial Cup.  Players choose a CHL team to compete with and play through the tournament with said team.  Their draft position will depend on their performance in the tournament and, for the first time, players aren't guaranteed to be selected in the first round.  The RFA/UFA rules apply to Be a Pro as well.<br/> <br/><h3>AHL License  </h3> In addition to the introduction of the CHL, EA Sports's contract with the American Hockey League, the professional hockey league that serves as a developmental league for adult players aspiring to reach the NHL, has been extended until the 2013-14 season.  EA's NHL series has featured the AHL since<a data-ref-id="3030-18227" href="/nhl-08/3030-18227/" slug="nhl-08">    NHL 08</a> .</div><div><br/><h2>Soundtrack</h2>NHL 11 features a licensed soundtrack as many officially licensed sports games do.  Both of EA's 2010-released hockey titles feature a remarkably authentic playlist, as many of the songs in the game are often played at real-life hockey games.  NHL 11 will have all of the following songs:  <ul class="plain-list"><li>2 Unlimited - <strong>Twilight Zone</strong> - Get Ready!</li><li>Airbourne - <strong>Bottom Of The Well</strong> - No Guts.  No Glory.    </li><li>Black Box - <strong>Strike It Up</strong> - Dreamland</li><li>The Black Keys

announced that former University of Florida quarterback and 2007 Heisman Trophy Winner Tim Tebow would grace the cover of NCAA Football 11.  This also broke the two-year trend of having a different player on the cover for different platforms. <br/> <br/>Two weeks later, the cover art was revealed for the game with different covers for the <a data-ref-id="3045-35" href="/playstation-3/3045-35/"

href="/ea-sports/3010-6255/" slug="ea-sports">                                 EA Sports</a> began adding <a data-ref-id="3015-1931" href="/screenshots/3015-1931/" slug="screenshots">

Facebook page every week.  Examples include the University of Oregon, Texas Tech University, Stanford University and many more. <br/> <br/>On March 25, 2010, <a data-ref-id="3010-6255" href="/ea-sports/3010-6255/" slug="ea-sports">                               EA Sports</a> designer <a data-ref-id="3040-20953" href="/russell-kiniry/3040-20953/" slug="russell-kiniry">                              Russ Kiniry</a> released an article detailing the revamped lighting system implemented in NCAA Football 11.  Using linear lighting, the development team was able to achieve natural skin tones, as well realistic <a data-ref-id="3015-3093" href="/reflection/3015-3093/" slug="reflection">                         reflections</a> on jerseys and <a data-ref-id="3055-315" href="/football-helmet/3055-315/" slug="football-helmet">                       helmets</a>. <br/> <br/>A week later, on April 5, 2010, an article was posted on <a data-ref-id="3010-6255" href="/ea-sports/3010-6255/" slug="ea-sports">                      EA Sports</a>' blog with revealing a revamped locomotion engine.  This new engine was to be momentum-based and involved any actions a player made involving running, turning, and cutting.  While previous iterations of <a data-ref-id="3025-485" href="/ncaa-football/3025-485/" slug="ncaa-football">                     NCAA Football</a> placed a heavy emphasis on a given player's speed rating, this new engine placed more weight upon a player's agility and acceleration ratings, giving players with a lower top speed more utility.  A larger motion capture facility also enabled the development team at <a data-ref-id="3010-422" href="/ea-tiburon/3010-422/" slug="ea-tiburon">                    EA Tiburon</a> to create more natural run cycles. <br/> <br/>For the first time in the <a data-ref-id="3025-485" href="/ncaa-football/3025-485/" slug="ncaa-football">                  series</a>, full ESPN integration was to be included for the in-game presentation.  Previous entries included live updates from ESPN's Sportscenter and a news ticker, but NCAA Football 11 was the first to include ESPN College Football theme music, as well as in-game graphics.  The updated in-game UI included the ESPN game clock, stat banners and <a data-ref-id="3015-45" href="/instant-replay/3015-45/" slug="instant-replay">                replay</a> wipes.  The main menu was also updated with an ESPN look and the best recruits are tagged with the ESNPU Top 150 tag. <br/> <br/>In late April, NCAA Football 11 Associate Designer Mike Scantlebury revealed the improvements made to general gameplay, dubbed <a href="http://ncaafootball.easports.com/blog.action?blogId=RealAssignmentAI" rel="nofollow">              Real Assignment AI</a>.  These improvements were largely made to the AI blocking schemes in the gameplay engine.  This allowed for the gameplay design team to create realistic blocking assignments for more complicated running schemes, with specific mentions of read option, triple option, stretch and draw plays.  It was also announced that running AI for the CPU would be greatly improved from past versions of the game.  <br/> <br/>It was later announced that there would be a number of <a href="http://ncaafootball.easports.com/blog.action?blogId=Entrances" rel="nofollow">             team-specific stadium entrances</a>, adding to the in-game presentation in a way never seen in the current generation of consoles.  Teams announced to have received this treatment include Clemson, Florida, Florida State, Miami, Nebraska, Notre Dame, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia Tech and more.  There are rumored to be 30  teams in all to have specific stadium entrances. In a video that was released later, it was also revealed that there will be fan-specific <a data-ref-id="3015-22" href="/cutscene/3015-22/" slug="cutscene">         cutscenes</a> and chants for a number of teams.  <br/> <br/><h2>Dual-Analog Stick Controls</h2>New this year is a new Dual-analog stick controls which gives you control over both lower and upper body of the ball carrier for example if you have a fast agile runner and lean away from a defender and you setup a easy spin move to get out of the tackle.<br/> <br/> <br/>Other features added to the game include: <br/><ul class="plain-list"><li>Game speed slider</li><li>More challenging Hit Stick   </li><li>Auto-Turbo option</li><li>New onside kick camera</li></ul>  <br/> <h2>EA Team Builder</h2>Like NCAA 10, NCAA 11 allows you to go <a href="http://www.easports.com/teambuilder#/home" rel="nofollow">   online </a>and create a  school to use in the game.

The game is a mish-mash of different genres; specifically the light-gun, on-rails shooter (specifically, the <i><a data-ref-id="3025-336" href="/house-of-the-dead/3025-336/">House of the Dead</a></i> series) and the music/rhythm game popularized by the <i><a data-ref-id="3025-289" href="/guitar-hero/3025-289/">Guitar Hero</a></i> and <i><a data-ref-id="3025-567" href="/rock-band/3025-567/">Rock Band</a></i> series. A <a data-ref-id="3045-36" href="/wii/3045-36/">Wii</a> version had been in development but was "put on the back-burner" shortly before the game's release to focus on the other platforms. The Wii version never materialized.</p><p style="">Instead of shooting enemies using a traditional light gun-type cursor, such as in other genre titles like <a data-ref-id="3030-25358" href="/dead-space-extraction/3030-25358/">Dead Space: Extraction</a> and <a data-ref-id="3030-11454" href="/resident-evil-the-umbrella-chronicles/3030-11454/">Resident Evil: Umbrella Chronicles</a>, <i>Rock of the Dead-</i>players eliminate foes by stringing together series of color-coded notes that appear above the enemies' heads using their guitar peripheral. Each character on-screen has a unique series, letting the player can choose which baddy to deal with first.</p><p style="">Specific guitar "riffs" are attached to specific enemies. Zombies have an average amount of notes, roaches &amp; other insects have only one or two note sequences, while larger enemies have significantly more than 3 notes in a riff. There are only a few moments in the game (mostly during boss battles) when playing notes in time with the backing track of the game, akin to a <i>Guitar Hero</i> title, becomes necessary.</p><p style="">Since <a data-ref-id="3010-648" href="/harmonix-music-systems-inc/3010-648/">Harmonix</a> owns the "floating note highway" patent that is used in <i>Guitar Hero</i> &amp; <i>Rock Band,</i> the note tracking happens horizontally in this title, the colors corresponding to those on the guitar peripherals. The game is compatible with most guitar game controllers, including those from third-party manufacturers such as MadCatz.</p><p style="">Rob Zombie was actually written into the fiction of the game, and players can collect 8 of his body parts to unlock a Rob Zombie boss character. He provided his likeness as well as a couple of his most famous songs.</p><h2>Music</h2><p style="">PS3 and 360 owners will have the standard leaderboards and Achievements/Trophy support. They will also get 8 Rob Zombie and White Zombie tracks (including "Superbeast", "Dragula" and others), while the rest of the soundtrack consists of metal/rock covers of license-free, classical pieces from Beethoven, Bach and other famous composers. Each level has a specific theme or song tied to it, throughout the entirety of said level.</p><h2>Voice Talent</h2><p style=""><a data-ref-id="3010-6495" href="/epicenter-studios/3010-6495/">Epicenter Studios</a> is aiming for a light-hearted, campy feel for <i>Rock of the Dead</i>. To that end they have announced that the lead character will be voiced by <a data-ref-id="3040-90894" href="/neil-patrick-harris/3040-90894/">Neil Patrick Harris</a>, the unnamed protagonist/slacker/stoner-type and that <a data-ref-id="3040-97740" href="/felicia-day/3040-97740/">Felicia Day</a> will portray his 'love interest'.

For instance, no likenesses of actual musicians was used due to the two lawsuits from the band No Doubt, and the late Kurt Cobain's widow, Courtney Love. Character only include player-created rockers and the stable of fictional Guitar Hero musicians from previous games<a data-ref-id="3005-763" href="/judy-nails/3005-763/" slug="judy-nails"> </a><a data-ref-id="3005-780" href="/axel-steel/3005-780/" slug="axel-steel"> </a>. Additionally, the songs chosen for the game focus more on traditional rock and roll and heavy metal, rather than the arguably unfocused setlists of some previous Guitar Hero games. There is also only one real-world venue in the game, the now-defunct CBGB in New York<em>.</em><br/><br/> <h2>New Features </h2>The basic formula of Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock did not change drastically from earlier iterations of the franchise, but included several new features: <br/> <br/> <ul class="plain-list"> <li><b>Bass Open Note Sustains:</b> <a data-ref-id="3030-20673" href="/guitar-hero-world-tour/3030-20673/" slug="guitar-hero-world-tour">         Guitar Hero: World Tour</a> introduced open bass notes - notes that only require a strum while not holding any fret buttons to play. The sustained notes in Warriors of Rock work in the same way that the open notes did, but require the player to tap the strum bar (or slider neck) until the open sustain finishes.</li> <li><b>Time Bar</b>: A new part of the HUD which tells the player how far they are into the song and when they have reached the half way point. This allows for increased strategy when deploying Star Power.</li><li><strong>Facebook/Twitter Intergration</strong>: This is a feature that  is becoming common in games today and Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock  joins the fold by letting players post their scores and in-game achievements  either via tweets (for example "*name* rocked “Bohemian Rhapsody” on  Expert Guitar in Quickplay Score: 283,638 <a href="http://twitter.com/search?q=#GHWOR" rel="nofollow">              #GHWOR</a>") or Facebook wall posts.</li></ul><br/> <h2>Quest Mode</h2>The main career mode of Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock is called "Quest Mode." This is a story-based mode, narrated by the Demigod of Rock played by KISS frontman and bassist <a data-ref-id="3040-29749" href="/gene-simmons/3040-29749/" slug="gene-simmons">          Gene Simmons</a>, where players complete songs to earn stars. The maximum amount of stars that can be earned on a single song is 5 (depending on how well you do on the song, 3 more stars can be earned - 1 for hitting 100% of the songs notes and 2 more for getting a very high score).  <br/> <br/>Earning enough stars unlocks special alter-egos of Guitar Hero's stable of fictional characters. These alter-egos have special properties that affect gameplay in some way. For example, completing challenges as <a data-ref-id="3005-794" href="/lars-umlaut/3005-794/" slug="lars-umlaut">        Lars Ümlaüt</a> unlocks a pig-like character called "Warrior Lars" whose score multiplier can go up to 6x, rather than the standard 4x. Halfway though the quest the player encounters the Demigod's Guitar, where they play through all 20 minutes and 33 seconds of Rush's "2112". The song is broken up into seven sections by narration from the band members of Rush (Rush have said that 2112 was chosen because the songs lyrics describe the situation of the Warriors/player finding the cave in which the guitar is bound in stone). This part of the quest also has 4 different venues modeled after the world that is described in 2112.<br/> <br/> <h3>The Official Setlist </h3>In Quest mode the setlist is split &amp; grouped into songs of similar genres and each group of songs relates to a specific character in the game. For example, most of the punk songs relate to <a data-ref-id="3005-796" href="/johnny-napalm/3005-796/" slug="johnny-napalm">       Johnny Napalm</a>. Each group of songs has up to 6 main songs and one "Transformation"/Encore song where the character that belongs to that group transforms into their Warrior alter-ego. There are in total 93 songs included on disc, all are master tracks. As of August 17th 2010 all of the 93 on disc tracks have been grouped as follows.   <br/>  <br/><b> <figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39063/1536804-5866_johnnynapalmwarrior_1283444703.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1536804" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.7777777777778" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:177.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39063/1536804-5866_johnnynapalmwarrior_1283444703.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1536804"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/39063/1536804-5866_johnnynapalmwarrior_1283444703.jpg"></a></figure></b><b> </b><b>Warrior Johnny (Power = Speed Freak/2x Minimum Multiply)</b> Johnny Napalm, Genre: Punk <br/>The Buzzcocks  –  “What Do I Get?” <br/>Twisted Sister – “We're Not Gonna Take It”<br/>The Runaways – “Cherry Bomb” <br/>The Offspring – “Self Esteem” <br/>Sum 41 – “Motivation”  <br/>Bad Brains – “Re-Ignition (Live)”<br/>Soundgarden – “Black Rain” <br/><i>Transformation/Encore</i>: The Ramones – “Theme From Spiderman”<br/> <br/> <br/><b><a data-ref-id="3005-16665" href="/echo-tesla/3005-16665/" slug="echo-tesla">      Echo Tesla</a>, </b>Genre: Industrial<br/> <figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39063/1536803-5866_echoteslawarrior_1283444703.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1536803" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.7777777777778" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:177.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39063/1536803-5866_echoteslawarrior_1283444703.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1536803"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/39063/1536803-5866_echoteslawarrior_1283444703.jpg"></a><figcaption>Warrior Echo (Power = Star Power Generator)</figcaption></figure>Linkin Park – “Bleed It Out” <br/>The Hives – “Tick Tick Boom”<br/>The Vines – “Get Free”<br/>Bush – “Machinehead”   <br/>Band of Skulls – “I Know What I Am”<br/>Flyleaf – “Again”  <br/>Phoenix – “Lasso”<br/>Interpol – “Slow Hands”<br/>Nine Inch Nails – “Wish”  <br/><i>Transformation/Encore</i>: Muse  –  "Uprising" <br/> <br/> Echo's setlist is a mixture of punk/garage rock &amp;

It also incorporates the challenge feature from <a data-ref-id="3030-24711" href="/guitar-hero-5/3030-24711/" slug="guitar-hero-5"> Guitar Hero 5</a>'s career mode, every song (and any song the player owns through ether imports or DLC) and song challenges not found in quest mode. Each challenge features three possible completion levels - Gold, Platinum, and Diamond - Diamond being the hardest (and most of the time requires the player to play on expert). The types of challenge differ for each song and instrument. The development team also stated that they are looking into integrating Kinect functionality into the game, though they didn't have any details about their plans.<br/>   <h2>Returning Modes </h2>The online competitive modes, like Momentum, Streakers, and Do or Die, return and work in the same way they did in               Guitar Hero 5.<br/> <br/><b> <h2>The New Guitar</h2></b> <p style="">Warriors of Rock features yet another new guitar, with new a few new features to go along with it. The most notable difference is that the guitar controller features detachable wings on the side of the body, which allow the player to customize the look of the guitar to their personal taste. While               Activision has not confirmed that they will not release new guitar designs, they did hint that it could be a long time before a redesign is released. Also, all electronics now reside within the guitar's neck, as opposed to being in the controller's body, which should free up space within the guitar itself, or allow for much more customization of the body itself.  <br/><br/></p> <h2>Pre-order Bonuses</h2> <p style=""><b> Gamestop Pre-order Bonus Guitar</b></p> <figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39063/1395611-500x_gh2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1395611" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.56551724137931" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39063/1395611-500x_gh2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1395611"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/39063/1395611-500x_gh2.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/39063/1395611-500x_gh2.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Gamestop Pre-order Bonus Guitar </figcaption></figure> <p style="">Gamestop was offering an exclusive guitar to those who pre-order Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock through them.  The guitar features a battle axe-inspired design.<br/></p> <br/> <b>US Exclusive: Soundgarden - Telephantasm Album Giveaway </b><br/>The first one million US pre-orders of the game included the Soundgarden album Telephantasm: A Retrospective free of charge included with the game.<br/><br/> <h2>Downloadable Content &amp; Imports</h2>  All past DLC (as well as imports) work with Guitar Hero: Warriors Of Rock.

more.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Story Mode</h2><p style="">The Story Mode of Toy Story 3 has the player going through a story that's loosely based on the plot of the movie, introducing new (and classic) characters and locations from the Toy Story universe. Players get to control Buzz Lightyear, Sheriff Woody, and Jessie, with each one having their own play-style. There will also be a number of collectibles for the player to find, each of which unlocks something in Toy Box Mode. The game also features Co-Op (both split screen and online).</p><p style="">The Story Mode featured in the game vaguely follows the events of the movie, and during the gameboard scenes some of the characters give away spoilers concerning the motion picture. The story mode is relatively short, completing it would only take an hour or so for the hardened gamer. During the story mode you control three characters and each have their own skills. Woody the Sheriff can use his pullstring to attach to certain background elements and pull himself to positions where others cannot reach. Buzz Lightyear is the strongest of the bunch, and he can throw objects and characters farther while Jessie the Yodeling Cowgirl can jump on to surfaces that are too small for any other toy in the player's control. There are scenes in the game where teamwork is crucial but the majority of the Story Mode is so short that the game does not manage to make good use of the somewhat solid and fun mechanics featured in the game. Characters can jump, double jump, run, climb, throw objects, ride Bullseye(Woody's Horse), drive toy cars, charge&amp;hit and do a smashing action by jumping and stomping. The Story Mode features The Buzz Lightyear Video Game featured in the second movie, and is for the most part true to its origin. The background music, sound effects, level design are very similar to the movie. Within the Buzz Lightyear game players can fly, hover, dodge meteors and use the laser mounted on Buzz' right arm. The game also features several "imagination" levels where you play in the non-existing world that either Andy Davis or Bonnie envisioned. These levels include rescuing orphans from a train set to be destroyed by Hamm and escaping Bonnie's room flooded with coffee while avoiding attacks by Dolly.</p><h2>Toy Box Mode</h2><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/63119/1357971-zurg.png" data-ref-id="1300-1357971" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="medium" data-ratio="1.2128514056225" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:121.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/63119/1357971-zurg.png" data-ref-id="1300-1357971"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/63119/1357971-zurg.png"></a><figcaption>Zurg is exclusive to the PS3</figcaption></figure><p style="">Toy Box Mode is an <a data-ref-id="3015-207" href="/open-world/3015-207/" slug="open-world">open world</a>, sandbox-style environment where players can explore and play with the toys and collectibles any way they like. There are different missions for different toys, racing, character customization, and more. This mode encourages and rewards the player for being creative.</p><p style="">Exclusive to the PlayStation 3, players will also get to control <a data-ref-id="3005-4556" href="/emperor-zurg/3005-4556/" slug="emperor-zurg">Zurg</a> in Toy Box Mode. Zurg has his own unique missions, weapons, and play-style.</p><p style="">Toy Box Mode allows the player to select one of three characters; <a data-ref-id="3005-4552" href="/buzz-lightyear/3005-4552/" slug="buzz-lightyear">Buzz</a>, <a data-ref-id="3005-4555" href="/sheriff-woody/3005-4555/" slug="sheriff-woody">Woody</a> or Jessie and allows them to create and live the imagination of Andy Davis. Toy Box is essentially a sandbox experience where you can purchase new buildings, zones, vehicles, items and accessories. With each new item comes a quest, with each now zone comes new environments, items, characters and mini-games for the player to invest his gold in. Gold can be earned by completing quests or mining using the pick-axe given to you by Stinky Pete the Prospector. Toy Box gives you the ability to customize, however replay value is nearly non existent as the player is always presented the same challenges with same rewards. Toy Box Mode features different essential Toy Story characters such as Hamm, Rex and Slinky, scattered around different zones.</p><h2>PlayStation Move</h2><p style="">Toy Story 3 supports the <a data-ref-id="3015-4669" href="/playstation-move/3015-4669/" slug="playstation-move">PlayStation Move</a> motion controller in the form downloadable mini-game add-ons. One of them will allow you to fire Zurg's cannon from a first-person perspective using the Move.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>30039</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/1825113-box_tstory3.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/1825113-box_tstory3.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/1825113-box_tstory3.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/1825113-box_tstory3.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/1825113-box_tstory3.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1825113-box_tstory3.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/1825113-box_tstory3.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Toy

Maxi Boost</em>.</p><h2>Gameplay Changes</h2><p style=""><b>Extreme Burst</b> works similarly to the Awaken systems of earlier games in the series: after the EX gauge is filled half-way or whole, the player can press ABC to activate a power-up for a limited time. Additionally, NEXT Dash (now <b>Extreme Action</b>) can no longer cancel melee. The ability to call a Mobile Assist is now character-specific. A new cost tier, 2500, has been added.</p><h2>Featured MS</h2><h3>Mobile Suit Gundam</h3><ul><li>Gundam (<a href="/amuro-ray/3005-4152/" data-ref-id="3005-4152">Amuro Ray</a>) - 2000</li><li>Char's Gelgoog (<a href="/char-aznable/3005-4072/" data-ref-id="3005-4072">Char Aznable</a>) -

Focused on a <a data-ref-id="3015-6709" href="/skillshot/3015-6709/">"kill with skill"</a> system, players are encouraged to make creative use of their vast array of weaponry (including their <a data-ref-id="3015-2790" href="/front-kick/3015-2790/">mighty kicks</a> and their unique "instinct leash") and the environmental hazards to earn big points and earn upgrades.</p><p style="">The main story follows <a data-ref-id="3005-14733" href="/grayson-hunt/3005-14733/">Grayson Hunt</a>, a crude <a data-ref-id="3015-445" href="/pirates/3015-445/">space pirate</a> and former leader of a black ops team known as Dead Echo, as he journeys through the planet of Stygia (with his cybernetic partner <a data-ref-id="3005-14734" href="/ishi-sato/3005-14734/">Ishi Sato</a>) to gain revenge on his old commander, <a data-ref-id="3005-18160" href="/victor-sarrano/3005-18160/">General Sarrano</a>. The game also includes a four-player <a data-ref-id="3015-108" href="/cooperative-play/3015-108/">cooperative multiplayer</a> mode called Anarchy Mode, in which players must endure waves of hordes (and can only progress when the team earns enough bonus points through co-operative skillshots).</p><p style="">To promote the game, a short freeware game, titled <a data-ref-id="3030-34081" href="/duty-calls-the-calm-before-the-storm/3030-34081/">Duty Calls: The Calm Before the Storm</a>, was released on February 2, 2011. It is a parody of the <a data-ref-id="3025-1258" href="/modern-warfare/3025-1258/">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</a> series and takes the series' tropes to their most simplistic, absurd extremes (especially their reliance on scripted gameplay events).

The environments are set up with many deadly objects like spikes, open electrical generators, exploding barrels, burning cars etc.</p><p style="">Points accumulated from Skill Shots can then be used to purchases <a data-ref-id="3015-133" href="/upgradeable-weapons/3015-133/">upgrades</a> for all the weapons and the leash. The upgrade system seems to be similar to the one found in the <a href="../../ratchet-clank/62-411/" rel="nofollow">Ratchet and Clank series,</a> where upgrades not only improve base stats but also allow for special abilities unique to each gun.</p><h3>Weapons</h3><p style="">Players can use these weapons in many creative ways to get different kinds of skill shots. In addition to the following arsenal, players can always use the default <a href="../../melee/92-444/" rel="nofollow">melee attack</a> (the boot) to kick enemies away.</p><ul><li><b>Energy Leash</b> - This versatile <a href="../../whip/93-327/" rel="nofollow">whip-like</a> energy rope is always available on Grayson's left arm. Players can use it to pull enemies towards themselves, causing the targets to float in slow motion for a limited amount of time. The leash can also be used to interact with most objects in the environment.</li><li><b>Thumper</b> - The leash can be charged and slammed on the ground, causing all nearby targets to be thrown up in the air.</li><li><b>Peace Maker Carbine (PMC)</b> - A basic <a href="../../assault-rifle/93-413/" rel="nofollow">assault rifle</a> can be modified with attachments. The PMC also be charged in order to fire a single burst of 100 rounds which will leave little more than a glowing skeleton behind. The gun also has an <a href="../../iron-sights/92-567/" rel="nofollow">ironsight mode</a>, similar to red-dot scopes in most modern military shooters.</li><li><b>Screamer</b> - A powerful <a href="../../revolver/93-1021/" rel="nofollow">revolver</a> capable of one-hit kills. The charged shot is a firework that sets nearby enemies on fire.</li><li><b>Minigun</b> - A standard <a href="../../gatling-gun/93-288/" rel="nofollow">gatling gun</a> with a high rate of fire. Carrying the gun slows down player movement.</li><li><b>Boneduster</b> - Four-barrel <a href="../../shotgun/93-114/" rel="nofollow">shotgun</a> that shoots high-impact air and pushes enemies away at great speed. The charged shot incinerates the target with super-heated air.</li><li><b>Flail Gun</b> - The flail fun fires two <a href="../../grenade/93-111/" rel="nofollow">grenades</a> tied together by a chain. The grenade explosion is delayed by default. The charged fire superheats the chain, causing it to burn and instantly cut through enemies.</li><li><b>Bouncer</b> - A portable <a href="../../cannonball/93-3960/" rel="nofollow">cannonball launcher</a>. The plasma grenade can be charged up to bounce around before a delayed detonation.</li><li><b>Headhunter</b> - Bulletstorm's stock <a href="../../sniper-rifle/93-67/" rel="nofollow">sniper-rifle</a>. It fires slow-mo bullets that can be manually directed, the charge fire will allow the user to pick up and carry an enemy with the bullet before being manually detonated.</li><li><b>Penetrator</b> - A gun which fires rocket propelled drills, once imbedded into an enemy they are thrown across the room and impaled on surfaces. The charge shot is able to designate a second target for the drill after it has hit one enemy, also once the shot is charged, running into an enemy causes them to explode.</li></ul><h2>Skill Shots</h2><p style="">Every weapon in the game has its own set of Skillshots, with additional melee skill shots for the leash and kicks. There are also team and multiplayer skill shots. Some boss fights also feature their own unique set of skill shots. According to producer <a data-ref-id="3040-87347" href="/tanya-jessen/3040-87347/">Tanya Jessen</a>, the total number of skill shots is currently running in the hundreds.</p><p style="">All Skillshots scale with the number of enemies simultaneously killed by it.

The main character is <a data-ref-id="3005-14733" href="/grayson-hunt/3005-14733/">Grayson Hunt</a>, an abrasive roughneck <a data-ref-id="3015-445" href="/pirates/3015-445/">space pirate</a> that is out for <a data-ref-id="3015-1363" href="/revenge/3015-1363/">revenge</a> against his former commanding officer, <a data-ref-id="3005-18160" href="/victor-sarrano/3005-18160/">General Victor Sarrano</a> of the Confederation of Planets.</p><p style="">The game begins with Hunt brutally killing a <a data-ref-id="3015-6234" href="/bounty-hunter/3015-6234/">bounty hunter</a> who was trying to kill him and his crew. The crew is being hunted by the space confederation and have been branded as traitors. Their ship stumbles upon the <i>Ulysses</i>, a giant confederate ship commanded by Sarrano. Drunk and filled with rage, Hunt orders the ship to be attacked, resulting in both ships crash landing on a tourism planet. Hunt blacks out and the game goes to a flashback where him and his crew were still working for Sarrano and had to assassinate a man called <a data-ref-id="3005-17366" href="/trishka-novak/3005-17366/">Novak</a>. After killing him, the crew discovers that Novak was not the arms dealer he was said to be but really a journalist who had found incriminating data against Sarrano. All this time, Hunt had been murdering innocent people without knowing it, and his crew decided to desert the army.</p><p style="">The game flashes back to present day where <a data-ref-id="3005-14734" href="/ishi-sato/3005-14734/">Ishi Sato</a>, a member of Hunt's crew, has been severely injured by the crash. To save his life, Sato is turned into an <a data-ref-id="3015-692" href="/android/3015-692/">android</a>, and the rest of the crew is murdered by the savages who inexplicably have control over the planet. After escaping the savages, Sato blames Hunt for his condition and all that has happened to them. Wanting to make things better, Hunt searches for a stranded soldier nearby that could lead to a ticket off planet. The two track the soldier via <a data-ref-id="3055-327" href="/whip/3055-327/">the leash</a> that Hunt found near one of the <i>Ulysses</i>' escape pods. They eventually reach the crash site and find that she goes by the name of <a data-ref-id="3005-17366" href="/trishka-novak/3005-17366/">Trishka</a>. The two manage to convince her to lead them to Sarrano, who has crash landed on the tallest building of the city. Trishka doesn't know that Hunt and Sato want to kill Sarrano, and our two charming protagonists plot to to kill her once the dropship arrives, for no particular reason.</p><p style="">As the three trek to Sarrano's location, a bond builds between them and Hunt begins to think that maybe what they are doing isn't morally correct. Sato doesn't care as the <a data-ref-id="3015-218" href="/artificial-intelligence/3015-218/">A.I.</a> in his body begins to take control. The crew finally make it to Sarrano, who pushes Trishka off the building to her death and strikes a deal with Hunt and Sato. Sarrano promises to get them safely off world except that first they must disarm a DNA bomb situated inside the crashed <i>Ulysses</i> that is programmed to go off in a matter of hours. As the three head towards the crashed ship, Serano reveals that the local mutants originated from the planet's radiation storms. The planet used to have shields preventing such storms but the badly treated convict workers destroyed them. This lead to the "mutification" of all the tourists on the planet. Furthermore, all of the planet's inmates were being held underground near nuclear waste, leading to further mutations. As the three advance, Sarrano and Hunt debate on who is the biggest mass murderer since this whole mess is partly Hunt's fault, and partly Sarrano's.</p><p style="">The three finally make it back to the <i>Ulysses</i>, but when it comes time to deactivate the DNA bomb, Sarrano betrays the two and runs off to the <a data-ref-id="3055-640" href="/dropship/3055-640/">dropship</a> while <i>activating</i> the bomb, which was actually dormant before they arrived. When all hope seems lost, Trishka saves the day explaining that she survived by grabbing hold of a power-line on her way down. The three manage to make it to the dropship and kill most of Sarrano's elite troops and make it to the man himself. There it is revealed that Sarrano ordered Trishka's father, Novak, killed and that Hunt was the man who pulled the trigger. Trishka forgives Hunt, but Sarrano somehow takes control of Sato, who is killed, and Hunt hangs Sarrano on the wall by throwing a spear through him. However, Sarrano survives and locks both Trishka and Hunt in the holding bay and sends them back onto the planet. There the two sprint for the remaining escape pod inside the <i>Ulysses</i> and make it off planet just as the DNA bomb goes off and kills all the mutants. Hunt feels remorse, as it is his fault that all his friends died. Trishka and Hunt decide to work together to get revenge on Sarrano.</p><p style="">However, in an after-credit <a data-ref-id="3015-22" href="/cutscene/3015-22/">cutscene</a>, it is revealed that Sato <i>did</i> survive, but that Sarrano, who somehow survived, rebuilt him so that he could be the General's slave by making him become more <a data-ref-id="3055-230" href="/robot/3055-230/">robot</a> than man.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><table class="t-editor with-border full-width"><tbody><tr><th>Track #</th><th>Song Title</th><th>Running Time</th></tr><tr><td>1.</td><td><b>Bulletstorm Theme</b></td><td>2:34</td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td><b>Quit Being Cute</b></td><td>2:11</td></tr><tr><td>3.</td><td><b>A Moment Of Luck In The Sea Of Misfortune</b></td><td>2:22</td></tr><tr><td>4.</td><td><b>The Mistaken Signals</b></td><td>1:30</td></tr><tr><td>5.</td><td><b>The Storm</b></td><td>2:32</td></tr><tr><td>6.</td><td><b>Hostiles On Our Tail</b></td><td>2:10</td></tr><tr><td>7.</td><td><b>Trishka Fails</b></td><td>2:20</td></tr><tr><td>8.</td><td><b>The Brakes Are Out</b></td><td>2:42</td></tr><tr><td>9.</td><td><b>Hekatonus</b></td><td>2:36</td></tr><tr><td>10.</td><td><b>A Way Through</b></td><td>2:27</td></tr><tr><td>11.</td><td><b>No Sudden Movement</b></td><td>2:07</td></tr><tr><td>12.</td><td><b>Far Side Of The Cavern</b></td><td>2:02</td></tr><tr><td>13.</td><td><b>Skull Hunting Party</b></td><td>2:58</td></tr><tr><td>14.</td><td><b>A Giant Cloud Of Impending Doom</b></td><td>1:15</td></tr><tr><td>15.</td><td><b>Gotta Be An Out</b></td><td>1:27</td></tr><tr><td>16.</td><td><b>My Cyborg Components</b></td><td>2:11</td></tr><tr><td>17.</td><td><b>Bound To End</b></td><td>2:26</td></tr><tr><td>18.</td><td><b>Rumors Were True</b></td><td>1:07</td></tr><tr><td>19.</td><td><b>Soaking The Ambiance</b></td><td>2:36</td></tr><tr><td>20.</td><td><b>Cave</b></td><td>2:13</td></tr><tr><td>21.</td><td><b>Mecha-dzilla</b></td><td>1:47</td></tr><tr><td>22.</td><td><b>This One Last Time</b></td><td>4:54</td></tr><tr><td>23.</td><td><b>Too Many To Kill Them All</b></td><td>3:03</td></tr><tr><td>24.</td><td><b>Fueled Up &amp; Leaving Stygia</b></td><td>2:37</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>PC System Requirements</h2><h3><u>Minimum</u></h3><h3>Main</h3><ul><li><b>Operating System</b>: Windows XP (SP3), Windows Vista (SP2), or Windows 7</li><li><b>Processor</b>: Intel Core 2 Duo, AMD Athlon X2, or equivalent, running at 1.6 GHz or greater</li><li><b>RAM Memory</b>: 1.5 GB</li><li><b>HDD Space</b>: 9 GB available</li><li><b>Video Card</b>: DirectX 9.0c compatible, 256 MB of VRAM; NVIDIA GeForce 7600 GS, ATI Radeon HD 2400 Pro 256 MB, or greater</li><li><b>Sound Card</b>: DirectX 9.0c compatible, 16-bit</li></ul><h3>Others</h3><ul><li>Disc Drive 16X CD/DVD Drive</li><li>Network Internet (TCP/IP) connection</li></ul><h3><u>Recommended</u></h3><h3>Main</h3><ul><li><b>Operating System</b>: Windows Vista (SP2), or Windows 7</li><li><b>Processor</b>: QuadCore 2.0 GHz</li><li><b>RAM Memory</b>: 2 GB</li><li><b>HDD Space</b>: 9 GB available</li><li><b>Video Card</b>: DirectX 9.0c compatible, 512MB of VRAM; NVIDIA GeForce GTX260, or ATI Radeon 4870</li><li><b>Sound Card</b>: DirectX 9.0c compatible, 16-bit</li></ul><h3>Others</h3><ul><li>Disc Drive 16X CD/DVD Drive</li><li>Network Broadband Inter (TCP/IP) connection</li></ul><h2>Xbox 360 Game Installation</h2><p style="">When installed on the Xbox 360 Hard Drive, the game takes up 5.0GB of space.

The Ash Saga comes to a close as more than 30 characters face off against each other in 3-on-3 combat.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style=""><i>The King of Fighters XIII</i> is the latest game in the <a href="/the-king-of-fighters/3025-407/" data-ref-id="3025-407"> KOF</a> series. It was released to arcades on July 14, 2010, coming a little more than a year after its predecessor, <a href="/the-king-of-fighters-xii/3030-21519/" data-ref-id="3030-21519"> The King of Fighters XII</a>. Addressing widespread complaints regarding the bare-bones nature of KOF XII, KOF XIII adds several new characters and more in-depth subsystems.</p><p style="">It is the climax of the Ash Saga, which began in <a href="/the-king-of-fighters-2003/3030-18240/" data-ref-id="3030-18240"> The King of Fighters 2003</a>.</p><p style="">KOF XIII marks the HD debut of <a href="/mai-shiranui/3005-182/" data-ref-id="3005-182"> Mai Shiranui</a>, <a href="/king/3005-4363/" data-ref-id="3005-4363"> King</a>, <a href="/yuri-sakazaki/3005-3492/" data-ref-id="3005-3492"> Yuri Sakazaki</a>, <a href="/takuma-sakazaki/3005-3389/" data-ref-id="3005-3389"> Takuma Sakazaki</a>, <a href="/vice/3005-3461/" data-ref-id="3005-3461"> Vice</a>, <a href="/k/3005-220/" data-ref-id="3005-220"> K'</a>, <a href="/maxima/3005-2230/" data-ref-id="3005-2230"> Maxima</a> and <a href="/kula-diamond/3005-3495/" data-ref-id="3005-3495"> Kula Diamond</a>. <a href="/hwa-jai/3005-9390/" data-ref-id="3005-9390"> Hwa Jai</a>, who hasn't been a competitor since the original <a href="/"> Fatal Fury</a>, makes his KOF debut in this game.</p><p style="">According to the development team, KOF XIII's theme is "KOF-ism," or capturing the "heart" of previous KOF entries. In line with this train of thought, most of the returning characters resemble their earliest forms. For example, Vice wears her business attire from '95 and assumes her stance from '96, and King's stance and moveset comes from Art of Fighting. For the first time in franchise history, <a href="/athena-asamiya/3005-3493/" data-ref-id="3005-3493"> Athena Asamiya</a> does not change outfits between games, merely receiving a paletteswap of her KOF XII costume.</p><h2>Arcade Hardware</h2><p style="">The game uses <a href="/square-enix/3010-104/" data-ref-id="3010-104">Square Enix</a>'s <a href="/taito-corporation/3010-135/" data-ref-id="3010-135">Taito Type X2</a> arcade system hardware:</p><ul><li>OS: Microsoft Windows XP Embedded</li><li>CPU: Intel Core 2 Duo E6400</li><li>Chipset: Intel Q965 + ICH8</li><li>Monitor: 720p/1080p/1440p HD LCD monitor</li><li>RAM: DDR2 667/800MHz (1-4 GB)</li><li>GPU: PCI Express x16-based graphics.

The game was released by Atlus in North America on November 22, 2011. The game was released in Japan on December 1, 2011 by SNK Playmore themselves. Rising Star Games released the title in Europe on November 25, 2011.</p><p style="">The console version features ten modes. In addition to the Arcade and Training modes available in the arcade version, the game features a more in-depth Story Mode, Missions, and a Tutorial for new players. There is also console-exclusive characters; with <a href="/billy-kane/3005-3758/" data-ref-id="3005-3758"> Billy Kane</a> and <a href="/saiki/3005-15951/" data-ref-id="3005-15951"> Saiki</a> appearing as unlockables, and three more characters appearing as DLC. In addition, several new stages are included. According to Matsushita's twitter, the concept behind the new stages are <i>"Release previous KOF backgrounds and new backgrounds in beautiful HD quality."</i></p><p style="">One new addition to the game is the ability to change the button configuration from the character select screen. This is done by pressing the Circle Button on the PS3 or the B button on the Xbox 360. The default button layout is similar to Capcom's fighting games. Also, the game can be installed to the HDD to decrease the length of load times.</p><p style="">SNK Playmore stated that the online play would be an improvement over The King of Fighters XII's and was their number one priority. There is no English dub for the game, but the text is translated into English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Chinese and Korean.</p><p style="">The game offers downloadable content, including three new characters. These characters, Iori with the Power of Flames, NESTS saga Kyo, and Mr. Karate, are each priced at $5/400msp and include a full set of trials, unique stage based on a previous game, and a custom theme song.</p><h2>iPhone Release</h2><p style="">The game was released on the iOS on July 7, 2011 under the name <i>The King of Fighters-i</i>. The game retains most of the same gameplay mechanics as the arcade version. At launch, fourteen playable characters (Team Japan, Team Fatal Fury, Team K', Team Women Fighters, Ash and Billy Kane) were available. On September 9, six more characters (Team Yagami, Team Elizabeth) were added to the roster. There are twelve stages available, with more now available, in the game with some from the arcade version and new designs from older games.</p><p style="">There are four playable modes which include Team and Single Battles, Endless, and Training mode. Players can also play against each other in Bluetooth mode.</p><p style="">The game uses touch screen controls, similar to Street Fighter IV Volt, but doesn't use the same four button layout as other SNK fighters. There is one button for punches, kicks, special moves, evades, and one for Hyper Drive activation.</p><p style="">There are unlockables in the game which include trading cards with original artwork, concept art, and team stories that can be read.</p><h2>PC Release</h2><p style="">On August 19th, 2013, a pre-order page for King of Fighters XIII appeared on <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/steam/3015-718/" data-ref-id="3015-718">Steam</a> with a release date of September 13th, priced £22.99. A limited closed beta was also announced, limited to 300 people chosen through a lottery system via the game's official website.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style="">The previous canonical game, <a href="/the-king-of-fighters-xi/3030-5030/" data-ref-id="3030-5030"> The King of Fighters XI</a>, ended with the death of <a href="/magaki/3005-4321/" data-ref-id="3005-4321"> Magaki</a>, a member of "Those From the Past." Elsewhere, Ash Crimson defeated <a href="/iori-yagami/3005-1014/" data-ref-id="3005-1014"> Orochi Iori</a> and claimed his Sacred Treasure, and it was revealed that <a href="/rose-bernstein/3005-17475/" data-ref-id="3005-17475"> Rose Bernstein</a> is under <a href="/botan/3005-16018/" data-ref-id="3005-16018"> Botan</a>'s control.</p><p style="">It's no surprise that another KOF tournament is announced, with Rose as its sponsor. The leader of Those From the Past, <a href="/saiki/3005-15951/" data-ref-id="3005-15951"> Saiki</a>, plans to use this tournament to start the final phase of his plan. But what is he trying to accomplish? And what role will Ash Crimson play?</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style=""><i>KOF XIII</i> does away with many of the changes made by KOF XII and the other Ash Saga games. The overall gameplay speed has been increased, placing it in line with previous entries in the series; the super meter also returns to <a href="../../the-king-of-fighters-2002-challenge-to-ultimate-battle/61-7581/" rel="nofollow"> KOF 2002's</a> 3-to-5 stock system. Critical Counter and Guard Attacks have been done away with completely, and camera zoom-ins only occur during certain animations.</p><p style="">The game's main gimmick is the <b>Hyper Drive Meter</b>. <b>Drive Cancels</b> allow the player to cancel an Special Move into another Special Move which costs 50% of the Hyper Drive Meter. <b>Super Cancels</b> allow players to cancel a Special Move into a Desperation Move which also costs 50% of the Hyper Drive Meter. Additionally, once the Hyper Drive Meter is filled, <b>Hyper Drive Mode</b> allows the player to perform unlimited <b>HD Cancels</b> for a short time.</p><p style="">This game also introduces <b>EX Special Moves</b>, <b>EX Desperation Moves</b>, and <b>Neo Max Desperation Moves</b>. EX Specials work similar to EX moves in <a href="/street-fighter-iii-new-generation/3030-21948/" data-ref-id="3030-21948"> Street Fighter III</a> and <a href="/street-fighter-iv/3030-20456/" data-ref-id="3030-20456"> IV</a>, giving special moves additional advantageous properties at the cost of one stock of Super Meter. EX Desperation Moves do the same for DMs, while increasing the cost of the attack to two stocks. Neo Max moves, the strongest moves in the game, require three stocks of Super Meter and either a full HD meter or Hyper Drive Mode (as of the console version, the cost is reduced to two stocks if performed from HD Mode). Neo Max moves can be canceled into during combos by using <b>Max Cancel</b> (which is essentially the Dream Cancel from The King of Fighters XI).</p><p style="">The game also includes other subsystems that have become KOF standard, including the Jump/Super Jump/Short Hop/Hyper Hop system, rolls, Guard Cancel knockdowns, among others.</p><h3>Other Features</h3><p style="">Several new stages have been created, and some from XII have been improved. Predefined teams return, along with team themes. Each character has ten color choices (fifteen for the console version) that are selected from a mini-menu, like <a href="../../blazblue-calamity-trigger/61-21768/" rel="nofollow"> BlazBlue</a>; some characters also have an additional hidden set of color choices. As a throwback to earler SNK games, King's and Yuri Sakazaki's tops are destroyed when they are finished off by a special or DM.</p><h3>Revisions</h3><p style="">There will be three "versions" of KOF XIII as of the console release. Version 1.0 of the game had several glitches, some of them game-breaking. These were addressed in Version 1.1, which was released after the <i>Super Battle Opera</i> fighting game tournament.</p><p style="">The console version will receive a complete rebalance, including the aforementioned cost reduction for Neo Max moves. This rebalance, along with the console-exclusive characters, will be ported back to arcades as</p><p style=""><b>The King of Fighters XIII Climax</b></p><p style="">.</p><h2>Gameplay Modes</h2><h3>Arcade</h3><p style="">The standard single player mode that is featured in most fighting games. There are six stages; then, depending on certain conditions, the player will either receive the game's "bad ending" or go on to fight the two boss characters. Each round starts with a short conversation between the two participating characters, a feature last seen in <a href="../../svc-chaos-snk-vs-capcom/61-8521/" rel="nofollow"> SVC Chaos</a>. During the match, "Target Actions" appear; these are small tasks like "Roll 3 times" or "Perform an EX attack" that grant the player in-match benefits such as stock to the Hyper Drive Meter and Super Meter.</p><h3>Story</h3><p style="">Deep story mode explaining the final part of the Ash saga presented in a visual novel format (akin to BlazBlue story mode). There are three perspectives to choose: <a href="/ash-crimson/3005-5601/" data-ref-id="3005-5601"> Ash</a>, <a href="/adelheid-bernstein/3005-3247/" data-ref-id="3005-3247"> Adelheid</a>, and <a href="/heidern/3005-3422/" data-ref-id="3005-3422"> Heidern</a>.</p><h3>Versus</h3><p style="">Split up into team battle (three versus three) or single battle (one versus one). Stages can be selected and handicaps can be set. When the match is over, players can immediately go do a rematch, change the order of the team, or go back to the character select screen and choose a different team.</p><p style="">There are five levels for the handicap, which are:</p><ul><li>Level 1 - HP 50%</li><li>Level 2 - HP 75%</li><li>Level 3 - Normal</li><li>Level 4 - P + 1 - HD 50% (Power meter has 1 stock and 50% stock of Hyper Drive Meter)</li><li>Level 5 - P - HD MAX (Power meter and Hyper Drive Meter are at full stock)</li></ul><h3>Tutorial</h3><p style="">An introduction to The King of Fighters. This explains the basic mechanics and the multiple gauges.</p><h3>Practice</h3><p style="">A mode which allows players to test their combos and strategies against a dummy opponent. This mode is available in the arcade version by holding down the attack buttons while pressing Start, but is restricted by a time limit. A number of options can be manipulated for the AI dummy such as action, guard, counter hit, attack and passive mode. Also, the gauges in the game (Hyper Drive Meter and Super Meter) can be adjusted as well. By default, the Back/Select button displays the command input for the playable fighter, but this can be changed as well to either reset back to default positions, move the dummy forward or jump.</p><h3>Gallery</h3><ul><li><b>Visual -</b> This mode allows players to view artwork, endings, and videos from the game.</li><li><b>Sound -</b> Grants the ability to listen to BGM, voices for each character and the system voice.</li><li><b>Invitation</b></li></ul><h3>Mission</h3><p style="">This is split into three modes:</p><ul><li><b>Time attack</b> - "Fight against the CPU under fixed regulations and try to get the fastest clear time."</li><li><b>Survival</b> - "Keep fighting against the CPU opponents until you run out of health."</li><li><b>Trial</b> - "Challenge a variety of character-specific missions." (This mode is akin to the Challenge mode in BlazBlue)</li></ul><h3>Online</h3><p style="">Players will be able to complete globally in either ranked or player matches along with friend match. After the match, replays can be saved and uploaded.</p><ul><li><b>Ranked Match</b> - "Prove your strength under specified regulations. Your results will be recorded in the Rankings."</li><li><b>Player Match</b> - "Fight under a variety of rules. You can also invite a good friend to play with. Your results will not be recorded in the Rankings."</li><li><b>Friends Match</b> - "Check invites from your friends."</li><li><b>Rankings</b></li></ul><h3><b>Replay</b></h3><p style="">Online matches can be downloaded and saved. When viewing matches, players can choose to frame advance, pause, or skip the round during playback.</p><h3>Customize</h3><ul><li><b>Profile -</b> "Select which items to show in your profile." The online profile allows players to make a default team for online use, add an icon and a short message to display online. Just like colours, icons will be unlocked through playing the game.</li><li><b>Character -</b> "Edit characters' custom colours." Each character can have up to five custom colour schemes. When changing colours, the region that will be adjusted will glow when selected. When a colour is selected for that specific region, the game will adjust to that colour and use the proper shade instead of having to adjust each individual shade, as in The King of Fighters XI. Colours will be unlocked as players progress through the game with each respective fighter.</li></ul><h3>Player Data</h3><p style="">Statistics of wins and losses from online play. Also keeps track total play time along with high score in arcade mode plus percentage completed of trials and unlocks in the gallery.</p><h2>Stages</h2><p style="">The stages available in the game (with more to be confirmed) include:</p><ul><li>Japan</li><li>India</li><li>United Kingdom</li><li>Brazil</li><li>Egypt</li><li>China</li><li>France</li><li>America</li><li>Rose Stadium</li><li>Destroyed Rose Stadium</li><li>Rose Stage (Misted)</li><li>Desert (Console version)</li><li>Clock Tower (Console version)</li><li>PaoPao Cafe (Console version)</li><li>Micky's Stage (Console version)</li><li>Kyokugen-ryu Dojo (Console version)</li><li>Rose Stadium Rooftop (Console version)</li><li>Destroyed Manor (Console version)</li><li>Sky Noah (Console version)</li><li>Those From The Past Headquarters (Console version)</li><li>Rival Team Stage '95 (Console version, DLC)</li><li>Japan Team / Psycho Soldier Team Stage '96 (Console version, DLC)</li><li>Mr. Karate Stage AOF (Console version, DLC)</li></ul><h2>Characters</h2><h3>Elisabeth Team</h3><ul><li><a href="/elisabeth-blanctorche/3005-3503/" data-ref-id="3005-3503"> Elisabeth Blanctorche</a></li><li><a href="/shen-woo/3005-3516/" data-ref-id="3005-3516"> Shen Woo</a></li><li><a href="/duo-lon/3005-3500/" data-ref-id="3005-3500"> Duo Lon</a></li></ul><h3>Japan Team</h3><ul><li><a href="/kyo-kusanagi/3005-197/" data-ref-id="3005-197"> Kyo Kusanagi</a></li><li><a href="/benimaru-nikaido/3005-3399/" data-ref-id="3005-3399"> Benimaru Nikaido</a></li><li><a href="/goro-daimon/3005-3745/" data-ref-id="3005-3745"> Goro Daimon</a></li></ul><h3>Yagami Team</h3><ul><li><a href="/iori-yagami/3005-1014/" data-ref-id="3005-1014"> Iori Yagami</a></li><li><a href="/mature/3005-3460/" data-ref-id="3005-3460"> Mature</a></li><li><a href="/vice/3005-3461/" data-ref-id="3005-3461"> Vice</a></li></ul><h3>Fatal Fury Team</h3><ul><li><a href="/terry-bogard/3005-34/" data-ref-id="3005-34"> Terry Bogard</a></li><li><a href="/andy-bogard/3005-56/" data-ref-id="3005-56"> Andy Bogard</a></li><li><a href="/joe-higashi/3005-228/" data-ref-id="3005-228"> Joe Higashi</a></li></ul><h3>Art of Fighting Team</h3><ul><li><a href="/ryo-sakazaki/3005-3490/" data-ref-id="3005-3490"> Ryo Sakazaki</a></li><li><a href="/robert-garcia/3005-111/" data-ref-id="3005-111"> Robert Garcia</a></li><li><a href="/takuma-sakazaki/3005-3389/" data-ref-id="3005-3389"> Takuma Sakazaki</a></li></ul><h3>Kim Team</h3><ul><li><a href="/kim-kaphwan/3005-209/" data-ref-id="3005-209"> Kim Kaphwan</a></li><li><a href="/hwa-jai/3005-9390/" data-ref-id="3005-9390"> Hwa Jai</a></li><li><a href="/raiden/3005-5233/" data-ref-id="3005-5233"> Raiden</a></li></ul><h3>Women Fighters Team</h3><ul><li><a href="/mai-shiranui/3005-182/" data-ref-id="3005-182"> Mai Shiranui</a></li><li><a href="/yuri-sakazaki/3005-3492/" data-ref-id="3005-3492"> Yuri Sakazaki</a></li><li><a href="/king/3005-4363/" data-ref-id="3005-4363"> King</a></li></ul><h3>K' Team</h3><ul><li><a href="/k/3005-220/" data-ref-id="3005-220"> K'</a></li><li><a href="/kula-diamond/3005-3495/" data-ref-id="3005-3495"> Kula Diamond</a></li><li><a href="/maxima/3005-2230/" data-ref-id="3005-2230"> Maxima</a></li></ul><h3>Psycho Soldier Team</h3><ul><li><a href="/athena-asamiya/3005-3493/" data-ref-id="3005-3493"> Athena Asamiya</a></li><li><a href="/sie-kensou/3005-3122/" data-ref-id="3005-3122"> Sie Kensou</a></li><li><a href="/chin-gentsai/3005-3746/" data-ref-id="3005-3746"> Chin Gentsai</a></li></ul><h3>Ikari Warriors Team</h3><ul><li><a href="/leona-heidern/3005-3426/" data-ref-id="3005-3426"> Leona</a></li><li><a href="/ralf-jones/3005-1139/" data-ref-id="3005-1139"> Ralf Jones</a></li><li><a href="/clark-steel/3005-1140/" data-ref-id="3005-1140"> Clark Steel</a></li></ul><h3>Other</h3><ul><li><a href="/ash-crimson/3005-5601/" data-ref-id="3005-5601"> Ash Crimson</a> (with "Evil Ash" as the final boss)</li><li><a href="/saiki/3005-15951/" data-ref-id="3005-15951"> Saiki</a> (unplayable sub-boss)</li></ul><h3>Console/Climax-Exclusive</h3><ul><li><a href="/billy-kane/3005-3758/" data-ref-id="3005-3758"> Billy Kane</a></li><li>"Normal" Saiki</li><li>Iori "with the Power of Flames" (DLC)</li><li>"NESTS" Kyo (DLC)</li><li>Mr. Karate (DLC)</li></ul><h2>Soundtracks</h2><p style="">Atlus and Rising Star Games offered a pre-order bonus for the game which is a compilation of music from all the King of Fighters games entitled "The King of Soundtracks."

This is <a data-ref-id="3010-82" href="/ubisoft-entertainment/3010-82/">            Ubisoft</a>'s first foray in the skateboarding genre. The game will be released for the 2010 holiday season, for the <a data-ref-id="3045-35" href="/playstation-3/3045-35/">            Playstation 3</a>, <a data-ref-id="3045-20" href="/xbox-360/3045-20/">            Xbox 360</a>, <a data-ref-id="3045-94" href="/pc/3045-94/">            PC</a> and <a data-ref-id="3045-36" href="/wii/3045-36/">            Wii </a>consoles. The game will also be the first of games Published by Ubisoft not ship with a instruction manual and instead use a digital manual. <br />  <br /> The game features many innovative gameplay elements. The most notable one would be the shaping tools that the player is given. This allows the player to bend rails that can lead them to new locations and allow them to chain together more tricks. Similarly, the player can also create vert ramps in certain areas. The objects that the player can manipulate are indicated by a green color. <br /> <br />In the game, you play as a skater in a dark, colorless city. As you land tricks and complete challenges, you inspire the citizens and bring color back to the city. Landing tricks will add color back to the immediate area around them. However, certain areas can only be colored once you reach a certain level. The game will also feature a 3D mode. <br /> <br />The game's controls are following the trend of mapping controls onto the right stick. As the player advances, he will gain access to more and more tricks. The game will also feature an auto trick button for beginners, which will be the X button, that will pull off bigger and better tricks as the player advances.

After taking a break from development duties, the original developer <a data-ref-id="3010-1136" href="/zipper-interactive/3010-1136/">Zipper Interactive</a> once again took the reigns for this iteration of the series. The game was initially slated to be released in fall 2010, but was delayed until April 19th, 2011. This is the second SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs game released for the PlayStation 3, and the 10th in the series. Players have the option of playing the game using either a traditional controller or the <a data-ref-id="3015-4669" href="/playstation-move-support/3015-4669/">PlayStation Move</a>.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p style="">This game takes place in Southeast Asia, and has the player controlling Ops Commander Cullen Gray. You lead a team of NATO <a data-ref-id="3015-3536" href="/special-forces/3015-3536/">special forces</a> deployed to the Strait of Malacca, which connects the Pacific and Indian Oceans between Indonesia and Malaysia. Your team consists of two Westerners, Wells and Schweitzer, and two South Korean operatives, Chung and Forty-Five, who is female and plays an important role in the campaign.</p><p style="">The game also features "stealth" missions where you play as Forty-Five on her own. Hiding and sticking to the shadows will be a necessity in these levels.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">SOCOM 4 is a squad-based tactical shooter much like previous games in the series. Players can now give orders in real time like issuing squad commands, setting waypoints for teammates, as well being able to use Command Mode to set how many or how to take down enemies on your teammates way to an objective. In real time, the screen will slowly start to gray as you have a choice of options to choose from as the game is still going.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1290929-4407077258_1183090865_o.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1290929" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1290929-4407077258_1183090865_o.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1290929"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1290929-4407077258_1183090865_o.jpg"></a><figcaption>Soldiers taking cover</figcaption></figure><p style="">Throughout the campaign, the player will have to fight through enemies with intense gunfire, as well as using stealth to infiltrate objectives undetected. As players collect intel, air-strikes will be available as well as strafing runs on enemies. The Zipper team has stated they've really foucsed on artificial intelligence in the game, making them better at using cover, as well as flanking and making better choices on the battlefield.</p><h2>Multiplayer</h2><p style="">SOCOM 4 features a robust online set of features, with 32 player counts, 9 maps (10 including the pre-order bonus "Abandoned"), and 4 different modes. All modes are playable on all maps, and players have the ability to create custom matches &amp; playlists. There is an option for 5 player co-op. Other features include full clan support, with the ability to have up to 128 members per clan, as well as unlockable attachments for weapons. Also, team killers will automatically be removed from a game if there are too many friendly fire deaths.</p><p style="">There will be two separate ways to play the online modes:</p><ul><li><u><b>Standard Mode</b></u> - Features unlimited respawns, regenerating health, and the ability to revive teammates.</li><li><u><b>Classic Mode</b></u> - More like the original SOCOM games, which features increased movement speeds, round-based play, no player respawns, and the lack of health regeneration.</li></ul><p style="">The four multiplayer game modes are as follows:</p><h3><u><b>Suppression</b></u></h3><p style="">Your standard game of <a data-ref-id="3015-2463" href="/team-deathmatch/3015-2463/">Team Deathmatch</a>, each team battles each other for the most kills before the time limit expires.</p><h3><u><b>Uplink</b></u></h3><p style="">In this <a data-ref-id="3015-25" href="/capture-the-flag/3015-25/">Capture the Flag</a>-type game mode, members of one team attempt to infiltrate the other team's base in order to capture data, and bring it back to their own base to uplink it.</p><h3><u><b>Last Defense</b></u></h3><p style="">In this unique combination of <a data-ref-id="3015-1099" href="/conquest-mode/3015-1099/">Conquest</a> and <a data-ref-id="3015-3294" href="/assault/3015-3294/">Assault</a>, each team fights to capture three satellite points on the map. Once this is done, they are able to triangulate the position of the opposing team's base, and attack it.</p><h3><u><b>Bomb Squad</b></u></h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/63119/1728744-socom4c.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1728744" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/63119/1728744-socom4c.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1728744"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/63119/1728744-socom4c.jpg"></a><figcaption>The Bomb Technician in action</figcaption></figure><p style="">The insurgent team has a number of bombs around the map, and the Spec Ops team must defuse them all before time runs out. This mode features the "Bomb Technician" character, played by one member of the Spec Ops team, who is charged with defusing the explosives. The Bomb Technician is equipped with heavy armor and an automatic shotgun, and is randomly chosen at the beginning of each game.</p><h2><b>Release Editions &amp; Bonuses</b></h2><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/63119/1724844-71_uexx53zl._aa1500_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1724844" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.42990654205607" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:43.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/63119/1724844-71_uexx53zl._aa1500_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1724844"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/63119/1724844-71_uexx53zl._aa1500_.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/63119/1724844-71_uexx53zl._aa1500_.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Full Deployment Edition</figcaption></figure><p style="">For $149.99, players can buy The Full Deployment Edition which includes:</p><ul><li>SOCOM 4 game</li><li>A PlayStation Move &amp; PlayStation Eye</li><li>A Navigation Controller</li><li>The Sharp Shooter peripheral</li></ul><p style="">If players pre-ordered the game from Gamestop they would be given access to the popular multiplayer map "Abandoned," which is an updated version of the map from the original SOCOM and SOCOM 2.

On March 4th, the full details of the Beta were announced on the PlayStation Blog:</p><blockquote><p style="">The SOCOM 4 Multiplayer Beta will roll out in four separate phases.

The game focuses on fast-paced action where players aim to get the best score possible at the end of every level.</p><p style="">The game was released August 30, 2011, on PS3 and Xbox 360.</p><h2>Development</h2><p style="">Surprisingly, <a data-ref-id="3040-8711" href="/stuart-black/3040-8711/" slug="stuart-black">Stuart Black</a> claims that he got the idea for <i>Bodycount</i> after seeing a <a data-ref-id="3030-27934" href="/lady-gaga-revenge/3030-27934/" slug="lady-gaga-revenge">Lady Gaga</a> concert. He thought that the way she interpreted and sang her music revolutionized pop music. This made him want to do the same thing, but with shooters. He found modern day shooters too bland and wanted to make a game that was "simply about shooting."</p><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/86760/1798865-bodycount_playstation_3_ps3_1306931945_045.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1798865" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.78828125" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:178.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/86760/1798865-bodycount_playstation_3_ps3_1306931945_045.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1798865"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/86760/1798865-bodycount_playstation_3_ps3_1306931945_045.jpg"></a><figcaption>New art style</figcaption></figure><p style="">What must be known about <i>Bodycount</i> is that it's not <i>Black 2</i>. Said game was cancelled by EA after being in development for three years. After leaving Criterion, Stuart Black and other members of the team formed Codemasters Studios Guildford. A 70-man team is working on <i>Bodycount</i> with most of them already having worked on other shooters. In addition, it is not the sequel to obscure, middling shooter <a data-ref-id="3030-9972" href="/operation-body-count/3030-9972/" slug="operation-body-count"><i>Operation Body Count</i></a>, the similarity of the titles being a coincidence.</p><p style="">This game is being designed using Codemasters' own EGO engine which was previously used to power games such as <a data-ref-id="3030-20729" href="/grid/3030-20729/" slug="grid"><i>GRID</i></a> and <a data-ref-id="3030-21665" href="/operation-flashpoint-dragon-rising/3030-21665/" slug="operation-flashpoint-dragon-rising"><i>Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising</i></a>. The engine helps create detailed destruction. For example, you'll be able to "peel off" different layers of a wall by shooting it. Each layer will have its own resistance to your bullets. This engine has also allowed for better A.I. All changes that the team will do on the EGO engine will be kept for future games.</p><p style="">Stuart Black left Codemasters in October 2010 for reasons unknown (rumors have it that he left following a poor showing at E3 2010). The game then went silent and was "rebooted" with a new art style.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">The story is relatively straightforward. You are an agent in a secret government agency and must bring peace to Africa. Of course, you won't be signing any peace treaties, you'll be killing the two warring factions, as well as a third mysterious group who wear sophisticated suits.</p><p style="">The game is built as an arcade shooter. You're rewarded points for building up a combo by shooting people, similar to the system used by <a data-ref-id="3030-18777" href="/the-club/3030-18777/" slug="the-club"><i>The Club</i></a>. There are different classes that get you different amounts of points when you shoot them. For example, wound a soldier and a medic will come. Shooting the medic will net you more points than shooting just the soldier. By killing the entire enemy faction, you'll be able to draw out the faction's general, winning you loads of points. The game also rewards for blowing up the environment, which is fully destructible. Not only are you rewarded points for brutally murdering your opponents, but you also gain intel that can be used for OSBs (see below).</p><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/65194/1857591-00369000.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1857591" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/65194/1857591-00369000.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1857591"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/65194/1857591-00369000.jpg"></a><figcaption>Killing with skill.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The game has an old fashioned health bar with health packs. The game also has a first person cover system, similar to that of <a data-ref-id="3030-20601" href="/killzone-2/3030-20601/" slug="killzone-2"><i>Killzone 2</i></a>'s. The game also lets you lean out of the way of bullets and peak around cover.</p><p style="">The game features an Operative Support Button (OSB) which is mapped to one of 4 directions on the D-pad. Using one of these four assets empties your intel bar, which can be refilled by killing more people. Each OSB can be upgraded. The four OSBs are:</p><ul><li>The adrenaline shot, which grants invincibility for a few secondes and can be upgraded to last longer.</li><li>The explosive rounds, which tear through enemy armor and inflict splash damage.</li><li>The radar, which gives away enemy positions and can be upgraded to emit an EMP shockwave which kills certain enemies.</li><li>The airstrike, which rains death upon enemies and can only be used outside.</li></ul><h2>Levels</h2><ul><li>Enter Tesanga City Streets</li><li>Locate the Militia Warlord</li><li>Investigate Power Signature</li><li>Gather Intelligence on Hidden Bunker</li><li>Contact Major of Local Platoon</li><li>Assassinate the General</li><li>Infiltrate Target Nexus Facility</li><li>Destroy the Target's African Operation</li><li>Escape Africa</li><li>Investigate Connection With the Target</li><li>Find Target Bunker Entrance</li><li>Deactivate Termination Chip</li><li>Locate Target Nexus</li><li>Retrieve Datacore</li><li>Assault Target Weapons Facility</li><li>Locate Datacore/Destroy Target Base</li><li>Final Objective</li></ul><h2>Bodycount Mode</h2><p style="">Bodycount mode is a score attack mode where players replay previous levels and try to get a highscore to compete against others on online leaderboards. This mode focuses on keeping a combo going by executing skillshots and depending on how skillfully you murder enemy bots, you will get a grade at the end of the level.</p><p style="">It should be noted that levels played in Bodycount mode are exactly the same as the ones played in the campaign and that you can only use weapons that had been unlocked at that stage in the campaign.</p><h2>Multiplayer</h2><p style="">Bodycount has a 12 player online competitive multiplayer mode which ranges from standard deathmatch games to more objective based games.</p><p style="">The mode lets you customize your class as well as use OSBs. Here, you earn intel by killing opponents, but also by dying, meaning that less skilled players can still be competitive.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>30313</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/1891337-box_bcount.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/1891337-box_bcount.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/1891337-box_bcount.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/1891337-box_bcount.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/1891337-box_bcount.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1891337-box_bcount.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/1891337-box_bcount.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Bodycount]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>2</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-16/]]></api_detail_url><id>16</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: M]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-12/]]></api_detail_url><id>12</id><name><![CDATA[OFLC: MA15+]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2011-08-30 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/bodycount/3030-30313/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-30328/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2010-03-09 08:32:46</date_added><date_last_updated>2014-11-09 09:57:23</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[Play a guitar controller with real strings in this rhythm game from Seven45 Studios.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<p style="">While the game controller can be played as a real guitar, it has been stated that the game is <b>not</b> a guitar teaching tool.</p><h2>Setlist</h2><p style="">PowerGig: Rise of the SixString comes with 70 tracks.</p><ul><li>Eric Clapton -

Players can <a data-ref-id="3015-155" href="/customizable-characters/3015-155/" slug="customizable-characters">                       customize</a> the look of their fighter, then take them into the fights as they battle their way up the ranks. Players can fight however they like, because in the world of illegal fighting, there are no rules. <br/><h2>Gameplay </h2>In order to play The Fight: Lights Out, players will need two <a href="///"> </a><a data-ref-id="3015-4669" href="/playstation-move-support/3015-4669/" slug="playstation-move-support">                        PlayStation Moves</a>,  one  for each hand. The game offers true one-to-one precision with  every movement of each hand. Players can to throw any type of  punch, grab, or block, and the game will  reflect it onscreen. The <a href="///"> </a><a data-ref-id="3000-24" href="/playstation-eye/3000-24/" slug="playstation-eye">                          PlayStation Eye</a>  not only tracks the Moves, but can also perform  head-tracking, allowing players to duck, bob-n-weave, and  perform head-butts.  <br/>  <br/>The onscreen HUD consists of three meters:  <br/><ul class="plain-list"><li><b>Health Meter</b> - This displays your total health before you're knocked out.</li><li><b>Stamina Meter</b> - This bar goes down as you throw punches, and the more it's depleted, the weaker your punches are and the more prone to you are to take damage. When you stop throwing punches, the meter will begin to fill back up.<br/></li><li><b>Rage Meter</b> - This bar fills up as you take hits, and the higher you rage meter is, the more effective your "dirty moves" will be.</li></ul> <br/>The game also features a fitness tracker, allowing players to keep track of their activity level. At the end of each fight or training session, the game displays the amount of calories burned for that individual session, as well as the total overall calories burned.  <br/><h2>Single Player Campaign </h2> <figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/63119/1626101-new_picture__2_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1626101" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.7030162412993" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:70.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/63119/1626101-new_picture__2_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1626101"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/63119/1626101-new_picture__2_.jpg"></a><figcaption> Danny Trejo as Duke</figcaption></figure><a href="///"> </a><a data-ref-id="3040-63974" href="/danny-trejo/3040-63974/" slug="danny-trejo">        Danny Trejo</a> plays the trainer Duke, who walks the player through the tutorial &amp; campaign in <a data-ref-id="3015-604" href="/full-motion-video/3015-604/" slug="full-motion-video">      FMV</a> <a data-ref-id="3015-604" href="/full-motion-video/3015-604/" slug="full-motion-video"> </a>segments. Players will have to fight their way up the ranks through 12 different venues filled with opponents, and at the end of each venue there is a <a data-ref-id="3015-50" href="/boss-fight/3015-50/" slug="boss-fight">                      boss fight</a>. Each boss has his own arsenal of special moves and abilities, and if the player can defeat the boss, he then gains those abilities to use in subsequent fights.  <br/> <br/>As players progress through the ranks, they will earn money for performing well and winning matches. Money can be used to buy clothing &amp; tattoos, as well as heal injuries. Players will also unlock "dirty moves", which are special moves that can be pulled off by the fighter, but are only most effective with a full rage meter. Fighters will sometimes receive "injuries" to their body as they fight. These  injuries will stay with the fighter unless they are healed after the  match, which costs money.   <br/> <br/>Between fights, players can enter the training room, where they can do things like sparring and hitting speed bags. Doing so will cost players a small amount of money, but they can earn valuable skill points which they can then put towards their abilities.  <br/><h2>Multiplayer  </h2>The Fight has both local splitscreen multiplayer, as well as full online support. Players can also <a data-ref-id="3015-3179" href="/spectating/3015-3179/" slug="spectating">    spectate</a> online matches, and wager bets on who will win.]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>30351</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/6/63119/1620055-915zdxvzy9l._aa1500_.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/63119/1620055-915zdxvzy9l._aa1500_.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/6/63119/1620055-915zdxvzy9l._aa1500_.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/63119/1620055-915zdxvzy9l._aa1500_.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/6/63119/1620055-915zdxvzy9l._aa1500_.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/63119/1620055-915zdxvzy9l._aa1500_.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/6/63119/1620055-915zdxvzy9l._aa1500_.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[The Fight: Lights Out]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>1</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-1/]]></api_detail_url><id>1</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: T]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2010-11-09 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/the-fight-lights-out/3030-30351/]]></site_detail_url></game></results><version>1.0</version></response>
