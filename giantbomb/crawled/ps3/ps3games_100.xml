The game was originally intended to be an <a href="/xbox-360/3045-20/" data-ref-id="3045-20">Xbox 360</a> exclusive but was later ported to the <a href="/playstation-3/3045-35/" data-ref-id="3045-35">PlayStation 3</a> and <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC</a> platforms. The game features a stylish, snowy wasteland setting and very traditional Japanese combat balancing.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11097/281009-ss_48742.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-281009" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11097/281009-ss_48742.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-281009"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11097/281009-ss_48742.jpg"></a><figcaption>Hello, this is Wayne Holden.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The story follows the concept of a man with amnesia, Wayne Holden, who goes on an epic journey to fight a great evil while at the same time regaining parts of his memory to reveal a tragic back story full of heartbreak and betrayal. He eventually has to fight an evil oppressive corporation and the man responsible for his backstabbing/memory loss.</p><h2>Combat</h2><p style="">The combat in Lost Planet is much more complex than the average shooter, with a heavy focus on invincibility windows in animations and carefully timed evasive maneuvers. This gives it much more of a traditional Japanese action game feel than circle-strafe heavy shooters that are commonplace in the Western market.</p><h3>Offense</h3><p style="">The game has different types of attacks, depending on weapon selection, impact distance, evasive timing, and type of weapon used.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/68/207634-lostplanet15.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-207634" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.562" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/68/207634-lostplanet15.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-207634"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/68/207634-lostplanet15.jpg"></a><figcaption>A GAB - 25M "Cakti" in Tank Mode.</figcaption></figure><ul><li><b>Light Attacks</b> - Simply do damage with no interruptions to movement. Includes damage from long distance shots projectile weapons.</li><li><b>Light Stun Attacks</b> - Cause the injured character to stumble or pause for a bit. Includes damage from machine gun fire close range. Can be cancelled by repeatedly clicking the left stick to crouch.</li><li><b>Heavy Stun Attacks</b> - Send the character into a stun animation where they stand in place, usually being electrocuted. Usually the result of a plasma grenade or EM laser.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Stumbling Attacks</b> - Send the character into a stumbling animation, where they are temporarily stunned, but keep moving the the direction they were before. Normally caused by nearby grenade detonation, nearby rocket explosions, or nearby large Akrid movement.</li><li><b>Knockdown Attacks</b> - Knock down the character for a period of time. The character is invincible during this animation, but is placed at a very strategic disadvantage as a result, especially against a player who knows exactly when the invincibility window ends. Attacks include close range explosions, close range shotgun blasts, direct hits from lasers, and several Akrid attacks.</li><li><b>Instant Kill Attacks</b> - Self-explanatory. Instant kill attacks include direct hits from rockets, point blank shotgun blasts, and head shots from sniper or plasma rifles.</li></ul><h3>Defense</h3><p style="">Defensive maneuvering in this game is tantamount to survival. It's important to learn the invincibility windows for all animations in the game, as well as perfectly timing evasive dodges.</p><p style="">The evasive dodge can be done by crouching and pressing the jump button. The player character will dive into a roll that will place them out of the range of most enemy attacks. There is also a very brief invincibility window during the animation. The roll can be successfully used in the following ways:</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/68/207631-lostplanet13.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-207631" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.562" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/68/207631-lostplanet13.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-207631"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/68/207631-lostplanet13.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/68/207631-lostplanet13.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>A PTX - 40A "Ivan"</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Diving out of the way of incoming laser &amp; energy gun attacks.</li><li>Waiting &amp; perfectly timing an evasive dodge away from a homing weapon.</li><li>Diving out of the way of rockets.</li><li>Using the invincibility frames to cancel the explosion of a gum grenade when stuck with one.</li><li>Zig-zagging to evade sniper fire.</li><li>Diving circles around an opponent in a close range battle.</li><li>Evading practically every Akrid attack in the game. All Akrid are designed so that their attacks can be completely evaded by roll-dodging at an exact time.</li></ul><p style="">Mobility is an important thing to take into account while playing, as well. There a trade off in picking up a VS weapon as a human considering it will lead to slower movement, and a long reloading animation that will leave the player vulnerable &amp; stationary. Small exploits can be used to cancel certain reload animations, such as doing a dive roll in the middle of a machine gun reload, or jumping before pressing the reload button when using a regular rocket launcher.</p><h3>Human Opponents</h3><p style="">Human enemies factor across a large majority of the game. They mainly try to stay back and take shots at the player with long range weapons, occasionally moving behind cover. They don't particularly try to flank, flush the player out with grenades, or any kind of advanced maneuvers like that. The challenge in the human enemies comes not from their AI, but from the sheer numbers of them the game throws at the player at all times, both in &amp; out of VS's. In later levels, it's commonplace to encounter sections with over 30 human enemies in and out of VS's and stationary turrets.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/729/228132-0000001918_1024x768.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-228132" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.625" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/729/228132-0000001918_1024x768.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-228132"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/729/228132-0000001918_1024x768.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/729/228132-0000001918_1024x768.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>"He is just one man!"</figcaption></figure><p style="">The on-foot human enemies will typically be equipped with machine guns in the first few levels, while in the later levels having rifles, rocket launchers, energy guns, and plasma guns. While in VS's, the enemies' mobility and weapon power is significantly increased, and they have a tendency to try to quickly circle-strafe you while unloading on the player with a barrage of power weapons. Some quick evasive moves and strong weapons are best in these scenarios.</p><h3>Akrid Opponents</h3><p style="">Akrid opponents, on the other hand, are tackled in an entirely different fashion. The Akrid close the distance on the player as fast as possible, and all have 3 or 4 attacks they cycle between which have very specific methods to avoid. In addition to this, they all have bright orange weak points that must be shot to do damage, as opposed the the humans which can be shot anywhere. This makes the Akrid essentially feel like mini boss battles in themselves, and mixed with human enemies at the same time, add a lot of different variety &amp; tactics to each encounter. The Akrid will also constantly ambush the player from busting out from beneath the snow when you least expect it.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/68/207625-lostplanet7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-207625" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.562" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/68/207625-lostplanet7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-207625"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/68/207625-lostplanet7.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/68/207625-lostplanet7.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>A GTF - 13M vs the Undeep</figcaption></figure><p style="">The game contains several different types of Akrid, but also 2 or 3 size variations on each time. For example, one type, dubbed the "rolly poly" by the online community, appears in a small form throughout the first few levels. A much larger version is also the boss of the first level. However, by the 7th or 8th level, the player is facing several instances of the level 1 boss version, thrown at the player in the same number &amp; patterns as the smaller ones were at the beginning, only with more powerful VS's and weapons at their disposal. This happens will all the different types of Akrid, until the last few levels are a chaotic combination of boss rushes and mech battles in an explosive particle-effect drenched battlefield.</p><p style="">There are also a few single instance Akrid that only appear in particular scenarios in the game and are better off avoided. Those are the worms in level 3, and the moth in level 5.</p><p style="">In an interesting design choice, not a single enemy encounter outside of the boss fights needs to be completed in order to progress. This means that if the player is good enough at avoiding enemies and their attacks, they can simply run past every fight in the game that's not a boss battle. On Extreme difficulty, this becomes a necessity to beat certain parts, as stopping to kill the ridiculously tough enemies will often end in the player either dying or running out of thermal energy.</p><h3>VS Suits</h3><p style="">Vital Suits (VS's for short) are mechs that the player &amp; enemies can pilot throughout the game. They have their own lifebar, and drain thermal energy at a much faster rate than if the player were on foot. The benefit is that they can move while reloading the VS weapons, and can dual wield them.</p><h3>VS Types</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11097/280768-ss_47479.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-280768" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11097/280768-ss_47479.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-280768"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11097/280768-ss_47479.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11097/280768-ss_47479.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>A GAB - 25M "Cakti" in Walker Mode.</figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>DBS-000XM Codename Billion Sword</strong></li><li><strong>GTF-11i Codename Firecracker</strong></li><li><strong>GAB - 25M Codename Cakti</strong></li><li><strong>GAB - 25DM Codename D-Cakti</strong></li><li><strong>GAN - 34 Codename Granseed</strong></li><li><strong>GAN - 37 Codename X-Seed</strong></li><li><strong>GAN - A04SD Codename Cyclops</strong></li><li><strong>GTB - 22 Codename Faze</strong></li><li><strong>GTB - 22CC Codename Faze CC</strong></li><li><strong>GTF - 11 Codename Drio</strong></li><li><strong>GTF - 11CC Codename Drio CC</strong></li><li><strong>GTF - 13F Codename Vensa</strong></li><li><strong>GTF - 13M Codename Evax</strong></li><li><strong>GTN - A01 Codename Turntable</strong></li><li><strong>GTN-A03C Codename Zebet</strong></li><li><strong>GTN-A03M Codename Zebet</strong></li><li><strong>GTT - 01 Codename Nida</strong></li><li><strong>L-P-9999 Codename Yuri</strong></li><li><strong>PTX - 140 Codename Hardballer</strong></li><li><strong>PTX - 40A Codename Ivan</strong></li><li><strong>PTX-40A-2 Codename Heavy Ivan</strong></li></ul><p style="">The PTX-40A also appears in the <a href="/tatsunoko-vs-capcom/3025-1610/" data-ref-id="3025-1610">Tatsunoko vs. Capcom series</a> as a playable character.

Has stun effect in multiplayer. The stun effects can be canceled by repeatedly crouching.</li><li><b>Shotgun</b> - Has a powerful &amp; wide damage arc at close range, but is useless at longer ranges. Can knock down enemies in multiplayer at medium-to-close range, or is a 1 hit kill at point blank.</li><li><b>Rifle <i>(Sniper Weapon)</i></b> - 2 shot kill for any human enemy, or 1 shot kill if a head shot is landed (for single or multiplayer). It is not recommended against Akrid or VS. You're best off saving your ammo for humans.</li><li><b>Rocket Launcher</b> - A powerful weapon, with a stumbling/knockdown splash damage, that is a 1 hit kill against humans if a direct hit is landed. The rocket launcher's immobility during a reload animation can be canceled by first jumping in the air, <i>then</i> reloading.</li><li><b>Plasma Gun <i>(Sniper Weapon)</i></b> - Has similar damage effects to the rifle, but instead of instantly connecting with the target, the plasma gun shots take about a second to travel through the air. This means that at great distances, sniper shots must be led a bit.</li><li><b>Energy Gun <i>(Homing Weapon)</i></b> - A weapon that can be charged up. A fully charged blast will knock people down (or sometimes kill them), and eject people from VS's. A fully charged shot also has heavy homing capabilities. Smaller shots can be used to whittle down an enemy's health.</li></ul><h3>Grenades</h3><p style="">Note that all grenades of any kind can be detonated at any point (midair or otherwise) by being shot.</p><ul><li><b>Hand Grenade</b> - A standard explosive grenade. Works just like in every other game.</li><li><b>Disc Grenade</b> - Flies in an infinite straight line (like a perfect frisbee) until it hits an obstacle, then bounces for a bit. Will stick in enemies. It's useful to tag people who are knocked down, bounce off a wall or ceiling to get a hiding enemy, or thrown across a large distance then detonated to kill far away enemies.</li><li><b>Gum Grenade</b> - A grenade with a very high arc and short distance that sticks to any surface it touches (including VS's &amp; humans). Has a very long timer for detonation, so it's best used to stick to walls to make a trap.</li><li><b>Plasma Grenade</b> - Has a large blast radius that does very little damage, but stuns everything inside the blast. Great for stunning people then shooting them, or one can just repeatedly hit them with plasma grenades until their health eventually whittles down to nothing.</li><li><b>Dummy Grenade</b> - Will create an explosive mannequin-like balloon that floats around, and detonates when shot. The dummy will appear as another dot on players' radars.</li></ul><h3>VS Weapons</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11097/280552-ss_47322.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-280552" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11097/280552-ss_47322.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-280552"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11097/280552-ss_47322.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11097/280552-ss_47322.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>A Snow Pirate vs a GTB - 22 "Faze" in Multiplayer.</figcaption></figure><ul><li><b>Gatling Gun</b> - Has a heavy stun effect on human opponents.</li><li><b>Shotgun</b> - Has a heavy knockdown effect on human opponents, and a longer distance for an instant kill effect.</li><li><b>Cannon</b> - A small splash damage blast that's powerful if an instant hit is connected.</li><li><b>Rocket Launcher</b> - A much larger version than the human rocket launcher. Behaves in the same way.</li><li><b>Missile Launcher</b> - A launcher that fires a series of smaller rockets. They do less damage, but this weapon also does not need to be reloaded after every single shot.</li><li><b>Grenade Launcher</b> - A powerful arc-ing weapon that takes a bit of calculation to aim at distances, but can be lethal in the right hands.</li><li><b>Laser Rifle</b> - Fires a straight laser beam that can be deadly when fully charged. The laser rifle can be charged up by holding in the trigger.</li><li><b>EM Laser</b> - Behaves similarly to the laser rifle, but has a slightly wider area of effect, and is more powerful against VS's. Charging any laser weapon drains thermal energy very quickly.</li><li><b>Homing Laser</b> - Has a total of 4 lock-ons that can be set on 1 to 4 separate targets.

In October 2010 a patch for Move support was released.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Game Modes</strong></h2><h3><strong>Single Player</strong></h3><p style="">PAINdemonium - This is the basic sandbox mode that places you in your human slingshot in different locations of the level. The 4 different setups are PAINdemonium, Block Party, Aftermath, and Demolition. Only PAINdamonium is available at the start and each is unlocked by performing a different task on each level.</p><p style="">Spank the Monkey - The mode places monkeys in different places in the level and requires you hit each monkey in the fastest time possible. There are 4 difficulty levels, and the last difficulty is only unlocked when you obtain platinum medals in the 3 previous difficulties.</p><p style="">Mime Toss - This mode implements the grab function where you grab a hovering mine in front of your launcher and are tasked with hitting panes of glass with the mime. You are awarded medals for the amount of time you take t break every pane of glass. There are 4 difficulty levels, and the last difficulty is only unlocked when you obtain platinum medals in the 3 previous difficulties.</p><p style="">Fun With Explosives - You have 2 turns to launch your player into an explosive box scattered city and you're tasked with hitting as many boxes as you possibly can. There are 4 difficulty levels, and the last difficulty is only unlocked when you obtain platinum medals in the 3 previous difficulties.</p><h3>Multiplayer</h3><p style="">Fun With Explosives - 2-4 players - This game plays the same as the single player mode, except you are trying to beat the score of the player before you. As soon as someones score can't be beat, that player wins.</p><p style="">Bowling - 2 players - This game plays the same as regular bowling, except your player is the ball aimed at oversized pins. The non-bowling player is given 3 "distractions" to shoot off as the other player bowls. The distractions combined with the idea of OOCHing back to the pins when you pass them creates a very intense multiplayer mode.</p><p style="">HORSE - 2-4 players - Once again, the game plays the same as the basketball version of HORSE with a twist. The first player hits and object and then obtains the highest score possible. The next player must first hit that same object then obtain a higher score than the previous player. A letter is given out if the high score is not beaten. The first player the give HORSE (or whatever word you pick. There are no dirty word filters ;) ) to every other player wins.</p><h2><strong>Unlockables</strong></h2><h3><strong>PAINdemonium levels</strong></h3><ul><li>Unlock Aftermath - Score 1.5 million points in the original PAINdemonium mode</li><li>Unlock Block Party - Grab the granny and leave her laying on the subway tracks. The subway will eventually come, run her over, and unlock Block Party</li><li>Unlock Demolition - Bomb the bikini girl 5 times. On the building directly in front of you, there is a grab bomb. Aim directly for it at a high angle, land on top of it and grab it. Super ooch to the left toward the girl talking to the police officer and directly bomb here. If successful, you will get the "Collateral Damage" message. Do this 5 times to unlock Demolition.</li></ul><h3><strong>Characters</strong></h3><ul><li>Ice Tea - Get 50 shots to the junk in the game.</li><li>The Dude - Play a complete game of bowling in multiplayer 12 times.</li><li>Ed the Cow - Blow up the mascot 12 times. In Downtown, grab the bomb just to the left of the launcher. This should blow up the box underneath, launching you into the air. Ooch toward the mascot on the right and bomb him. Rinse and repeat 12 times.</li></ul><h2><strong>Downloadable Content</strong></h2><ul><li>Characters - $0.99 - There are many characters for download, each with it's own soundset and styles. Very worth the money spent.</li><li>Fun With Explosives Single Player - FREE - Due to popular demand, this pack gives you Fun with Explosives mode for single player. Best of all it's free.</li><li>Amusement Park - $5.99</li></ul><p style="">PAIN Labs, a Boom Blox type of setup will be added to the game and will be updated in an unannounced set of time. If something that the dev designed is so crazy they HAVE to show the masses, then you'll see the mini level here.</p><p style="">It is also rumored a zombie will be added for 99 cents and possible celebrity launch-ees for a premium price.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>18059</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/1/15693/623366-939541_87699_front_1_.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15693/623366-939541_87699_front_1_.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/1/15693/623366-939541_87699_front_1_.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15693/623366-939541_87699_front_1_.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/15693/623366-939541_87699_front_1_.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15693/623366-939541_87699_front_1_.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/1/15693/623366-939541_87699_front_1_.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[PAIN]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>5</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-1/]]></api_detail_url><id>1</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: T]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-2/]]></api_detail_url><id>2</id><name><![CDATA[PEGI: 16+]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2007-11-29 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-88/]]></api_detail_url><id>88</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation Network (PS3)]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-network-ps3/3045-88/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3N]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pain/3030-18059/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[MGS3

Set in 1964, the game is different from the first two games in that it is mainly set in a <a href="/jungle/3035-744/" data-ref-id="3035-744">jungle</a> environment. <a href="/stealth/3015-24/" data-ref-id="3015-24">Stealth</a> is very important to the gameplay of Snake Eater due to more advanced <a href="/artificial-intelligence/3015-218/" data-ref-id="3015-218">AI</a> enemies, open environments, and (due to the arcane cold war technology) a lack of detailed, on-screen radars. <a href="/survival/3015-1297/" data-ref-id="3015-1297">Survival</a> - performing minor surgery, bandaging wounds, eating wild animals - is a feature unique to this Metal Gear. <a href="/hideo-kojima/3040-63395/" data-ref-id="3040-63395">Hideo Kojima</a>, creator of the Metal Gear series, directed Snake Eater and the game is generally seen as an answer to the criticism that was given to <a href="/metal-gear-solid-2-sons-of-liberty/3030-12388/" data-ref-id="3030-12388">Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</a>. A new engine was created for Snake Eater in order to create a richer graphical experience, and the gameplay was opened up to allow for more aggressive approaches.</p><p style="">An updated version of Snake Eater, <a href="/metal-gear-solid-3-subsistence/3030-10267/" data-ref-id="3030-10267">Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence</a>, was released on March 14, 2006, featuring a large number of side content in the style of <a href="/metal-gear-solid-vr-missions/3030-8761/" data-ref-id="3030-8761">VR Missions</a>, and, most notably, an improved fully controllable camera, a first for the series. Snake Eater was packaged with the <a href="/metal-gear-solid-hd-collection/3030-35508/" data-ref-id="3030-35508">Metal Gear Solid HD Collection</a> in 2011 for PS3 and 360; in February 2012 Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater 3D was released for the 3DS. Unfortunately, the bizarre <a href="/guy-savage/3005-24540/" data-ref-id="3005-24540">Guy Savage</a> nightmare is only playable in the original and Subsistence releases.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">Traditional to the Metal Gear Solid series, MGS3 focuses on <a href="/stealth/3015-24/" data-ref-id="3015-24">stealth</a> and <a href="/sneaking-mission/3015-3406/" data-ref-id="3015-3406">sneaking</a> around enemies rather than straight up confronting them in a gunfight, though this entry is more forgiving in that regard, and offers up a large number of guns with which to shoot folks. If the player is spotted, the guards will enter an alert mode. At ALERT: 99.99, the enemy can see Snake and is currently firing at him. Until you break line of sight for a sustained period of time the counter will not drop. At ALERT: 99.98 and below, the enemy is still searching for Snake. If the counter runs down to 0, the game enters EVASION mode. In EVASION, the enemy is still looking for Snake, but not as vigorously. If that counter runs down, the game will enter CAUTION mode. The enemy has given up searching for Snake, but is still aware of his presence. Guards who were called in as backup firepower will return to the nearest barracks, and any patrol guards killed during the firefight will be replaced.</p><p style="">Because of the 60s setting, the <a href="/radar/3015-3542/" data-ref-id="3015-3542">radar</a> in previous games has not been invented, and the player must rely on special equipment. The active sonar, activated when you press L3, sends out a rather noisy ping, and reports the location of all animals and people, but the noise the ping makes may alert the enemy. The motion detector reports the location of all moving objects, but not stationary ones. The AP sensor vibrates the controller upon detecting an enemy. Snake can also use a <a href="/mine-detector/3055-1467/" data-ref-id="3055-1467">mine detector</a> to locate <a href="/claymore/3055-1272/" data-ref-id="3055-1272">claymores</a>. These items take up battery power, which refills when not in use. If the battery runs out completely, the items that use battery power will not operate for a short period of time.</p><p style="">The game also has the <a href="/survival/3015-1297/" data-ref-id="3015-1297">survival</a> system, which was new to this game. The <a href="/stamina-bar/3015-3569/" data-ref-id="3015-3569">stamina meter</a>, below your health bar, determines how fast you run, how much your health recovers, and how well you aim. To replenish this, you can capture animals by shooting them or attacking them with your knife. You can then eat them, which replenishes the stamina in various amounts. Snake has different affinities to different foods.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8480/224000-snake6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-224000" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.75040518638574" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8480/224000-snake6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-224000"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8480/224000-snake6.jpg"></a><figcaption>Camouflage</figcaption></figure><p style="">The <a href="/camouflage/3015-149/" data-ref-id="3015-149">camouflage</a> system determines how well hidden you are in the surrounding environment. Snake has a variety of uniforms and face paints he can wear, each blending him in more or making him stick out more. If you get injured, you can use the cure screen to heal yourself. You can have various injuries like cuts and burns, and you can use medical supplies to heal Snake.</p><p style="">New to this game also is <a href="/cqccqb/3015-865/" data-ref-id="3015-865">CQC</a>. If Snake has a CQC compatible weapon, he can sneak up to an enemy and grab him by pressing the circle button and holding it, he can then transition into a number of moves. He can slit his throat by holding down the circle button firmly, interrogate him by holding down the left stick, choke him by mashing circle many times, or use him as a <a href="/human-shield/3015-176/" data-ref-id="3015-176">human shield</a> to defend against enemy fire. As was the case in MGS2, enemies will respond to being held up, and will drop items when you aim your weapon at their head or crotch. They can be knocked out, put to sleep or killed. You can shoot their radios dead so they can't call for armed backup, use noise to distract them, and aim for their limbs to limit movement or stop them from wielding firearms. The boss battles, as with all MGS games, present the player with a number of unique situations, such as a sniper battle which can last hours, a man who throws bees at you, a river of ghosts and more.</p><p style="">The camera in this game does not have a 3D rotational camera of other action games, but rather the stationary camera of past Metal Gear Solid games. The main camera is a roughly <a href="/isometric-viewpoint/3015-246/" data-ref-id="3015-246">isometric</a> camera, which can be panned, but not rotated, by the R stick. An optional, (now-traditional) 3D rotational camera with full player control was added in <a href="/metal-gear-solid-3-subsistence/3030-10267/" data-ref-id="3030-10267">Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence</a>. The other main camera is the <a href="/first-person-perspective/3015-330/" data-ref-id="3015-330">first person view</a>. Snake cannot move while in first person, but can see the world around him, and aim his weapon by pressing square. If Snake presses up against a wall, he can see the area around the corner, and can get and even better view by peeking, which is done by pressing L2 or R2. The last camera angle is infiltration mode. When lying down in tall grass of crawling through a hole, the game enters first person mode, but the player is able to move around.</p><h3><b>Camouflage</b></h3><h4><b>Face</b></h4><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1120760-k3302.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1120760" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.75689655172414" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1120760-k3302.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1120760"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1120760-k3302.jpg"></a><figcaption>Kabuki Face Camouflage</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Black: Black face paint.

At the outset, Naked Snake is sent behind enemy lines via a HA-LO jump to retrieve a <a href="/russia/3035-38/" data-ref-id="3035-38">Russian</a> weapons designer named <a href="/sokolov/3005-4168/" data-ref-id="3005-4168">Sokolov</a></p><p style="">who wishes to defect to the <a href="/the-united-states-of-america/3035-396/" data-ref-id="3035-396">United States</a>. Sokolov has developed an advanced tank named the <a href="/shagohod/3055-453/" data-ref-id="3055-453">Shagohod</a>, which is a direct precursor to the bipedal <a href="/metal-gear/3055-28/" data-ref-id="3055-28">Metal Gear</a> weapons which threaten global stability in the other series installments. Snake is aided over the radio by new characters like Major <a href="/zero/3005-476/" data-ref-id="3005-476">Zero</a>, <a href="/para-medic/3005-3812/" data-ref-id="3005-3812">Para-Medic</a>, and <a href="/the-boss/3005-478/" data-ref-id="3005-478">The Boss</a>, his former mentor. After finding Sokolov under strict protection from the Red Army, a new Russian faction is explained by Sokolov named GRU, a radical movement within Soviet government under the control of a <a href="/colonel-volgin/3005-3545/" data-ref-id="3005-3545">Colonel Volgin</a>. Snake and Sokolov are confronted by GRU soldiers as well as a young <a href="/revolver-ocelot/3005-346/" data-ref-id="3005-346">Revolver Ocelot</a>, and Snake is able to escape them. On their way back to the extraction point, however, Naked Snake and Sokolov are confronted by the Boss, her former Cobra unit, as well as Colonel Volgin. The Boss explains her defection to Russia and gives Volgin portable nuclear shells as a gift. She demands that Snake give up Sokolov, but he refuses, and he is thrown off a bridge and flows downriver.</p><p style="">When Volgin, the <a href="/cobra-unit/3015-3706/" data-ref-id="3015-3706">Cobra Unit</a>, and The Boss leave on helicopters, Volgin tests his new "gift" <a href="/nuclear-bomb/3055-231/" data-ref-id="3055-231">nukes</a> on a Soviet weapons facility. At the same time, Snake flows down river where he has sustained gruesome injuries. After he heals himself, the nuclear shell goes off in the distance, and Snake is returned to a hospital. In the hospital, Major Zero educates Snake of the United State's situation. The Soviets believed the US responsible for the nuclear shell by Volgin as an US Airforce plane was in close airspace- the one Snake <a href="/parachute/3055-504/" data-ref-id="3055-504">parachuted</a> out of. Lyndon B. Johnson received a phone call from Kruschev to inform him of the situation. Kruschev explains that he does not believe the US attacked, but he is under great pressure in <a href="/soviet-union/3035-507/" data-ref-id="3035-507">Soviet</a> government to respond. He gives Johnson two weeks for the United States to prove their innocence by taking out Volgin. Snake is ordered to return to bring back Sokolov, destroy the Shagohod, and eliminate both Volgin and The Boss.</p><p style="">After reinsertion from a jet plane, Snake returns to the hideout Sokolov was just days earlier, where a woman on a motorbike named <a href="/eva/3005-1029/" data-ref-id="3005-1029">Eva</a> confronts him. After explaining Adam couldn't make it, and a night of desperate seduction, Snake and Eva are confronted by Ocelot and GRU soldiers once again. Eva and Snake defeat the troops, and Eva has to return to base before Ocelot, or else he may become suspicious of their internal spy. One by one, Snake defeats the Cobra Unit members, including <a href="/the-pain/3005-1053/" data-ref-id="3005-1053">The Pain</a>, <a href="/the-fury/3005-2254/" data-ref-id="3005-2254">The Fury</a>,</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8480/223988-imetal_gear_solid_3_snake_eateri_20041110015920968.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-223988" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8480/223988-imetal_gear_solid_3_snake_eateri_20041110015920968.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-223988"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8480/223988-imetal_gear_solid_3_snake_eateri_20041110015920968.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8480/223988-imetal_gear_solid_3_snake_eateri_20041110015920968.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Pain</figcaption></figure><p style=""><a href="/the-end/3005-1940/" data-ref-id="3005-1940">The End</a>, and <a href="/the-fear/3005-1943/" data-ref-id="3005-1943">The Fear</a>. After infiltrating the base wearing a mask disguised as a GRU Captain <a href="/ivan-raidenovitch-raikov/3005-477/" data-ref-id="3005-477">Ivan Raikov</a> who is friends with Volgin, Snake is found a fake by Volgin, and Sokolov is killed as Shagohod had completed production. Snake is then viciously <a href="/torture/3015-2574/" data-ref-id="3015-2574">tortured</a>, where he learns of Volgin's "Philosopher's Legacy", a slush fund used by the United States, Russia, and China during <a href="/world-war-ii/3015-471/" data-ref-id="3015-471">World War II</a>, but Volgin's father stole it during the chaos of the war.</p><p style="">The Boss refuses to follow Volgin's orders to kill Snake, and he survives the torture - but not without losing an eye. He escapes with the help of Eva by jumping off a high ledge into a gorge below whilst being followed by attack dogs and Ocelot. In a death like dream, players must walk Snake through a river where ghosts of all the NPCs the player has killed haunts him. <a href="/the-sorrow/3005-1951/" data-ref-id="3005-1951">The Sorrow</a>, a former member of the Cobra Unit and Boss's lover, also haunts Snake in conjunction with helping the player receive the <a href="/codec/3015-2355/" data-ref-id="3015-2355">codec</a> code to open the prison cell doors. Snake later infiltrates the base and places C3 charges around the Shagohod. But Eva was discovered in the basement looking for the legacy by GRU, and The Boss discovers Snake's explosives. Snake then fights Volgin, where Ocelot refuses to help his comrade.</p><blockquote data-align="right"><p style="">"There is only room for one Boss... and one Snake..."</p><cite>The Boss' Last Words</cite></blockquote><p style="">Snake and Eva then try to escape, only to have the Volgin use the Shagohod against them. Finally defeating them both in an intense boss fight, Snake and Eva escape to a plane on a lake, where Snake has to confront The Boss. She gives a speech about soldiers being pawns for war. After the long, emotional battle she describes her relationship with the Sorrow, how they had a child taken away during the invasion of Normandy, as well as when the Boss herself was ordered to kill The Sorrow during the Cold War. In a scene echoing the execution of Sniper Wolf, the player must then manually press the fire button to shoot and kill the boss. Snake and Eva then escape via WiG to an Alaskan log cabin.</p><p style="">In the morning, Snake awakes to find Eva gone as well as a monogram left. In true Metal Gear fashion, the plot is all explained at the very end. Eva tells Snake she is not an agent for the Americans or for the Russians, but for the People's Republic of <a href="/china/3035-343/" data-ref-id="3035-343">China</a>. Her sole objective was to retrieve the Philosopher's Legacy from Volgin, however, she was recognized by The Boss, as the Boss helped train developing spy agents. Eva explains how the Boss wanted to relay a message to Snake. The Boss in reality was not a defector to the Soviets, but an American patriot to the end. Her job was to fake defection in order to more easily infiltrate Volgin's workings. Except, when Volgin used a nuclear shell, the Soviets needed someone to blame, and that person was The Boss. The United States used The Boss as a scapegoat to avoid nuclear confrontation, and The Boss knew all along she had to die at the hands of her apprentice. Snake is disgusted by the CIA director and President as they want him to control all <a href="/sneaking-mission/3015-3406/" data-ref-id="3015-3406">sneaking missions</a> within the CIA. After achieving the codename "Big Boss", Snake goes to the cemetery where The Boss lays with no name other than "Here Lies a True American Patriot."</p><p style="">After the end credits roll we hear a phone conversation between Ocelot and his Russian superior informing us that he was actually a double agent working to oust Khrushchev through his activities with the GRU. A subsequent phone call with the American CIA director reveals that he was actually a TRIPLE agent by the code name ADAM, the one Snake was supposed to rendezvous with at the ruined factory. He goes on to explain that he is in possession of the Philosopher's Legacy, that the Russians have a fake, and the game ends with his mention of Granin's idea to build a bipedal tank.</p><h2><b>Easter Eggs</b></h2><p style="">In the Graniny Gorld Lab in the Lab B1 East area, on the desk of the Control Room, are several real life video game magazines including <a href="/metal-gear-solid-2-sons-of-liberty/3030-12388/" data-ref-id="3030-12388">Metal Gear Solid 2</a> on the cover of one issue, <a href="/zone-of-the-enders/3030-11350/" data-ref-id="3030-11350">Zone of the Enders</a> on the cover of PSM and <a href="/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater/3030-18082/" data-ref-id="3030-18082">Metal Gear Solid 3</a> on the cover of GameInformer.</p><p style="">When Snake is thrown off the bridge the player is prompted to press the "R1" button.

Need for Speed breaks off from the norm in Need for Speed games with legal street racing edging Forza Motorsport. Competitively Pro Street is used as the World Cyber Games PC Racing game.</p><p style=""><b>Details:</b></p><ul><li>EA's 11th in series, Need For Speed: ProStreet, moves the series from illegal street racing to the track. The game focuses around a young man named <a href="/ryan-cooper/3005-8624/" data-ref-id="3005-8624">Ryan</a> who moves his way up through battles to take on the king of racing. The Street King is <a href="/ryo-watanabe/3005-15764/" data-ref-id="3005-15764">Ryo Watanabe</a>, a punk who runs his mouth about how much better he is than everyone else. Ryo drives a Mitsubishi Lancer Evo X. There are two versions of his Evo : one has a different spoiler, but that's the only real difference.<br /><b></b></li></ul><p style=""><b>Game Modes:</b></p><ul><li>Drag Racing: This mode involves racing in a straight line aiming for perfect shifts. This mode usually revolves around 1/4 mile and 1/2 mile tracks and even sometimes contains a wheelie competition.</li><li>Grip Racing: This mode involves track based courses aiming for perfection in the turns. There are even several classes within this type of racing, from normal grip, class grip, sector shootout, to time attacks. In normal grip, it is you against the rest of the field (no matter the cars specs) to be the first to complete all the laps. In class grip, you will be placed against 3 other cars with equivalent type of equipment and settings. In sector shootout, you earn points by pulling the fastest time through certain sections of the track. In time attack, it is whoever can pull the fastest lap out of the whole field.</li><li>Speed Racing: This mode involves high speed racing on long highway type of course where you must learn to use small and precise controls at such high speeds. In this mode, you will either need to be the first to cross the line or pull the overall fastest trap times in certain sections.</li><li>Drift Racing: This mode involves taking a small portion of a track and see who can pull the best drifts which involve getting your car sideways while keeping your speed up.</li></ul><h2>Plot</h2><p style="">The main protagonist of NFS: Pro Street is the wannabe "Street King", Ryan Cooper. You roll up with your Nissan 240SX on race day as you attempt to become champion for each racing event that's held. The first official race day you will encounter is Battle Machine. You move along onto different race days as you complete and become victorious on them. After winning Battle Machine you are then sponsored by Super Promotion to compete at the Showdown at Chicago Airfield. After you dominate the airfield you move along to R3act Team Sessions, you break records, earn cash, earn parts, unlock cars etc. Ryan Cooper then goes to challenge each race modes race King. You defeat each Street King and then move up to to the Showdown King himself, Ryo Watanabe. Once you defeat Ryo you are crowned the Street King of the world.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><ol><li>Airbourne - Blackjack</li><li>Avenged Sevenfold - Almost Easy</li><li>Bloc Party - Prayer</li><li>Chromeo - Fancy Footwork (Guns 'n Bombs Remix)</li><li>Clutch - Power Player</li><li>CSS - Odio Odio Odio Sorry C</li><li>Datarock - I Used to Dance With My Daddy (Karma Harvest Mix)</li><li>Digitalism - Pogo</li><li>Dude 'n Nem - Watch My Feet</li><li>DUNE - A Blast Beat</li><li>The Faint - Dropkick The Punks</li><li>Foreign Islands - We Know You Know It</li><li>The Horrors - Draw Japan</li><li>Junkie XL (Feat.

and an all new deke button that allows you to separate the puck from your player to skate around defencemen and get scoring chances.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Single Player</h2>NHL 2008 introduced new game mechanics, and fixed the major problems of NHL 2007, making one of the greatest hockey games of the NHL franchise. All the modes had endures from the previous version, Dynasty, Season, Play Now, and now Shootout. These modes are largely the same as they had been, except of course shootout, which now enabled players to play as the goalie, although its much more difficult to learn the controls. Dynasty mode enables players to play and manage their favorite team as they see fit, however trading can still be unrealistic as teams will trade away franchise players without thinking twice. The problems with goaltending from NHL 2007, has largely been rectified, but there are still various glitches in the game.<figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2032/179372-nhl08.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-179372" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2032/179372-nhl08.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-179372"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2032/179372-nhl08.jpg"></a></figure><br/><br/><h2>Multiplayer</h2>The same local multiplayer is there, but online play was largely revamped, allowing for larger games to be played, and leader boards created.<br/><br/><h2>Features</h2><ul class="plain-list"><li>Frame rate is locked at 60 frames per second, up from NHL 07's 30 frames per second.</li> <li>On the fly Artificial Intelligence that adapts to the player's play styles.</li> <li>Goalie mode for playing as the goalie for the duration of a game.</li> <li>Custom user plays for offense and defense.</li> <li>Fluid skating animations.</li> <li>In depth Create-A-Team section.</li> <li>New RBK Edge Hockey Jerseys.  The RBK Edge jerseys can be unlocked through the My NHL 08 menu under RBK Edge.  The code to unlock the jerseys are "h3oyxpwksf8ibcgt".</li> <li>American Hockey League (AHL) added.</li> </ul> <br/><h2>Cover Athletes</h2>Eric Staal (Caroline Hurricanes) is the main cover athlete<br/>Henrik Zetterberg (Detroit Red Wings) in Sweden<br/>Teemu Selanne (Anaheim Ducks) in Finland<br/>Jaromir Jagr (New York Rangers) in Czech Republic<br/>Mark Streit (Montreal Canadians) in Switzerland<br/><br/><h2>Soundtrack</h2>Airbourne - Stand Up For Rock N' Roll<figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8918/247659-121368_9_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-247659" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8918/247659-121368_9_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-247659"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/8918/247659-121368_9_2.jpg"></a><figcaption>Pulling the goalie</figcaption></figure><br/>Anberlin - A Whisper And A Clamor<br/>Bayside - The Walking Wounded<br/>Datarock - Fa-Fa-Fa<br/>Disco Ensemble - This Is My Head Exploding<br/>Dustin Kensrue - I Knew You Before<br/>Enter Shikari - Sorry, You're Not A Winner<br/>Jupiter One - Turn Up The Radio<br/>Luna Halo - Kings &amp; Queens<br/>Manchester Orchestra - Wolves At Night<br/>Mando Diao - The Wildfire (If It Was True)<br/>Paramore - Misery Business<br/>PlayRadioPlay! - Compliment Eacah Other Like Colors<br/>Pop Levi - Sugar Assault Me Now<br/>Santogold - L.E.S.

It focuses more on being over the top (giant muscles, long home runs, fast pitches) instead of being a simulator.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<p style="">The BIGS is an action style baseball game that may seem similar to Midway's Slugfest series, and indeed it is. There aren't many modes in The BIGS, there is a career mode where you take your rookie from the start of the season to the end of the season. There is a very addicting Baseball Pinball mode where you choose a power hitter from the MLB and you take him to the middle of Times Sqaure and you just hit stuff with the ball that is pitched to you. The smaller the object you hit, the bigger the points you get. The difficulty also changes as you keep rising in your score where they add different pitches like curveballs, changeups, etc. There is also an online component that is very basic. You and a friend or random oppenent just meet up and get a game going. The BIGS is an action style baseball game where there are insane pitches and all the guys in the game are juiced with steriods. A nice break from all the realistic baseball games.  Check it out for almost any system available. <br/> <br/> <br/></p><h2>Soundtrack </h2> <br/><ul class="plain-list"><li>Stone Temple Pilots - Plush</li><li>Screaming Trees - Nearly Lost You</li><li>Jane’s Addiction - Ocean Size</li><li>Killing Joke - Millennium</li><li>Rollins Band - Tearing</li><li>White Zombie - More Human than Human</li><li>Midnight Oil - Dreamworld</li><li>Fu Manchu - Hung out to Dry</li><li>Motorhead - Ace of Spades</li><li>The Stooges - Down On The Street</li><li>Primus - Jerry Was A Racecar Driver</li><li>Blue October - Somebody</li><li>Satellite Party - Insanity Rains</li><li>Highbench - Satisfied </li></ul>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>18255</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/2261139-box_thebigs.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/2261139-box_thebigs.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/2261139-box_thebigs.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/2261139-box_thebigs.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/2261139-box_thebigs.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2261139-box_thebigs.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/2261139-box_thebigs.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[The BIGS]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-14/]]></api_detail_url><id>14</id><name><![CDATA[OFLC: G]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-6/]]></api_detail_url><id>6</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: E]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2007-06-26 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-18/]]></api_detail_url><id>18</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation Portable]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-portable/3045-18/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PSP]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-19/]]></api_detail_url><id>19</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 2]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-2/3045-19/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS2]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-36/]]></api_detail_url><id>36</id><name><![CDATA[Wii]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/wii/3045-36/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[Wii]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/the-bigs/3030-18255/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[R&C]]></aliases><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-18309/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-04-01 16:39:34</date_added><date_last_updated>2014-08-21 14:28:02</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[Ratchet &amp;

Clank</figcaption></figure><p style=""><a href="/ratchet/3005-120/" data-ref-id="3005-120">Ratchet</a> is a Lombax, a kind of feline type creature while <a href="/clank/3005-323/" data-ref-id="3005-323">Clank</a> is essentially a small robot. Teamed up they make a force to be reckoned with. However where there are good guys there is always a bad guy and it comes in the form of <a href="/ultimate-supreme-executive-chairman-drek/3005-3237/" data-ref-id="3005-3237">Chairman Drek</a>. A creepy space alien who wants to take over the universe and that's what you're here to prevent.</p><p style="">This is essentially a platform game with some basic level designs for you to run around in, these levels are filled with a variety of aliens and robots for you to dispose of in a variety of weird and wonderful ways. You can attack, dodge, blast and tactically jump your way into and out of any situation with an array of crazy weapons at your disposal.</p><p style="">The combat is 100% open in this game, you can do just about anything you want within reason. Providing you don't die of course, be it a laser to the head or falling off the nearest cliff. There are limitless ways to dispose of enemies, whether you want to use your Morph-O-Ray to turn them into Chickens, or use your <a href="/ryno/3055-494/" data-ref-id="3055-494">R.Y.N.O</a> to obliterate all in your path.</p><h2>Storyline</h2><p style="">On a distant planet, a small robot manages to escape a production plant, only to be shot down while trying to get away in a small shuttle. Meanwhile, on the planet of <a href="/planet-veldin/3035-468/" data-ref-id="3035-468">Veldin</a>, <a href="/ratchet/3005-120/" data-ref-id="3005-120">Ratchet</a> is working on fixing his own ship at his garage. Suddenly, he spots something falling from the sky, landing not far from where he was working. He finds the small robot and brings it back with him, naming it ' <a href="/clank/3005-323/" data-ref-id="3005-323">Clank</a>'.</p><p style="">When Clank has recovered, he shows Ratchet a message from an Infobot. It features <a href="/ultimate-supreme-executive-chairman-drek/3005-3237/" data-ref-id="3005-3237">Chairman Drek</a>, explaining how his home planet of Blarg has become so over-polluted that it is becoming impossible to live there anymore. To solve this problem, Drek reveals his plans - taking large parts from various planets, from across the <a href="/solana-galaxy/3035-466/" data-ref-id="3035-466">Solana Galaxy</a>, then combining them into one new area for the Blarg to live. Clank suggest they try to find <a href="/captain-qwark/3005-758/" data-ref-id="3005-758">Captain Qwark</a>, the galaxy's most famous hero, to warn him of Drek's plans. Realizing his own planet is under threat, Ratchet agrees.</p><p style="">During their flight, Ratchet's faulty ship causes trouble again, and they end up crash landing at Novalis. While there, they receive a new ship from a native, and an infobot, containing an ad for Al's Roboshack, featuring Captain Qwark. They then fly on to Metropolis, to meet <a href="/big-al/3005-2937/" data-ref-id="3005-2937">Big Al</a>. Although he doesnt know where Qwark is, and hadn't seen him since they filmed the advert, he does upgrade Clank, installing a Heli-Pak.</p><p style="">Eventually, they do find Qwark, and meet up with him at his challenge course at Umbris. After they complete the course, Qwark traps them, surrounding the pair with lava. Here, he reveals his involvement with Chairman Drek, hoping it will lead to a job oppurtunity on the newly formed planet. He then leaves them to fight a Snagglebeast, expecting they would both be defeated.</p><p style="">After they escape, Ratchet becomes angry towards Clank, and even more so towards Qwark, vowing to get revenge on the hero. After travelling to many planets, they manage to track down Qwark, defeating him in a space battle. After this, Ratchet sees Drek destroying a nearby planet and realises how un-caring he had become. He then vows to co-operate with Clank to try defeat Drek.</p><p style="">They gain more information about Drek's plans to use the Deplanetizer, and discover that Ratchet's home planet of Veldin is next in line for destruction. They rush back to the planet, and confront Drek. He proceeds to tell them how it was his plan all along to pollute his home planet, knowing he could make money selling land on the new one. A large battle between him and the duo ensues in which Drek is eventually defeated. Clank notices that the Deplanetizer's position has moved and is now pointing at Blarg, Drek's home planet. Before they can do anything, the machine activates and destroys Blarg.</p><p style="">After this, the two become overnight celebrities, featured in media across the galaxy.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><p style="">Over the top weapons became a staple of the series, after the first game introduced some wild and innovative methods of destroying enemies. Unlike later games, Ratchet &amp; Clank didn't feature the ability for weapons to gain experience and upgrade themselves. Instead Gold Bolts could be 'attached' to the player's arsenal to augment the power.</p><p style="">The weapons available in the game include:</p><ul><li><b>Bomb Glove (Free) Ammo: 40 Bombs</b></li></ul><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/34951/1070583-bomb_glove.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1070583" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.73977695167286" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:74.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/34951/1070583-bomb_glove.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1070583"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/34951/1070583-bomb_glove.jpg"></a><figcaption>The Bomb Glove</figcaption></figure><p style="">The Gadgetron Bomb Glove is a staple weapon of the Ratchet and Clank games, with most other titles in the series featuring this weapon or one that is very similar.

It also made some timed underwater events possible to complete, such as the one found on planet Rilgar.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/72094/1248268-rnc_trespasser_1.png" data-ref-id="1300-1248268" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.74149659863946" data-width="147" style="width: 147px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:74.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/72094/1248268-rnc_trespasser_1.png" data-ref-id="1300-1248268"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/7/72094/1248268-rnc_trespasser_1.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/7/72094/1248268-rnc_trespasser_1.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Trespasser</figcaption></figure><ul><li><b>The Trespasser</b></li></ul><p style="">Found on planet Aridia, the Trespasser allows Ratchet to hack invinco-locks.

It was first released on the Atari Jaguar and MSDOS in 1995, then released on the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn two months later. The game marked the debut of the <a href="/rayman/3025-409/" data-ref-id="3025-409">Rayman</a> series of video games.</p><p style="">Rayman can also be found on the GameBoy Advance, under the title of Rayman Advance. It is also available on the US and UK Playstation Store and can be purchased for $5.99 and £3.99 respectively. On the week of 7th December 2009 Rayman was released for DSiWare</p><h2>Plot</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14018/417650-rayman.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-417650" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="232" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 232px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14018/417650-rayman.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-417650"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14018/417650-rayman.jpg"></a><figcaption>Rayman's world during the intro sequence</figcaption></figure><p style="">Rayman lives in a peaceful world where the magical creatures and nature coexist with one another. It's not until Mister Dark, a cloaked villain claims the Great Protoon for himself and destroys the balance and harmony in Rayman's world. The electoons that orbited the Great Protoon were scattered across the land and locked in cages. It's up to Rayman to free the electoons and reclaim the Great Protoon stolen by Mister Dark so the world can live in harmony once more.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">Rayman is a traditional 2D platformer that involves the player having to reach the end of each side-scrolling stage. Rayman has a health bar that can be increased from three hearts to six by collecting a special power up. If all of his health bar is depleted, Rayman will lose a life.</p><p style="">At the beginning of the game, Rayman can't do anything besides walk and jump, but at certain points in the game he is given new abilities by Betilla the fairy. He will eventually be able to use his fists to punch at enemies, hang onto ledges and grab onto various objects, including swinging from floating loops in the air. He can also learn to fly for a short amount of time and also run when a button is held down.</p><p style="">As Rayman explores each stage, he is able to collect small blue objects called Tings. He can offer them to the Magician, who can give Rayman access to special bonus stages. Collecting one hundred Tings will also award Rayman with an extra life.</p><p style="">The main aim of the game is to collect every single electoon in the stages throughout the game. Every stage has six electoon cages hidden, which need to be found in order to access the final stages and the final boss battle.</p><h2>Releases</h2><p style="">There are many different versions and releases of Rayman. The game's development goes as far back as the Super Nintendo. Due to a shift in technological advancement, the 16-bit platforms were becoming financially unfeasable and bieng overshadowed by newer platforms, giving way for more advanced hardware. After skipping platforms such as the Sega 32X, Rayman would finally make it's debut on a cartridge based system.</p><h3>Rayman (Jaguar)</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6763/501891-s_rayman_6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-501891" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.6765625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:67.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6763/501891-s_rayman_6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-501891"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6763/501891-s_rayman_6.jpg"></a><figcaption>Story sequences were told through stills in the Jaguar version.</figcaption></figure><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6763/501886-s_rayman_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-501886" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.6765625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:67.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6763/501886-s_rayman_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-501886"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6763/501886-s_rayman_1.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6763/501886-s_rayman_1.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Rayman's first release. Running on the Atari Jaguar.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The very first version of Rayman was released on the <a href="/jaguar/3045-28/" data-ref-id="3045-28">Atari Jaguar</a> has several differences and features not seen in any other version of the game ranging from level design, presentation and more. For example the Moskito flying stages were shoot-em-up stages where the Moskito shot a laser from it's beak to defeat enemies. While it was altered for future versions of the game, this gameplay design would later be seen in <a href="/rayman-origins/3030-31721/" data-ref-id="3030-31721">Rayman Origins</a> years later. Story elements were told through still images and artwork but still carried the same basic plot featuring Mr. Dark and the protoons. This is also one of two versions of Rayman that features a <a href="/breakout/3030-13049/" data-ref-id="3030-13049">breakout</a> clone. During development, the game also featured artwork and sprites representinglimbs for Rayman but were cut from the final version due to technical limitations and cartridge space which became an important factor in Rayman's character design.</p><h3>Rayman (Playstation 1, Sega Saturn and MS-DOS)</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1166483-rayman21.png" data-ref-id="1300-1166483" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.63291139240506" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:63.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1166483-rayman21.png" data-ref-id="1300-1166483"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/17172/1166483-rayman21.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/17172/1166483-rayman21.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>The advancement in hardware provided several benefits for Rayman, none of which involved limbs.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Due to the failure of the Jaguar platform, Ubisoft was quick to release the game for the launch of disc based systems. Because of the additional space and longer development time, the developers were able to add in higher quality sound and CD based redbook audio for the music giving way for speech, orchestrated music and even full motion video. Levels were refined and in some cases made even harder than the original version. This version would become the base for future releases of Rayman on modern consoles and handhelds. The MS-DOS version also saw various re-releases usually bundled with a level designer. The Playstation 1 version is currently available for purchase for <a href="/playstation-3/3045-35/" data-ref-id="3045-35">Playstation 3</a>, <a href="/psp/3045-18/" data-ref-id="3045-18">Portable</a> and <a href="/playstation-vita/3045-129/" data-ref-id="3045-129">Vita</a> systems through the <a href="/playstation-network-vita/3045-143/" data-ref-id="3045-143">Playstation Store</a>.</p><h4>Rayman Gold (MS-DOS)</h4><p style="">The game was released on the PC on 28 September 1997. Along with the original game, this package contained the Windows-based Rayman Designer, allowing players to design and create their own levels and then share them with others via the internet. The game also contained 24 new, original levels; these had the same gameplay, but featured some new concepts and gameplay elements including collecting differently colored Tings that allow Rayman to progress in a level by opening paths. Other features were added such as event-triggering Tings, additional objects and a level timer to see how fast the player can finish the level.</p><h4>Rayman Forever (MS-DOS)</h4><p style="">Around a year later a second PC version was released. Featuring the same content as Rayman Gold along with with 50+ new levels over the original and a fridge magnet. Various sections of the soundtrack were erased to save space on the disc.

The game was made easier to accommodate for the smaller screen by giving Rayman an extra hit-point and making certain sections easier to progress through. The game also did not reset the Ting score once a life was lost giving players better chances at obtaining extra lives. Because of the limited cartridge space, the game's graphics were compressed, music was adapted into a midi-like format and sound effects became tinny or non-existant in the port.</p><h3>Rayman (Nintendo DSi)</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14355/2302289-nmdakl0cq_uyu0_b6qumsiwz8obd61ja.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2302289" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.4948979591837" data-width="196" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 196px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:149.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14355/2302289-nmdakl0cq_uyu0_b6qumsiwz8obd61ja.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2302289"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14355/2302289-nmdakl0cq_uyu0_b6qumsiwz8obd61ja.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14355/2302289-nmdakl0cq_uyu0_b6qumsiwz8obd61ja.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The DSi version has the second screen show a map of the entire level that can scroll independently from Rayman by dragging the stylus on the touch screen.</figcaption></figure><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14355/2302286-g3um1tl4wlg4rq2d9mz5qetketn23y_q.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2302286" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.8969696969697" data-width="165" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 165px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:89.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14355/2302286-g3um1tl4wlg4rq2d9mz5qetketn23y_q.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2302286"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14355/2302286-g3um1tl4wlg4rq2d9mz5qetketn23y_q.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14355/2302286-g3um1tl4wlg4rq2d9mz5qetketn23y_q.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Nintendo.com advertisement artwork.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Making Fun and Junglevision Software developed the Nintendo DSi version for Nintendo's DSiWare digital download platform and also available in the eShop for Nintendo 3DS systems. The game was made even easier by using the same alterations as the GBA port received excluding graphical and audio compression, and Rayman is given between six to ten hit points depending on conditions and thirty continues. Some of the audio tracks taken from CD versions of the game, sound effects are low in pitch, and the game makes use of several features of the system. The inner Nintendo DSi camera will take a picture each time a checkpoint is used. The touch screen displays the entire map that can be seen by dragging the stylus in any direction and highlights key objects through the level such as Rayman's position, checkpoints and end level signposts. It also includes an achievement system that determines when a world is completed, when all the Electoons are freed and if the player has not used a continue.</p><h2>Game Boy Color Version</h2><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1169341-raymangbc002.png" data-ref-id="1300-1169341" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.9" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:90.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1169341-raymangbc002.png" data-ref-id="1300-1169341"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/17172/1169341-raymangbc002.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/17172/1169341-raymangbc002.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>The tale unfolds similarly, but certain asthetics represent Rayman 2 which came out around the same time as this version.</figcaption></figure><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1169338-raymangbc008.png" data-ref-id="1300-1169338" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.9" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:90.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1169338-raymangbc008.png" data-ref-id="1300-1169338"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/17172/1169338-raymangbc008.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/17172/1169338-raymangbc008.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Game Boy Color version features all-new levels separate from the 32-Bit Rayman.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Rayman for Game Boy Color, while similar in plot and environments, is actually a different game, however it also borrows elements from Rayman 2 as the game was released well after the original Rayman. The game follows a similar, linear progression where Rayman must free Protoons, some of which that cannot be found until Rayman has located power-ups. The only way to go back to free cages in previous levels is to complete the game which unlocks a world map.

It is known for its incredibly fluid animations, deep fighting system, and intense difficulty as players guide protagonist <a data-ref-id="3005-104" href="/ryu-hayabusa/3005-104/" slug="ryu-hayabusa">Ryu Hayabusa</a> through sixteen chapters worth of brutal combat, environmental exploration, and puzzle solving. <em>Sigma</em> represents the second re-release of <a data-ref-id="3010-1764" href="/team-ninja/3010-1764/" slug="team-ninja">Team Ninja's</a> original <a data-ref-id="3045-32" href="/xbox/3045-32/" slug="xbox">Xbox</a> game, and the first appearance of the modern franchise on a non-Microsoft system.</p><p style="">A free demo of <em>Sigma</em> is available for download through the <a data-ref-id="3045-88" href="/playstation-network-ps3/3045-88/" slug="playstation-network-ps3">PlayStation Network</a>. It includes the entire first level of the game, two higher difficulty levels which can be unlocked by defeating the end boss, and allows access to weapons which would not normally be available at that early stage of the game so players can experience some of the different fighting styles.</p><p style="">Despite receiving positive reviews from the press and public, <a data-ref-id="3040-38770" href="/tomonobu-itagaki/3040-38770/" slug="tomonobu-itagaki">Tomonobu Itagaki</a>, the director of <i>Ninja Gaiden</i> and <i>Ninja Gaiden Black</i>, dislikes the <a data-ref-id="3045-35" href="/playstation-3/3045-35/" slug="playstation-3">PlayStation 3</a> port stating that <i>"it's no good"</i>. He strongly believes that the game should always be an Xbox exclusive game and that Sigma adds nothing new to the series.</p><blockquote><div>"All you need to do is play <a data-ref-id="3030-20553" href="/ninja-gaiden-ii/3030-20553/" slug="ninja-gaiden-ii">Ninja Gaiden II</a> and then try and play Sigma afterwards and you'll see why. Despite the fact that it's on a 'next-generation' console there's no evolution whatsoever.

These foes are highly aggressive -- unlike many similar games, they will not hesitate to coordinate their attacks to strike from multiple directions at once, executing continuous combos or devastating grapple moves to exploit any opening in the player's defenses. Every enemy in the game is fast, strong, and capable of dealing out lethal amounts of damage to send the player back to the previous save point.</p><p style="">Fortunately, the player-controlled Ryu Hayabusa has a variety of upgradeable weapons at his disposal, superhuman agility which allows him roll safely away from enemy attacks and run several steps straight up most vertical surfaces, and the ability to cast a few different "ninpo" spells which can inflict heavy damage on one or more nearby foes. Fallen enemies also give off yellow essence which can be exchanged at shops for healing items, blue essence to heal up Ryu's wounds, and red essence to recharge his ninpo, and in the thick of battle, nearby essence can be absorbed to unleash immensely powerful "Ultimate Techniques" capable of slaying multiple enemies at a time.</p><p style="">Combat can take place at virtually any point in the game, but between battles, players explore each level to find hidden items and solve puzzles to proceed to the next area. There are many variations on the theme of finding a key to pass through a particular locked door, as well as environmental puzzles where Ryu must use his wall-running ability or ledge-shimmying skills to avoid damage and gain access to a hard-to-reach place. In addition to free hidden healing items, most levels also include Golden Scarab jewels which can be exchanged at shops for unique items which cannot be obtained any other way.</p><p style="">Weapons in the game include the Dragon Sword, a single katana considered the most balanced weapon in the game, nunchucks which sacrifice range for a greater attack speed, a quarterstaff which can easily hit multiple surrounding enemies with every swing, and a couple super-heavy weapons like the Dabilahro great sword which are ideal for dishing out heavy damage against some of the slower, more heavily armored opponents. Each weapon can be improved at shops in the game to unlock new and more powerful combos.</p><h2>Story &amp; Setting</h2><p style="">While visiting <a data-ref-id="3005-3907" href="/murai/3005-3907/" slug="murai">Murai</a>, the leader of another ninja clan, Ryu receives word from <a data-ref-id="3005-491" href="/ayane/3005-491/" slug="ayane">Ayane</a> that his family's village has been brutally attacked. He battles his way to the village shrine, but when his desperate attempt fails to stop the fiend <a data-ref-id="3005-3625" href="/doku/3005-3625/" slug="doku">Doku</a> from stealing the cursed Dark Dragon Blade, Ryu sets out on a mission of vengeance against the demonic forces of Vigoor who plan to use the blade to amass unstoppable power and wreak havoc throughout the world.</p><p style="">In his journey, Ryu meets <a data-ref-id="3005-2022" href="/rachel/3005-2022/" slug="rachel">Rachel</a>, a voluptuous buxom fiend hunter who is on a mission to hunt down all fiends, in particularly Doku, and to rescue her twin sister <a data-ref-id="3005-3901" href="/alma/3005-3901/" slug="alma">Alma</a>, who unfortunately is under the influence of the Greater Fiends. The two allies meet up occasionally but never fight alongside with each other.</p><p style="">Some of the locales in the game include a traditional Japanese village, a futuristic airship, a modern military base, and ancient catacombs stretching deep beneath the evil Vigoor capital, evoking an anachronistic world similar to developer Team Ninja's <a data-ref-id="3025-135" href="/dead-or-alive/3025-135/" slug="dead-or-alive">Dead or Alive</a> fighting game franchise. Enemy types vary in each level, and most chapters end with a particularly challenging boss encounter appropriate to the setting.</p><h2>Improvements &amp; Changes</h2><p style=""><em>Ninja Gaiden Sigma</em> includes all the content from the original Xbox version of <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> as well as the additional features and unlockable Mission Mode introduced in the free "Hurricane Packs" on that system.

These are in the form of three different survival modes. Weapons Master, Speed Master, and Rachel Master.</p><p style=""><b>Weapons Master</b></p><p style="">In Weapons Master you take control of <a data-ref-id="3005-104" href="/ryu-hayabusa/3005-104/" slug="ryu-hayabusa">Ryu Hayabusa</a> and have to fight your way through waves and waves of foes. But in this mode each stage has a specified weapon you have to use and no other. During the battle bosses will also show up to give you a hard time. Since this mode goes until you die, if you manage to live long enough, the waves and bosses will start to repeat and it eventually comes down to your skill to determine how long you cans survive. Your best scores will go up on an online learderboard.</p><p style=""><b>Speed Master</b></p><p style="">In Speed Master you are once again in the shoes of <a data-ref-id="3005-104" href="/ryu-hayabusa/3005-104/" slug="ryu-hayabusa">Ryu Hayabusa</a>. But unlike Weapons Master this mode is about defeating enemies as fast as you can rather than how many. Also you have all of your weapons and Ninpo to choose from. This mode has five different stages and your best times on each will be posted in an online leaderboard.</p><p style=""><b>Rachel Master</b></p><p style="">In Rachel Master you are now controller the fiend hunter <a data-ref-id="3005-2022" href="/rachel/3005-2022/" slug="rachel">Rachel</a>. This mode plays exactly like Weapons Master in that you have to kill as many enemies as you can before you die. But since Rachel only has one weapon each stage is just another venue to fight in with different monsters. This mode has five different stages. In this mode your score will also go on a online leaderboard.</p><h2>Weapons, Ninpo, &amp; Armlets</h2><p style=""><strong>Melee Weapons:</strong></p><ul><li><a data-ref-id="3055-447" href="/dragon-sword/3055-447/" slug="dragon-sword">Dragon Sword / True Dragon Sword</a></li><li>Lunar</li><li><a data-ref-id="3055-707" href="/nunchaku/3055-707/" slug="nunchaku">Nunchaku</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3055-761" href="/vigoorian-flail/3055-761/" slug="vigoorian-flail">Vigoorian Flail</a></li><li>War Hammer</li><li>Dabilahro</li><li>Wooden Sword / Unlabored Flawlessness</li><li>Kitetsu</li><li>Plasma Saber / Plasma Saber Mk II</li></ul><p style=""><strong>Projectile Weapons:</strong></p><ul><li>Spear Gun</li><li><a data-ref-id="3055-51" href="/shuriken/3055-51/" slug="shuriken">Shuriken</a></li><li>Incendiary Shurikens</li><li><a data-ref-id="3055-802" href="/windmill-shuriken/3055-802/" slug="windmill-shuriken">Windmill Shuriken</a></li><li>Smoke Bombs</li><li><a data-ref-id="3055-73" href="/bow-and-arrow/3055-73/" slug="bow-and-arrow">Bow</a> / Strong Bow</li><li>APFSDS Cores</li><li>Explosive Arrows</li></ul><p style=""><strong>Ninpo:</strong></p><ul><li>Art of the Fire Wheels - Ryu is surrounded by fireballs, causing fire damage to enemies that come into contact with him.</li><li>Art of the Inferno - Ryu charges a fireball projectile.

It was a multi-platform release, and debuted on the Xbox 360, Playstation 3, and PC on February 27, 2008 to mostly average-to-low scores.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/102837-Set%20Up_3_Test_06_New%20Head_Out%20Door_3_new%20copy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-102837" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/102837-Set%20Up_3_Test_06_New%20Head_Out%20Door_3_new%20copy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-102837"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_small/102837-Set%20Up_3_Test_06_New%20Head_Out%20Door_3_new%20copy.jpg"></a><figcaption>Elliott Maslow - The man who was always out of frame on the show.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Lost: Via Domus puts the player in the role of <a data-ref-id="3005-4473" href="/elliott-maslow/3005-4473/" slug="elliott-maslow">Elliott Maslow</a>, a survivor of the crash of Flight 815. He is a photojournalist who wakes up on the shore of a mysterious island after the crash with amnesia, and the entirety of the game is hinged upon recovering his memory through a number of "flashbacks".</p><p style="">Also typical of the show, each of the game's sections, or Episodes as they are called in the game, end with a cliffhanger. The game end in cliffhanger fashion and it has never been attempted by the show or the producers of the show to explain the mystery that is Elliot Maslow. This particular survivor, however, cannot be considered part of the canon of <em>Lost</em>, and was created solely for the purposes of this game.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">The player controls Elliott from a third-person perspective, and is allowed to interact with most of the cast of <em>Lost</em>.</p><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/102841-elliott_kate_beach.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-102841" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/102841-elliott_kate_beach.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-102841"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_small/102841-elliott_kate_beach.jpg"></a><figcaption>The player can interact with most of the Lost characters</figcaption></figure><p style="">Fans of the series will likely find their favorite characters' likeness in the game, though the number of actors/actresses who actually voiced their own virtual counterparts is limited. The player is allowed to explore and talk with them, or even trade items and goods for things more useful to the player. The core of the game, however, is centered on adventure and exploration. The game is by no means open-ended, but the player will find a variety of locations that also appear in the television show, accurately recreated. Places such as the initial site of the crash, the "dark territory," the Hatch, and many of the Dharma stations all make an appearance. A few extras that haven't been seen before are also thrown in for good measure (though some do not belong in the canon).</p><p style="">The main gameplay features include traversing the jungle and evading the smoke monster, navigating through pitch-black caves, and solving puzzles that come in the form of arranging fuses to transfer power to items that helps the player progress, such as opening doors. Lost: Via Domus also uses "episodes" to advance the plot, rather than just moving on to the next level. At each new episode, you are given a recap of the previous section. This is done to simulate watching the actual television series.</p><p style="">The Game also features "Flashback" Levels in which you must take photos of a certain objects to help Elliot regain his memories, or collect clues often in the form of a written document. Once the "Flashback" is completed, a scene will follow that furthers the plot.</p><h2>Character Voices</h2><p style="">While featuring more than 15 characters from the television series, most of the voices are not provided by the original actors. Only <a data-ref-id="3040-90191" href="/michael-emerson/3040-90191/" slug="michael-emerson">Michael Emerson</a> (Ben Linus), <a data-ref-id="3040-90192" href="/yunjin-kim/3040-90192/" slug="yunjin-kim">Yunjin Kim</a> (Sun-Hwa Kwon), Henry Ian Cusick (Desmond Hume), <a data-ref-id="3040-97619" href="/emilie-de-ravin/3040-97619/" slug="emilie-de-ravin">Emilie de Ravin</a> (Claire Littleton), M.C. Gainey (Tom) and Andrew Divoff (Mikhail Bakunin) lent their voices to their characters. The rest of the cast was filled out by stand-ins with a particular trade in being Locke - whose mostly unremarkable voice is filled in by someone with an American southern accent.</p><p style=""><b>Plot<br/>Episode One: Force Majeure</b> (Major in French)</p><p style="">This episode take place between Pilot Part 1 and Pilot Part 2</p><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/63109/1340782-942291_20080229_790screen001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1340782" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5620253164557" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/63109/1340782-942291_20080229_790screen001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1340782"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/63109/1340782-942291_20080229_790screen001.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/63109/1340782-942291_20080229_790screen001.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">As Elliot Maslow is enjoying his drink on Oceanic 815, a man approaches him. This man apparently knows Elliot, but before anything is resolved the plane rips in half, oxygen masks are down, and the Pilot of the show is relived. Elliot blacks out and mysterously finds himself unharmed and unable to remember anything. As he wanders about the Jungle he sees aperations of a woman, but Elliot is never able to confront her. Eventually he finds Kate, who triggers the game's first flashback. In this flashback Elliot, waiting on the Flight 815 plane, is taking pictures of Kate. The player's job is to focus the camera on Kate's handcuffs, which when successfully done reveals that Kate is a fugitive being watched by a Federal Marshall.

That quest is to stop the fuel leak on the Airplane, which introduces the puzzle system. With a handful of fuses, Elliot must not only connect the fuses to the right spot but also connect them with the proper voltage. More fuses and more lines on a fuse (So a single fuse take up less electricuty than a a four way fuse) take up more voltage. Upon solving and reporting the fixed leak, Jack diagnoses Elliot lack of Memory as amnesia. He recomends that Elliot finds some of his old belonging to reignite his memory.</p><p style="">Kate is one to talk to.

Jack immediately blockades the entrance to the Jungle, fearing that the survivors might wander into the jungle and be attacked by the "Monster".

Upon approaching her a flashback is triggered where Elliot, relaxing on a beachside porch, is watching this same woman dance around quite happily on the sand. They seem to be in a relationship. Once Elliot takes a picture of her, and gathers several notes about a "Hanso", a scene is triggered where Elliot and "this special someone" steal a boat to explore a nearby island. On the actual Island, Elliot decides to lie to Jack to get past him. He tells Jack that Claire has fainted, and once the ruse works Elliot is back in the jungle. He survives both a "Other" marksman, a dark cave, and a chase with the smoke Monster in his Journey to find both his laptop and camera; however he is ambushed by Ben, Tom, and Juliet at the end of the episode. His laptop is damaged severely.</p><h3>Episode Three: Via Domus</h3><p style="">(The "Way Home" in Latin, and the game's name)</p><p style="">This episode takes place between: The timeline is unknown, but Elliot sees a fully excavated hatch which is first seen in that state in the episode "Deus Ex Machina".</p><p style="">The survivor's have begun to distrust Elliot due to the recent events with Ethan Rom (A other that infiltrated the Lost camp) and they do not think Elliot was on the plane.

This triggers a flashback back in Sydney, where he is spying on Lisa Gellhorn who is the woman that Elliot keeps seeing on the island. She is trying to get information from the shop owner but more important to the current situation is Locke, who is seen in a wheelchair, trying to sell camp equipment. When Elliot confronts him about his handicapped state back on the Island, Locke tells him he will help if and only if he passes through the cave. During the journey to cave, Elliot sees a fully excavated hatch, and upon giving some criptic advice and more journeying Locke reachs the Cave. If Elliot can pass through this cave unharmed by both "The Others" and the" Smoke Monster".</p><p style="">The "Smoke Monster" briefly attacks Elliot, Lisa makes cryptic appearances, and Elliot finds a skeleton at the end. In the skeleton's hand is a compass with the words "Via Domus" enscribed upon it. Lost takes this as a sign that "The Island provides" and gives Elliot the batteries.</p><h3>Episode 4: Forty-Two</h3><p style="">This episode takes place between Exodus Part II and sometime before the Tailies arrive in "The Other 48 Days"</p><p style="">As Elliot examines his compass on the beachside he hears an explosion from the jungle. His compass points in that direction. Hurley confirms that the hatch has been happened. Then an unexplained amount of time passes as the survivors are now pressing the button regularly and Sayid is spending most of his time in the Hatch. Sayid will fix the laptop if he can prove he was on the plane. Talking to Hurley will trigger a flashback of Rico's pawnshop (the previous flashback scene) where Elliot blackmails Rico with pictures of him cheating on his wife. Rico knows that an important deal went down in room 42 of the Persephone Hotel, between Zoran Savo and other influential businessmen. Lisa bursts in claiming the story was hers, though Elliot is defensive of his motives. In this flashback Elliot Maslow learns a very important thing - his name. Upon telling Sayid - and Sayid checking for Elliot's name on the flight manifest - Sayid lets him into the Hatch.</p><p style="">Elliot explores the hatch while Sayid fixes his laptop. While in there he can do a number of things: enter 4 8 15 16 23 42 to reset the computer, follow his compass to a barricaded, concrete filled doorway, and tinker with the electrical panels that puts the station in lockdown. Elliot has 4 minutes to enter "Via Domus" into the computer and unlock the blast doors. This brief tension is ultimately irrelevant to the plot of the game, for as soon as he unlocks the door Jack and Sayid burst in. They fixed his laptop and they found information on Sarin gas and explosives. Until answers are found the plan on keeping Elliot locked in the armory.</p><h3>Episode V: Hotel Persephone</h3><p style="">Unknown: but Elliot's captivity mirrors that of Ben's in "One of Them"'</p><p style="">Elliot wakes up in the Armory and has visions of Lisa. The lights turn on, Lisa disappears, and Elliot attempts to talk to Kate through the armory door. She trusts him due to the fact that Elliot kept her fugitive secrect safe, though the one question that matters is "Let me out". This prompts a flashback of the Persephone Hotel Lobby, where Savo's deal is going down in room 42. Lisa decides to help Elliot once he tells her that Savo killed her sister, though this may be a lie. The man who had previously assaulted Elliot is guarding the room, and with Lisa's help, they distract him and Elliot sneaks into room.</p><p style="">With this information Elliot convinces Kate to release him and soon Elliot is prancing around the jungle. Using a previously found map he finds a building by the hatch, but no matter of gunfire will open the locked door. Elliot needs something stronger. The survivors back at the beach are wary of his presence but will not attempt to apprehend him. Hurley tells him there is dynamite at the Black Rock, and upon finding and using this dynamite Elliot is able to open the doorway. There he discovers the incident room. A large malfunctioning reactor is drawing his compass in, though that stops when he deactivates the reactor on a nearby terminal. With a functioning compass he is able to "Follow his way home", before he leaves the terminal beeps. A message appears, "Elliot Maslow. We know what you did. We will kill you". This message is presumably from the others.</p><h3>Episode VI: Whatever it Takes</h3><p style="">Also unknown.</p><p style="">Elliot, with little left to follow, uses his compass as his guide. It leads him to sonic fence that surrounds the barracks, otherwise known as "Otherville", and here is where the smoke monster ambushes him. The Smoke monster had previously been attacked him on his journey here, yet when it finally has him Smokie decides to let Elliot live. The reason is unknown. Juliet approaches the fence and tells Elliot that he is the one responsible for Lisa's death. This triggers a flashback where Lisa and Elliot have one more guard to distract - the man who had attacked Elliot on the island. Lisa's attempts to distract him does not work, but Elliot attempts do. He tells a guard that Elliot is a journalist, and she is soon apprehended. This saves Elliot from being apprehended.</p><p style="">Back on the Island Julliet tells Elliot that he can come through. Ben wants him for an unknown reason. She leads him to an underground station that leads to the Flame Station. There he finds Mikhael at gunpoint. The man who has the gun is the same man who attacked Elliot on the beach. Elliot saves Mikhael by killing this man. "Thank-you, but I am sorry," Mikhael tells Elliot as he gets hit by a dart.</p><h3>Episode VII: Worth a Thousand Words</h3><p style="">This episode takes place near the end of "Live Together, Die Alone"</p><p style="">This episode starts much like many of the others, a cryptic vision of Lisa. The only thing that has changed since Persephone is that Elliot is now locked up in the Hydra Station instead of the Swan Station.

Thomas Mittlewerk, the president of the Hanso Foundation, gives Savo a briefcase full of Sarin. This is a deadly nerve gas. Elliot s watching from a concealed location as Lisa come's in, two guards in her hands. Back on the Island Elliot realizes something - he killed Lisa. Thomas extorts him to Ben who has a proposition for him; Elliot will be allowed to leave if he exhorts Jack to the Black Rock (the 18th century ship where Elliot found the dynamite).</p><p style="">Elliot returns to the beach, promising a way home to Jack. Jack follows him to the captain chamber's in the Black Rock where the Others reveal they have Kate hostage and at gunpoint. Jack realizes what has happened when Tom hands Elliot his compass, saying that he may go home now. A flashback stalls the action for a moment, showing Elliot the final scene in the Persephone. Savo is interrogating Lisa to the whereabouts of Elliot, though she does not give in, and ultimately dies. Elliot takes a picture of Savo shooting Lisa, from his hiding spot, and back on the island he realizes that he let Lisa die to take a picture of Lisa dying. The ultimate story. Virtue strikes in Elliot as he decides to free Jack and Kate by shooting an explosive case of dynamite, knocking out the Others (and unfortunately Elliot). Elliot is left unconscious because Jack does not want to save someone he considers a liar. Juliet however, find him and tell him that the rest of the Other's plan on killing him. He needs to follow the compass bearing to a boat, where he can then follow the bearing of 325.</p><p style="">The final action scene is Elliot running through the jungle, dodging gunfire from Others, until he reaches the docks. At the docks Locke is there - for an unknown reason - and begins to fight off the Others for him as Elliot leaves the island. As he sailing forth the sky begins to shake and a purple/white hue takes over everything. A loud noise encompasses everything as well, mimicking the day the Swan Station imploded, and one thing Elliot can make out is a new plane coming towards the island - about to crash. Elliot then wakes up to find himself on the beach, having just crashed on a different plane. Lisa, very much alive, is standing over him. "Oh my god, we made it!" She yells and so ends the game.</p><p style=""><strong>Homages to the Show</strong>The first episode of the game is rife with homages to show. Elliot wakes up on the Island, the camera is focused on his pupil ( Perhaps the most common shot in the show)</p><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/63109/1335606-lostvd003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1335606" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.66551724137931" data-width="290" style="width: 290px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:66.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/63109/1335606-lostvd003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1335606"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/63109/1335606-lostvd003.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/63109/1335606-lostvd003.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">and he resting in the middle of a bamboo forest with a glass of Alcohol in his hand (Identical to the opening scene in the pilot). Along the way to the beach he finds Vincent and a woman's shoe, both from the Pilot, along with a dead body hanging from the vines (From season two "The Other 48 Days"). He sees apparitions of Lisa, specifically on the Beach, which is identical to Jack seeing his Father in "White Rabbit". One may argue that his ambush at the end of Episode Two, and the sabotage of the Laptop, is similar to Sayid's ambush by Locke which happened near the same time. Also, Elliot is locked up in the armory much like Ben Linus was (Though not beaten to a pulp).</p><h2>Xbox 360 Game Installation</h2><p style="">Lost: Via Domus requires 4.2GB of space to install on an Xbox 360 HDD.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>18566</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/0/5569/192105-lostviadomuscover.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5569/192105-lostviadomuscover.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/0/5569/192105-lostviadomuscover.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5569/192105-lostviadomuscover.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/5569/192105-lostviadomuscover.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5569/192105-lostviadomuscover.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/0/5569/192105-lostviadomuscover.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Lost: Via Domus]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>16</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-31/]]></api_detail_url><id>31</id><name><![CDATA[OFLC: M]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-2/]]></api_detail_url><id>2</id><name><![CDATA[PEGI: 16+]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2008-02-26 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/lost-via-domus/3030-18566/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-18569/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-04-01 16:41:21</date_added><date_last_updated>2015-07-20 21:06:42</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[BlackSite: Area 51 is a Sci-fi themed First-Person Shooter by Midway.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7167/264644-17955_normal.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-264644" data-size="small" style="width: 740px" data-ratio="0.56216216216216" data-width="740" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7167/264644-17955_normal.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-264644"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/7167/264644-17955_normal.jpg"></a><figcaption>Alien Life Form</figcaption></figure>Blacksite: Area 51 ('BlackSite' in Europe) is a Sci-fi inspired First Person Shooter where players assume the role of Delta Force soldier fighting to contain both an alien menace and a government experiment gone horribly wrong. <u><br /><br /></u> A demo was released of the game on Xbox Live on May 11 2007, and is set near the beginning of the game in Rachel, Nevada.

Once the squad get further into the area, they realize something is very wrong, and are attacked by what appear to be mutated human soldiers. Underground, Echo Squad discover some sort of alien structure, and when Logan Somers touches it, they are attacked by hordes of alien creatures. While escaping, Dr. Weis seals Somers inside the facility and the squad leave him for dead.<br /><br />Three years later, Pierce is in Nevada to help the army get back a military base which has been taken over. Echo Squad is chosen because the aliens witnessed in Iraq have been spotted around the base. While trying to infiltrate the base, they are attacked by both the aliens (Xenos) and the Reborn, heavily mutated human soldiers who have U.S. dog tags. Upon reaching Rachel, the closest town to the base, the squad are surprised to meet Logan Somers, who they thought was dead. He claims that the US government has been "experimenting" on soldiers who were thought dead or had no close family.<br /><br />Upon returning to the military base, Somers shoots Grayson and reveals he is the leader of the Reborn insurrection, and he accuses Dr. Weis of being responsible for working on the Reborn program. It is revealed that the Reborn program was scrapped when subjects proved too difficult to control. As a result, the government sealed up Area 51 and left the subjects to die. Somers wants to use the alien artifact that Echo Squad first witnessed to overthrow the government.<br /><br />Echo Squad help with the military's huge preemptive strike on Area 51 to stop Somers and the Reborn. Pierce is captured and taken to Somers, who reveals that he has activated the artifact and released Xeno-spores into the atmosphere spreading the Xenos across the country. Weis arrives and frees Pierce, who kills Somers in a shootout. Afterwards, both Wies and Pierce escape in a helicopter as Area 51 collapses, and plan to investigate how far the spores have spread.<br /><h2>Multiplayer</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6461/397532-blacksite_area_51_53079.433064.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-397532" data-size="small" style="width: 600px" data-ratio="0.56166666666667" data-width="600" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6461/397532-blacksite_area_51_53079.433064.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-397532"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/6461/397532-blacksite_area_51_53079.433064.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/6461/397532-blacksite_area_51_53079.433064.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Fire in the hole!</figcaption></figure>BlackSite: Area 51 features both ranked and player matches with the following mulitplayer modes:<br /><br /><b>Deathmatch</b> <br />Standard "every man for himself" with up to 10 players.

Emulated versions appear on Midways Arcade Treasures 2 (PS2/Xbox/GC), Midway Arcade Treasures Extended Play (PSP), and Midway Arcade Origins (360/PS3).]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">Gameplay consists of a never-ending series of maze-like dungeons, randomly drawn from a large pool of pre-set designs. Each dungeon has doors on either side that warp around to the other side (similar to <a href="/pac-man/3030-7624/" data-ref-id="3030-7624">Pac-Man</a>) You play as characters called Worriors, and have to clear each dungeon of monsters.</p><p style="">This game has single-player or simultaneous two-player co-op gameplay. Player One takes the yellow worrior (right-hand side), and Player Two takes the blue worrior (left-hand side). In the arcade version's single-player mode the blue worrior is controlled by the CPU. Contemporary home conversions usually omitted this.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14811/368573-wizard_of_wor.png" data-ref-id="1300-368573" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.65625" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:65.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14811/368573-wizard_of_wor.png" data-ref-id="1300-368573"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14811/368573-wizard_of_wor.png"></a><figcaption>Wizard of Wor Screen</figcaption></figure><p style=""><b>The enemies consist of:</b></p><ul><li>Burwor (Blue)</li><li>Garwor (Yellow)</li><li>Thorwor (Red)</li><li>Worluk</li><li>Wizard of Wor</li></ul><p style="">If a player or monster uses one of the doors on the right or left the door closes, temporarily sealing the tunnel. On the Atari 2600 version, the tunnel simply opens and closes periodically.</p><p style="">Like Asteroids, the game's enemies move to an audible tempo that increases over time; the longer players take to clear a dungeon the faster the enemies will move.</p><p style="">There are 3 types of Worling - Burwor, Garwor, and Thorwor - in ascending order of speed and viciousness. All Worlings can shoot at the players. Garwor and Thorwor can turn invisible, only becoming visible again when they enter the same corridor as a player. All monsters, including invisible ones, are displayed as blips on the radar display at the bottom of the screen. Players must use this radar to keep track of invisible Worlings.</p><p style="">Once a dungeon is cleared of all monsters, from the second dungeon on, there is a random chance that the winged Worluk - the Wizard's familiar - may appear. Worluk appears at a random position in the maze, and makes for an exit tunnel. If the players manage to bullseye Worluk before it escapes, the next level is a "Double Score Dungeon" granting a 2x score-multiplier for that level.</p><p style="">If the players manage to kill Worluk, there is a random chance that the angry Wizard of Wor will then appear. The Wizard teleports around the maze randomly, casting deadly lighting bolts, until either the Wizard or a player is killed.</p><p style="">On the Bally Astrocade, this game was released as "The Incredible Wizard." The port there makes some graphical cuts and eliminates the CPU-controlled player, but the sound is astoundingly similar to the arcade release.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>18684</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/9/93770/2366245-a5200_wizardofwor.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93770/2366245-a5200_wizardofwor.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/9/93770/2366245-a5200_wizardofwor.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/9/93770/2366245-a5200_wizardofwor.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/9/93770/2366245-a5200_wizardofwor.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2366245-a5200_wizardofwor.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/9/93770/2366245-a5200_wizardofwor.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Wizard

Each side has five classes to choose from, ranging from scouts equipped with sniping weapons to anti-armor-bearing demolitions soldiers, to heavy-artillery spotters. Each side has roughly equivalent classes with small differences that make for minor-but-interesting changes in play style. The majority of matches alternate between defense and assault gametypes for each team, but a number of stages focus entirely on one mode of play for each team. The maps in the game represent specific battles that ultimately determine the outcome of the war.<br/> <h2>Gameplay</h2>  The gameplay in Quake Wars is very much derived from that of its predecessor (although with numerous significant additions such as vehicles and player-built defences among others), meaning during any given map a team must complete a succession of objectives in order to win. A single map usually contains around 3 or more main objectives, these objectives can be any of the following:  Construction (preformed by the Engineer/Constructor class)   Demolition (preformed by the Soldier/Aggressor class)   Capture the Data-Brain (preformed by any class, can be compared to a variation of the classic CTF mode)   Hacking (preformed by the Covert Ops/Infiltrator class)   There can also be sub-missions within the map, these usually consist of either blowing open alternate routes or constructing guard towers.   <br/> <h2>Gamemodes</h2>  There is always one team on offence and one on defence and depending on the gamemode, there are three different types of play in Quake Wars, those are:     <h3>Campaign</h3> Three maps in a row where your experience points are carried over until the final map is played.<br/><br/> <h3>Objective</h3>A single round on one map.<br/><br/> <h3>Stopwatch</h3>Single map, the first team attempts to complete the map and set a time, the offence and defence then switch places and the previously defending team have to beat the set time. This is the primary mode for competitive play.<br/> <h2>Classes &amp; Loadouts<br/></h2> <h3> <u><b>GDF</b><br/></u></h3><b> </b><b><i> Soldier</i></b> <b><br/></b> Main Weapon: Assault Rifle/Rocket Launcher/GPMG/Shotgun<br/> Sec Weapon: Machine Pistol<br/>Grenades: Frag Grenades<br/>Tool(s): Arming Tool<br/>Item(s): HE Charge<br/><br/> <b>Class Description:</b><br/>The Soldier is the class fit for a person that wants to be at the frontline. You'll get more health than other classes and you'll have access to the unwieldy but reliable GPMG (heavy machinegun) and the anti-everything Rocket Launcher. Your main task will be to assault and destroy objectives of the Demolition type, once you have an area held down you'll need to plant and arm a HE Charge and defend it until the timer reaches zero. A Soldier should not be seen as an unstoppable force however and you'll need the full support of your team in order to stay on your feet.<br/> <br/> <u><b><i> Medic</i></b></u><br/>Main Weapon: Assault Rifle/Shotgun<br/>Sec Weapon: Pistol<br/>Grenades: Frag Grenades<br/>Tool(s): Defibrillators<br/>Item(s): MedPack, Supply Crate Beacon<br/><br/> <b>Class Description:</b><br/>As a Medic your objective should be to keep both you and your team alive in order to complete the given objective. Don't be discouraged by the fact that the Medic won't be able to complete most of the Main Objectives found in the game, without the support of Medics to keep the team at full health and revive fallen comrades any attempts to win the map would be near futile. A Medic also has the ability to call in a Supply Crate that'll automatically distribute Ammo Packs, MedPacks and Grenades. Also, keep in mind that for each Medic your team will get the benefit of 5 additional HP (to a maximum of 20 HP). You'll also be the one responsible for locating and destroying enemy Spawn Hosts (see: Technician) with your Defibrillators.<i> </i><i><br/></i><b> </b><b><br/></b> <u><b><i> Engineer</i></b></u><br/>Main Weapon: Assault Rifle/Grenade Launcher (unlock)/Shotgun<br/>Sec Weapon: Pistol<br/>Grenades: Frag Grenades<br/>Tool(s): Pliers, Deploy Tool<br/>Item(s): Mine<br/><br/><b>Class Description:</b><br/>The role of an Engineer can fluctuate heavily from map to map and even from objective to objective, in one situation you might be needed to stay behind the frontline and set up defences such as Mines and Turrets and in the next you could be fighting your way through hordes of Stroggs in order to get to - and complete - an objective with your repair skills. The Engineer is also the class best suited for driving vehicles through the field since only they have the ability to repair them should they get damaged. The engineer is also the best class for getting exp by parking the MCP by a anti-vehicle turret and constantly repairing it.<br/><br/><b> </b><b><i> Field Ops</i></b> <b><br/></b>Main Weapon: Assault Rifle/Scoped Assault Rifle (unlock)<br/>Sec Weapon: Pistol<br/>Grenades: Frag Grenades<br/>Tool(s): Deploy Tool, Targeting Tool<br/>Item(s): Ammo Pack, Air Strike Marker<br/><br/><b>Class Description:</b><br/>As a Field Ops your role will be to set up artillery and rain death on your enemies. You'll have acces to four different types of support (though you'll have to choose one of three different peices to go along with your Air Strike) with different strengths and uses. A Field Ops is often found on high ground where he can get a good look over the enemy emplacements in order to target them with his marker and once he unlocks the Scoped Assault Rifle he'll be a formidable fighting force even from long range. He is also crucial for indoor scenarios given that he is the only class able to supply his team with ammo indoors, in these cases he'll have to try and find a balance between keeping his artillery active and falling back to re-supply his team.<br/><br/> <u><b><i> Covert Ops</i></b></u><br/>Main Weapon: Scoped Assault Rifle/Sniper Rifle<br/>Sec Weapon: Silenced Pistol (upgrades to Silenced Machine Pistol)<br/>Grenades: EMP Grenades<br/>Tool(s): Hacking Tool, Deploy Tool<br/>Item(s): Third Eye Camera, Smoke Grenade<br/><br/><b>Class Description:</b><br/>A Covert Ops is an extremely versatile class, you'll have a tool or ability for almost any given situation. You might find yourself on a hill utilizing the powerful and accurate Sniper Rifle or you could disguise yourself as an enemy and hide in their ranks, waiting for the right moment to strike with your mighty Backstab. As a Covert Ops you'll also be a formidable force against enemy vehicles since your EMP Grenades are able to disable any vehicle for a duration of 40 seconds, you'll also have your remote triggered Third Eye explosive camera handy to deal massive damage to anything caught in its blast.<br/><br/> <h3><i> </i><i><b>Strogg</b></i></h3><b> </b><b><i> Aggressor</i></b> <b><br/></b>Main Weapon: Lacerator/Obliterator/Hyperblaster/NailGun<br/>Sec Weapon: Lightning Pistol<br/>Grenades: Sharp Grenades<br/>Tool(s): Arming Tool<br/>Item(s): Plasma Charge<br/><b><br/>Class Description:</b><br/>The Aggressor is the Strogg version of the Soldier, they are the ones with access to heavy weapons and high explosives.<br/><br/> <u><b><i>Technician</i></b></u><br/>Main Weapon: Lacerator/NailGun<br/>Sec Weapon: Blaster<br/>Grenades: Sharp Grenades<br/>Tool(s): Stroyent Tool<br/>Item(s): Stroyent Cells<br/><br/><b>Class Description:</b><br/>The Technician is much like the GDF Medic in that he's the one responsible for keeping health up and reviving his team-mates. There are a few major differences though. The Technician does not have the benefit of an instant-revive that the Medic has, instead he must use his tool on the target for a few seconds in order to get them back on their feet so make sure that the area is safe beforehand. The Stroyent Cells that the Technician distributes are also different from the GDF MedPacks, since the Strogg uses Stroyent for both ammo and health the cells will yield a set amount of both (making the Technician a very powerful solely combatant as well). Although the most important ability that the Tech brings to the table is the ability to create Spawn Hosts by using his Stoyent Tool on an enemy corpse (instantly gibbing the person forcing them to respawn rather than waiting for a Medic, very important so keep that in mind), a Spawn Host can then be used (one-time only) by either you or a team-mate, respawning you in-placewith full health and ammo.  Any good Technician should have creating Spawn Hosts as a top priority once a battle dies down. <br/><br/> <u><b><i>Constructor</i></b></u><br/>Main Weapon: Lacerator/Plasma Launcher (unlock)/NailGun<br/>Sec Weapon: Blaster<br/>Grenades: Sharp Grenades<br/>Tool(s): Repair Drone, Deploy Tool<br/>Item(s): GravMine<br/><br/><b>Class Description:</b><br/>Same as the Engineer with the exception of being able to repair objects from a distance once the Flying Repair Drone is unlocked.<br/> <u><b><br/><i>Oppressor</i></b></u><br/>Main Weapon: Lacerator/Accurized Lacerator (unlock)<br/>Sec Weapon: Blaster<br/>Grenades: Sharp Grenades<br/>Tool(s): Deploy Tool, Targeting Tool<br/>Item(s): Tactical Shield, Violator Beacon<br/><br/><b>Class Description:</b><br/>An Oppressor is able to perform many of the tasks that a GDF Field Ops can, there are a few minor differences between the two that make them play very differently while in combat however. The difference lies in the Tactical Shield, the Oppressor does not have the ability to distribute Ammo Packs to his team-mates, instead he's there to deploy shields that'll act as improvised cover on the battlefield. The shield will stop any bullet (both GDF and Strogg) and deflect grenades. Your main objective as an Oppressor should be to run in and deploy cover at critical locations such as hallways and bottlenecks, you should also do your best to keep objectives ccover while your team-mates are working to plant a charge or repair an object. The shield will also stick to vehicles giving added protection, put this on a Hog and it'll be able to withstand two tank shots instead of one. Keep in mind though that the shield swears no allegiance and can be used against you if you placed it in a bad location.<br/><br/> <u><b><i>Infiltrator</i></b></u><br/>Main Weapon: Accurized Lacerator/Railgun<br/>Sec Weapon: Blaster<br/>Grenades: Scrambler Grenades<br/>Tool(s): Hacking Tool, Deploy Tool<br/>Item(s): Flyer Drone, Teleporter<br/><br/><b>Class Description:</b><br/>Much like the Covert Ops. Differences lie in the Flyer Drone and the Teleporter. The Flyer Drone is a remote controlled flying bomb that you can use to scout ahead or send in towards unsupecting enemies, a direct hit will kill any class.

This apparently occurs immediately after the Strogg are beaten back by the GDF in Quake Wars.

The game was later re-released on the Wii Virtual Console and will be released in February 2011 on PlayStation Network by <a href="/hudson-entertainment-inc/3010-419/" data-ref-id="3010-419">Hudson Entertainment</a>. It was also the first game in the "Crush Pinball" series followed by three sequels: <a href="/devils-crush/3030-11721/" data-ref-id="3030-11721">Devil's Crush</a>, <a href="/naxat-super-pinball-jaki-hakai/3030-28168/" data-ref-id="3030-28168">Jaki Crush</a> (only released in Japan for the Super Famicom), and <a href="/alien-crush-returns/3030-23215/" data-ref-id="3030-23215">Alien Crush Returns</a>. Alien Crush was a launch title for the TurboGrafx-16 in North America.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">Alien Crush only has one table, two screens high, to play on. It is played from a top down perspective, and both the bottom and top halves of the table contain their own flippers that the player controls. The table contains various areas with ball entries, some of which lead to small bonus tables where the main task consists of destroying different alien creatures with the ball for points. As soon as a ball is lost, the bonus table ends and the player is sent back to the main table. The main goal in Alien Crush is to collect as much points as possible before losing all of the balls, and once that happens the game is then over and requires having to restart. The player can interact with different things on the pinball table to help them by making it harder to lose the ball, and gain more points etc.. Some areas require that the player performs various objectives, and randomly having to face bosses, which can be difficult to defeat without losing the ball. Also on the table are numerous moving targets as well as ball locks, which lock the ball in place for a few seconds before shooting it back out.</p><p style="">The player can also choose between fast or slow ball speed, and having two different music tracks.</p><h2>PS Vita Compatibility</h2><p style="">Despite not being in the official compatibility list, Alien Crush can be played on the PS Vita. To do this, the user must first download the game to the PS3. From there, go to Content Transfer on the PS Vita and select the game for transfer. Once complete, the game will show up on the Vita's menu.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>19109</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/9/93770/2365509-tg16_aliencrush_3.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93770/2365509-tg16_aliencrush_3.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/9/93770/2365509-tg16_aliencrush_3.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/9/93770/2365509-tg16_aliencrush_3.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/9/93770/2365509-tg16_aliencrush_3.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2365509-tg16_aliencrush_3.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/9/93770/2365509-tg16_aliencrush_3.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Alien Crush]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-6/]]></api_detail_url><id>6</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: E]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>1988-09-14 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-55/]]></api_detail_url><id>55</id><name><![CDATA[TurboGrafx-16]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/turbografx-16/3045-55/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[TG16]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-87/]]></api_detail_url><id>87</id><name><![CDATA[Wii Shop]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/wii-shop/3045-87/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[WSHP]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-88/]]></api_detail_url><id>88</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation Network (PS3)]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-network-ps3/3045-88/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3N]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-116/]]></api_detail_url><id>116</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation Network (PSP)]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-network-psp/3045-116/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PSPN]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-139/]]></api_detail_url><id>139</id><name><![CDATA[Wii U]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/wii-u/3045-139/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[WIIU]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/alien-crush/3030-19109/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[ba2]]></aliases><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-19216/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-04-01 16:45:44</date_added><date_last_updated>2013-04-30 00:17:16</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[Blazing Angels 2: Secret Missions of WWII is the second game in the Blazing Angels series.

The team is American, but as the game takes place in the early '40s, when the USA hadn't officially entered the war yet, everything is done clandestinely. The team consists of yourself, British veteran Edward "Teach" Thatcher, engineer and pilot Miles "Milo" Winchester and young, cocky James "Cowboy" Thorpe. You will frequently aid an allied spy called Marguerite, who must operate on the ground while you protect her from the skies. The game features 18 missions, a multiplayer mode (co-operative and adversarial) and upgradeable planes.<br /><br /><h2>Secret Mission Locations</h2><ul class="plain-list"><li><span>Cairo</span></li><li>Moscow</li><li>China</li><li>Himalayas</li><li>Rome<br /></li></ul><br /><h2>Planes</h2><span><span><br /></span></span><ul class="plain-list"><li><span><span>Spitfire I: This British aircraft, dating back to 1940, gained fame fighting the Germans over Britain</span></span></li></ul><ul class="plain-list"><li><span><span>ME 109 E: An advanced fighter for its time, the Emil version of the famous ME 109 was hampered by poor range.</span></span></li><li><span><span>IL-2: This mass-produced Russian plane was heavily armed and armoured, effective at attacking ground targets.</span></span></li><li><span><span>A6M Zero: The Japanese Zero was highly manoeuvrable but lightly armoured, prone to bursting into flames from the slightest damage.</span></span></li><li><span><span>FW 190A: This German plane controlled the French skies when it made its appearance and was known for its excellent speed, roll rate and firepower.</span></span></li><li><span><span>DO-335: A heavy fighter with an unusual push-pull design.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Meteor: The first Allied jet fighter to reach operational status, but it didn't see much use.</span></span></li><li><span><span>ME 163 Komet: Advanced for its time due to the rocket-powered engines.

16:56:20</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[FIFA 08 is the 2008 installment of Electronic Arts' series of football video games. It was developed by EA Canada.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Be A Pro<br/></h2><span>FIFA 08 is the first game in the series that allows players to control a single 'Pro' in 'Be A Pro' mode</span><span>(excluding the goalkeeper)</span><span>, instead of playing as a whole team of 11. The default TV style camera angle, is replaced by a <span>third person</span> camera angle behind their chosen Pro, this allows for a view down the pitch that would match a view seen by a real Pro, the rest of the team are controlled by the AI.<br/><br/>While controlling the specific players movement and possession, the player can influence the AI players around them and also see a series of indicators on the screen to help the player. <br/><br/> <h3>Indicators</h3></span> <ul class="plain-list"><li><strong>Performance Bar</strong> - This small status bar at the bottom of the screen lets the player know how well they're playing. It is made up of red and green halves which move respective to how well the player is playing, for example if the player is playing quite well the bar may be 70% green with the rest showing red, if the player then makes a bad pass the red section of the bar will grow to represent the negative play. Positive plays include making complete passes, having shots, good positioning, tackling and of course scoring goals, negative plays can include misplacing passes, bad positioning and bad tackling. The bar can be hidden if the player wishes.<br/> </li> <li><strong>Positioning Arrow </strong>- An arrow at the feet of the player that helps the player keep in the right position respective to the position being played in, also the number of arrows represent how fast the player needs to get back into position. For example if the player is playing as a centre back, if the player strays to far up the pitch the arrows will show to tell the player to stay with the defensive line. This can be turned off.<br/> </li> <li><strong>Offside Flag</strong> - This is simply an offside flag that appears on-screen when the players Pro gets to near the offside line, letting the player know to run back. </li> <li><strong>Threat Ring</strong> - A red ring is placed beneath an opposing Pro that represents a threat, this tells the player to watch or mark that opposing Pro. This can be more than one Pro for example a defender may have two forwards to deal with. This can be turned off.</li> </ul> <br/> <h3>Commands<br/></h3> <ul class="plain-list"><li><strong>Call for a Pass or Cross</strong> - Players can press the pass button to 'call' for a pass from the AI team mate in possession, however this does not always guarantee the player will receive the ball, if the player is decided a bad option by the AI the 'call' will be ignored. </li> <li><strong>Call for a Through Pass</strong> - Similar to the call for a pass, the player has the option to 'call' for a through ball to run onto from an AI team mate, by pressing the through pass button<br/> </li> <li><strong>Call for a Shot</strong> - If the player decides that an AI team mate is in a good position to shoot then the player can 'tell' the team mate to take a shot on goal. </li> <li><strong>Call for a Second Defender</strong> - When the opposing team has possession the player can press and hold the shoot button to 'tell' an AI team mate to apply defensive pressure.<br/></li> </ul> <h3>Pro Performance</h3><br/>At the end of a 'Be a Pro' match a Pro Performance screen is displayed which shows good stats such as goals, bad stats such as missed shots, preferred player, a final rating and then a performance comment.<br/><br/><strong>Be A Pro Modes</strong><br/><br/><strong>Be A Pro: Offline Training</strong> - This mode allows players to take part in a normal match in Be A Pro mode, this is really a mode designed for practising for online play.<br/><br/><strong>Be A Pro: Online Team Play</strong> - In November 2007 EA released a patch to the PS3 and Xbox 360 systems adding the online Be A Pro mode, this allowed up to 10 players on unique consoles* to play at one time with each team having a maximum of 5 human players, the rest controlled by AI. However players can select to have a roaming role so that they can switch to what player they want to control. EA have stated that their aim is to achieve 10 v 10 online multiplayer which may be seen in FIFA 08's sequal, FIFA 09.<br/><br/>*<em>To avoid confusion the online Be A Pro mode does not allow cross platform play, eg Xbox Live users cannot play Playstation Network users.</em><br/><br/> <h2>Game Modes</h2>Be a Pro is only one of many other game modes.<br/><br/> <ul class="plain-list"><li><strong>Kick Off</strong> - A quick start option, to allow the player to quickly get into a match. </li> <li><strong>Tournament Mode</strong> - This allows players to play through 50 real world tournaments such as the English 'FA Cup', Spanish 'Copa Del Rey' or the German 'Bundesliga'.<br/> </li> <li><strong>Create a Tournament</strong> - A mode in which players can create their own tournament, choosing options such as Tournament type, number of teams, suspension rule, red card match ban and number of subs allowed on the bench. </li> <li><strong>Manager Mode</strong> - A season style mode where you 'manage' a chosen team for a season improving both your teams stats and your own stats as a manager. You are able to deal with transfers, upgrade backroom staff to improve your teams performance, scout players and decided what sponsorship deal the team should sign. The player can either play through the matches or choose to simulate a match. </li> <li><strong>FIFA 08 Lounge Mode</strong> - A mode where the player can select teams for a league and can also have local multiplayer involved if they so wish. However the league point system is not the standard 3 for a win 1 for a draw, points are awarded for accomplishing things in matches, for example, 10 points for a clean sheet, the league is based on this point system. You can also get cheap shots which you can use to give your opponent a disadvantage such as 3 of their players are all ready on a yellow card or start the match at 1 - 0. </li> <li><strong>Challenge Mode</strong> - There are 10 different 'regions' all which have 10 or 15 'challenges' in them for the player to complete, greatly varying in difficulty. Sometimes the player can choose what team they will play as others the team is all ready decided. For example Region 1 includes the Barclays Premier League, Coca-Cola Championship, Coca-Cola League 1, Coca-Cola League 2, SPL and the FAI Eircom League, then a challenge may be to selct a team and then score a goal with a randomly selected player and win the match in regular time. It can be the classic style gameplay or use the new Be A Pro play mode.</li> </ul> <br/> <h2>Leagues in FIFA 08</h2>The following are the leagues present in FIFA 08, as they appear in-game,  where the playable teams are correct to the start of the 07-08 season:<br/><br/> <h3>Americas</h3> <ul class="plain-list"><li>Liga Do Brasil (BRA)<br/> </li> <li><span>Major League Soccer (US/CA)<br/></span> </li> <li><span>Primera División (MEX)<br/></span></li> </ul> <br/> <h3>Asia</h3> <ul class="plain-list"><li>K-League (KOR)</li> </ul> <br/> <h3>Australasia</h3> <ul class="plain-list"><li>A-League (AU/NZ)</li> </ul> <br/> <h3>Europe</h3> <ul class="plain-list"><li>T-Mobile Bundesliga (AUT)<br/> </li> <li>Belgian League (BEL)<br/> </li> <li>Czech League (CZH)<br/> </li> <li>SAS Ligaen (DEN)<br/> </li> <li>Barclays Premier League (ENG)<br/> </li> <li>Coca-Cola Championship (ENG/WAL)<br/> </li> <li>Coca Cola League 1 (ENG/WAL) </li> <li>Coca Cola League 2 (ENG/WAL)<br/> </li> <li>Ligue 1 Orange (FRA/MON)<br/> </li> <li>Ligue 2 Orange (FRA)<br/> </li> <li>Bundesliga (GER)<br/> </li> <li>2.

The game centers around two convicts, <a href="/adam-kane-marcus/3005-5440/" data-ref-id="3005-5440">Adam "Kane" Marcus</a> and <a href="/james-lynch/3005-6224/" data-ref-id="3005-6224">James Seth Lynch</a>, and their struggle against a mercenary group named The7. The game has a sixteen mission campaign which supports two-person local split-screen cooperative play, and online multiplayer for up to eight players.</p><h2>Plot</h2><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3419/565543-kaneandlynch_2008_08_10_5.png" data-ref-id="1300-565543" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.8" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3419/565543-kaneandlynch_2008_08_10_5.png" data-ref-id="1300-565543"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3419/565543-kaneandlynch_2008_08_10_5.png"></a></figure><p style="">The game's story centers mainly around two convicts, Kane, a former mercenary, and Lynch, a man whose psychotic rages are held in check only by prescription drugs. On the way to their execution, Kane and Lynch are broken out of a prison van by The7, Kane's old mercenary group. There is a catch, however: The7, believing Kane betrayed them, want Kane to get them their money back, and threaten to kill his wife and daughter, Jenny, if he does not comply.</p><p style="">Kane embarks on the mission first with only Lynch, robbing a bank where the money was supposed to be held. Finding nothing, a seething Kane books flights to Tokyo to find a Mr. Retomoto who Kane believes has the money. During negotiations, Lynch, with no more medication, goes berserk, killing Retomoto's daughter. Retomoto is infuriated, and Kane and Lynch flee the country. Without Retomoto's share, the two only recover half of the money in the end, and The7 attempt to kill them when they attempt to explain.</p><p style="">After escaping, the two visit a maximum security prison to break out some old friends, Thapa, Shelly, and Rific. Kane and company then go after The7 for Jenny and revenge; but first, they head to Tokyo, killing Mr. Retomoto for his money. The men track The7 to Havana, Cuba, where the ring is involved in a civil war for profit. Joining the opposing side of the war, Kane and company fight to the center of the city, where they learn that The7 have already fled to a remote wilderness base.</p><p style="">Upon arrival, Kane finds Jenny, who is taken into a nearby town held by The7. After killing Jenny's captors, Kane and company attempt to secure the airstrip for their escape, but the planes are blown up and the group overwhelmed, and Kane is left with two choices: take the two-person helicopter with his wounded daughter and desert even Lynch, or flee to the nearby docks with both and leave the rest of the team behind.</p><h2>Fragile Alliance</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11097/233089-kanelynchdeadmen1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-233089" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11097/233089-kanelynchdeadmen1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-233089"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11097/233089-kanelynchdeadmen1.jpg"></a><figcaption>Bank robberies are a common scenario for Fragile Alliance.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Kane &amp; Lynch's multiplayer component is known as Fragile Alliance, a semi-competitive, semi-cooperative game mode. Up to eight players are tasked with stealing as much money as possible from a bank or other institution and getting to the extraction point, where they wait for a van or chopper.</p><p style="">The twist is that at any time, anyone can turn on the rest of the group in an attempt to take all of the money for themselves. Doing so will label the player as a traitor, and the one who takes him down will be rewarded. When a player is killed (by AI enemies or a traitor), they respawn as a police officer, who must now attempt to kill the remaining thieves.</p><h2>Role In The Creation of Giant Bomb</h2><p style="">Kane &amp; Lynch: Dead Men is what some consider to be the whole reason why Giant Bomb exists. On November 28th, 2007, then-Editorial Director <a href="/jeff-gerstmann/3040-89712/" data-ref-id="3040-89712">Jeff Gerstmann</a> was let go from GameSpot due to reasons that could not be disclosed at the time. It was around when Kane &amp; Lynch was near to its launch date and its publisher, Eidos Interactive, was heavily advertising the game on GameSpot. After its release, Gerstmann gave Kane &amp; Lynch a 6.0 rating and criticized its flawed character design and poor dialogue. This created speculation from fans that Eidos was very unhappy with the review and that CNET (GameSpot's parent company) responded to the pressure by firing Gerstmann.</p><p style="">This created an uproar amongst the gaming community with gamers deliberately giving Kane &amp; Lynch a very low score on GameSpot as a sign of protest. After Gerstmann's dismissal, <a href="/vinny-caravella/3040-93491/" data-ref-id="3040-93491">Vinny Caravella</a>, <a href="/ryan-davis/3040-93335/" data-ref-id="3040-93335">Ryan Davis</a>, <a href="/brad-shoemaker/3040-89869/" data-ref-id="3040-89869">Brad Shoemaker</a> and <a href="/alex-navarro/3040-61949/" data-ref-id="3040-61949">Alex Navarro</a> left the company as well. Together, GiantBomb was created and the rest is history.</p><p style="">On March 15, 2012, the day GiantBomb was acquired by CBS Interactive - current owner of GameSpot. The term was that the acquisition can only be made if Gerstmann was allowed to reveal to the public for the first time the cause of the infamous dismissal in 2007, to which CBS agreed. An archive of the stream can be found <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/video/gamespot-and-giant-bomb-together-6366598/">here</a>.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><table><tbody><tr><td>1.</td><td>"Kane's Family

Studio before they were closed due to poor sales. It was released for the PC, Xbox 360, PS3 and PSP in late 2007.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">SEGA Rally Revo is the latest game in the <a href="/sega-rally/3025-446/" data-ref-id="3025-446">Sega Rally</a> series. It is an offroad racing game developed by <a href="/sega-racing-studio/3010-6194/" data-ref-id="3010-6194">SEGA Racing Studio</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solihull" rel="nofollow">Solihull, England</a>, and published by <a href="/sega/3010-62/" data-ref-id="3010-62">SEGA</a>; the PSP version was developed by <a href="/bugbear-entertainment-ltd/3010-991/" data-ref-id="3010-991">Bugbear Entertainment</a>; released on the PC, PS3, Xbox 360 and PSP in late 2007, first in Australia on September 27th and Europe the following day, where it was titled simply Sega Rally. Revo is short for revolution, as Sega Racing Studio had hoped the game would alter the way players and developers thought about rally games. Sega Racing Studios has since been closed and bought out by <a href="/codemasters/3010-491/" data-ref-id="3010-491">Codemasters</a>, today's most prolific and respected publisher of rally racing games. This is a return to earlier beginnings however as a number of SRS's employees had originally come from Codemasters.</p><h2><b>Gameplay</b></h2><p style="">SEGA Rally Revo features over 30 rally vehicles, including newer and classic models, and has six varied locations containing a total of sixteen tracks. As well as local <a href="/split-screen-multiplayer/3015-322/" data-ref-id="3015-322">split screen multiplayer</a>, there is a six player <a href="/online/3015-559/" data-ref-id="3015-559">online mode</a>.</p><p style="">The gameplay itself is a meld of arcade-style handling and pace with a realistic presentation. One of the game's most unique features is the <a href="/track-deformation/3015-745/" data-ref-id="3015-745">deformable terrain</a>. Throughout a race, the racing surface will get eaten into and chopped up by the cars, and this has a very tangible effect on the handling. The cars will slide more and will be much harder to control on patches that have been driven over many times, and can end up skidding off-track if not careful.</p><p style="">The vehicle models themselves also get splattered by mud and become dusty in a realistic manner according to the track type, meaning that it can appear lifelike despite the over the top handling. This effect is present in the PSP version as well.</p><h2>Reception</h2><p style="">The game was generally praised, with the Gamerankings and Metacritic scores for each version all sitting at roughly 70-80%. Some were more eager than others, and it should be noted it appears to have been received more warmly in Europe than North America, with almost all UK and Europe scores sitting at above 80, whilst mostly North American sites and magazines gave it scores below this mark.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>20132</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/1/13158/961163-gb.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/13158/961163-gb.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/1/13158/961163-gb.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/13158/961163-gb.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/13158/961163-gb.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/13158/961163-gb.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/1/13158/961163-gb.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Sega Rally Revo]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>1</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-7/]]></api_detail_url><id>7</id><name><![CDATA[PEGI: 3+]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-6/]]></api_detail_url><id>6</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: E]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-25/]]></api_detail_url><id>25</id><name><![CDATA[CERO: A]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-14/]]></api_detail_url><id>14</id><name><![CDATA[OFLC: G]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2007-10-09 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-18/]]></api_detail_url><id>18</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation Portable]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-portable/3045-18/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PSP]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-116/]]></api_detail_url><id>116</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation Network (PSP)]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-network-psp/3045-116/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PSPN]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/sega-rally-revo/3030-20132/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[Elder Scrolls 4]]></aliases><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20238/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-04-01 16:53:01</date_added><date_last_updated>2015-07-10 06:55:56</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[Travel the continent of Tamriel, defend the land against Oblivion's Daedra hordes,  and help fill the empty throne of Cyrodiil in the fourth installment of the Elder Scrolls series.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Oblivion is an action-oriented role-playing game providing players with a world they can traverse at will. Though the core storyline provides a linear, mission-driven experience, the player is free to pursue a staggering number of side quests that slowly develop and improve their character. Players are free to explore the open world of Cyrodiil however they wish, giving Oblivion a unique Sandbox element. The game was developed by <a href="../../bethesda-softworks/65-786/" rel="nofollow">Bethesda Softworks</a> for the PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. Bethesda also released a Game Of The Year Edition and a Collector's Edition.</p><p style="">Todd Howard said that originally the easier route was to do a two year sequel, but through much persuasion he managed to convince the "upper management" to give them four years to work on Oblivion. This meant that the team would be developing the game for next gen consoles that didn't even exist yet. In fact, the team didn't get final hardware until the last six months or so of development.</p><h3>Plot</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11570/596804-_240552375.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-596804" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.75135135135135" data-width="370" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 370px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11570/596804-_240552375.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-596804"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11570/596804-_240552375.jpg"></a><figcaption>The Great Gate</figcaption></figure><p style="">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion takes place in the same universe as its predecessors; <a href="../../the-elder-scrolls-arena/61-7513/" rel="nofollow">Arena</a>, <a href="../../the-elder-scrolls-daggerfall/61-1129/" rel="nofollow">Daggerfall</a>, and <a href="../../the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind/61-17367/" rel="nofollow">Morrowind</a>, though its specific storyline is original. The game is set in the imperial province of <a href="../../cyrodiil/95-127/" rel="nofollow">Cyrodiil</a>, an expansive territory spanning several square miles. Oblivion casts the player as a prisoner within the jail of the <a href="../../the-imperial-city/95-1659/" rel="nofollow">Imperial City</a>, imprisoned for an unspecified crime. The player soon encounters the <a href="../../emperor-uriel-septim-vii/94-289/" rel="nofollow">Emperor</a> himself (voiced by <a href="../../patrick-stewart/72-19670/" rel="nofollow">Patrick Stewart</a>), who later dies and gives the player character the <a href="../../amulet-of-kings/93-1036/" rel="nofollow">Amulet Of Kings</a> to give to his son <a href="../../martin-septim/94-1991/" rel="nofollow">Martin</a> (voiced by <a href="../../sean-bean/72-89880/" rel="nofollow">Sean Bean</a>), the new heir to the throne, who the player has to protect from a <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/daedra/3015-1826/" data-ref-id="3015-1826">Daedric Prince</a> named <a href="../../mehrunes-dagon/94-2931/" rel="nofollow">Mehrunes Dagon</a>. Dagon is the ruler of the hellish plane of Oblivion, and seeks to conquer the mortal realm with his Daedric armies and the help of a mysterious cult called the '<a href="../../mythic-dawn/92-1827/" rel="nofollow">Mythic Dawn</a>'. At the same time, trans-dimensional portals known as <a href="../../oblivion-gate/93-871/" rel="nofollow">Oblivion Gates</a> appear throughout Cyrodiil and spawn monsters across the landscape.</p><p style="">After leaving the prison, the player heads to Weynon Priory to locate a man named Jauffre, who is the Grandmaster of the Blades (the guards assigned to protect the Emperor). He directs the player to the city of <a href="../../kvatch/95-142/" rel="nofollow">Kvatch</a>, where he believes the last son of Uriel Septim is located. The player heads there and manages to locate Martin; unfortunately, the entire city is being destroyed by Daedric forces, as an Oblivion Gate opened in the middle of it. The player hooks up with the guards defending Kvatch and after a lengthy battle manages to drive the Daedra out. Martin then agrees to travel to Weynon Priory to see Jauffre and get the Amulet of Kings. However, when they arrive they are attacked by Assassins. The player successfully repulses the invaders, but they discover that the Amulet of Kings is no longer in their possession.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1137481-oblivion62.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1137481" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1137481-oblivion62.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1137481"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/17172/1137481-oblivion62.jpg"></a><figcaption>Mehrunes Dagon</figcaption></figure><p style="">In order to track down the culprits, the player heads to the Imperial City and meets up with <a href="/baurus/3005-5760/" data-ref-id="3005-5760">Baurus</a>, who was present when Uriel Septim was murdered. Together they discover the location of a Mythic Dawn shrine, the faction that orchestrated the assassination. The player infiltrates the shrine and manages to steal the Mysterium Xarxes, an evil tome written by Mehrunes Dagon himself. Martin then realizes that they need to open a portal to Mankar Camoran's Paradise, the man that is in possession of the Amulet of Kings. The player then goes treasure hunting, gathering up the necessary items needed to open the portal. He/she retrieves the Armor of Tiber Septim (which has the Divine's blood on it), a Great Welkynd Stone, and the Great Sigil Stone from the Great Gate. With these Martin is able to successfully open a portal to Paradise, and the player ventures into it. The player is able to kill Mankar Camoran and escapes with the Amulet of Kings.</p><p style="">Unfortunately, all hell has broken loose in the Imperial City. An Oblivion Gate opens, and Mehrunes Dagon himself makes an appearance to reign destruction of everything. A huge battle ensues, and the player escorts Martin to the Temple of the One. At the same time, Dagon smashes through the roof and is about to kill both of them when Martin makes the ultimate sacrifice. He fuses all of the powers and transforms into the Avatar of Akatosh. The two of them battle, and Martin is able to defeat Dagon. However, the creature he has turned into freezes into stone, an eternal monument representing his ultimate sacrifice to save Cyrodiil.</p><h3>Side Quests</h3><p style="">Apart from the main quest, numerous guilds offer to recruit the player; each with different specialties and flavors. The Fighters Guild and Mages Guild quest lines are pretty straight-forward, while others, like the Arena make the player get creative against progressively difficult A.I. gladiators. The <a href="../../the-dark-brotherhood/92-2307/" rel="nofollow">Dark Brotherhood</a> and <a href="../../the-thieves-guild/92-2321/" rel="nofollow">Thieves Guild</a> quest lines require the player to murder and steal, respectively. Apart from the guild quests there are many other quests in Cyrodiil that lead to great rewards.</p><p style="">Many quests can be completed in more than one way. For example, there is one quest where a player is asked to retrieve a special sword. Once they get the sword, they realize that it clearly belongs to the Castle of Chorral, and at that point they can either return it to the castle or the quest giver, with both options offering different rewards. In addition to side quests are shrine quests that can be taken on when "speaking" to a shrine. There are multiple shrines in the game, each one requiring the player to be a certain level and to make a certain offer before giving the quest. Once the quest is completed, the shrine will give them a reward. One of the possible rewards is the Skeleton Key, which is an unbreakable lockpick.</p><h3>Visuals and Modification</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11986/1415343-elderscrollsoblivionscreenshot11.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1415343" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11986/1415343-elderscrollsoblivionscreenshot11.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1415343"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11986/1415343-elderscrollsoblivionscreenshot11.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11986/1415343-elderscrollsoblivionscreenshot11.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Bloom effects and HDR lighting are all present in Cyrdodiil</figcaption></figure><p style="">Upon release, the game was noted for being visually striking, providing gorgeous vistas and realistic, sprawling environments for the player to explore. The development team worked from real photographs to deliver the best looking game world they could. While <a href="../../the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind/61-17367/" rel="nofollow">Morrowind</a> featured mostly smoothed over terrain, Oblivion has a much bigger focus on flora. Environments were procedurally generated allowing the landscape to be created very quickly. (They even used SpeedTree!) The draw distance in Oblivion is very lengthy, allowing players to see very far out.</p><p style="">Dynamic weather and day/night cycles give Oblivion a realistic feel. At any time the weather can change from sunny to overcast to rainy then back to sunny. The weather also fits certain parts of the game world: if the player goes to the murky swamps, it's probably going to be raining a lot. Likewise, if they go up into the mountains it will probably be snowing.</p><p style="">Bethesda noted the extreme popularity of the previous game, Morrowind, and developed Oblivion to be open to user modification. Soon after release fans began to modify everything from the game's core balance mechanics and inventory interface to specific environmental textures and even something as seemingly insignificant as the effect when drunk.</p><h3>Customization</h3><p style="">The game allows players to have highly <a href="../../customizable-characters/92-155/" rel="nofollow">customizable characters</a>. Their gender, looks, race, and class (custom or default), are all interchangeable. Each class features a specialization mechanic for the twenty one skills, seven major skills, and a bonus for two of the eight different attributes. At the beginning of the game, players choose a race and can alter their character's appearances in many ways, such as adjusting the height of the player character's nose to changing how big their lips are.</p><h3>Changes from Morrowind</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/380/180546-obps311b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-180546" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/380/180546-obps311b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-180546"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/380/180546-obps311b.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/380/180546-obps311b.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Up close and personal</figcaption></figure><p style="">Certain features from Morrowind are not included, with primarily armor and weapon types and skills simplified. For example, Wakizashis and <a href="../../shuriken/93-51/" rel="nofollow">Throwing Stars</a> are not present in the game, as is also the case with the skills Long Blade, Medium Blade and Short Blade. Another important change to the player's interaction with the game world is the removal of the ' <a href="../../levitation/92-1117/" rel="nofollow">Levitate</a>' spell. Players are now able to instantly travel to locations they have previously visited. The Journal, a focus of significant criticism in Morrowind, is a lot more accessible and user-friendly. All conversations with <a href="../../non-player-character/92-967/" rel="nofollow">NPCs</a> now involve full voice-acting, unlike the text-based approach of Morrowind. Another key difference is the fact that enemies did not scale in Morrowind, but do scale in Oblivion based upon the player character's level. Arguably the biggest and most noticeable change from Morrowind is the combat itself. Morrowind took the traditional "dice roll" combat approach which determined whether the player controlled character hit the enemies based upon stats, as well as random chance. This made the game play and feel more like traditional pen and paper RPGs. Oblivion took a more modern approach and essentially made it so if the player controlled character made contact with the enemy, that said enemy took damage. (Every enemy also has a health bar so the player can see how much damage they are causing).</p><h3>Rating Controversy</h3><p style="">Originally, Oblivion was rated T for Teen by the ESRB. However, PC modders soon dug up nude character model art files within the code and applied them to the game, allowing people to play as a topless female character. Around this time, the ESRB also found out about some of the games gruesome violence that they were not aware of when rating the game.</p><p style="">When a game is ready to be rated by the ESRB, the developers submit a questionnaire about the game and a video showing the game's most extreme content. These videos can range from a few minutes of footage to hours of gameplay. The ESRB examines these and rates the game based on what they see. (The ESRB consists of volunteer members who have no affiliation with the game being rated). The ESRB claimed that Bethesda purposefully kept the violence they saw out of their reports to get the game a T rating. They also accused Bethesda of including nudity in the game without telling them. Bethesda responded by saying they did not create nude character art in the code and that the topless mods were created by the community.</p><h2>The Tamrielic Continent</h2><h3>Provinces</h3><p

They are rather proud and are often seen as snobbish, which is a well-deserved description since they refer to the other races as "lesser races."

They are very quick and have forward-jumping attacks. There are many variations of the goblin, thus warranting its own section. They are all found in the outdoors, caves, mines, and forts. Goblins have a 25% chance of dropping lockpicks.</p><p style="">Goblins are divided into tribes.

When having a conversation, the player usually selects from a list of topics that they want to know more about. Occasionally they'll be able to choose an actual dialogue option that can steer a quest in a particular direction. One of the more important options is the Rumors subject. By choosing this, the NPC will tell them about a random rumor about the town they are in or its surroundings, and occasionally a quest can be gained from it.</p><p style="">Players can also activate a persuasion minigame where they try to get the NPC to like them better by telling jokes, admiring them, etc. The speechcraft skill affects the NPCs disposition towards the player character. A higher disposition is necessary for many quests in order to get someone to provide more information.</p><h2>Leveling Up</h2><p style="">Oblivion uses a unique leveling feature that's not seen in many games. Rather than have players earn experience from killing enemies, completing quests, etc., players must practice their major skills before they can advance to the next level. For example, if one wanted to play as a thief, one would level up their character by sneaking and practicing skills associated with thieves. A thief wouldn't level up by casting spells or using battle axes, although leveling up from doing so is still possible if it's a major skill. Likewise, a mage wouldn't advance by sneaking and using swords as quickly as they would by casting spells, and a sword-wielding soldier wouldn't make much progress by throwing fireballs.</p><p style="">A player can still level up when not in combat. One of the skills in the game is athletics. By running, the player character is increasing their athletics skill. Whenever they jump, the acrobatics skill increases. Because of this, it's entirely possible to advance a level by running.</p><h2>Attributes</h2><p style="">Attributes are the player character's personal abilities in different fields. At the beginning of the game they all start at 40, except for Luck which starts at 50. They are affected by what race they choose, and as they level up they can put more points into them. Each attribute, except for luck, is associated with 3 different skills. If the player character levels up those skills, they'll be able to put points into that attribute.</p><ul><li><b>Strength:</b> Strength is most important to characters that work primarily by dealing melee damage. It also determines how much the player can carry before becoming encumbered. Every point in Strength has these effects: 5 lbs. to carrying capacity, 1 to Fatigue Stat, and 0.66% to melee damage. Associated Skills: <i>Blade, Blunt,</i> and <i>Hand-to-Hand.</i></li></ul><ul><li><b>Intelligence:</b> Boosts Magicka slightly. Every point in Intelligence gives the player character 2 Magicka. Associated Skills: <i>Alchemy, Conjuration,</i> and <i>Mysticism.</i></li></ul><ul><li><b>Willpower:</b> Boosts the player character's fatigue resistance and also increases their rate of magicka regeneration. Every point in Willpower provides 1 Fatigue. Associated Skills: <i>Alteration, Destruction,</i> and <i>Restoration.</i> Magicka regeneration increases with every point put into willpower, but the benefit gets smaller over time. The time it takes to recharge from 0 to full Magicka at some Willpower milestones is as follows:</li></ul><blockquote><ul><li>0 Willpower: 131 seconds</li></ul><ul><li>25 Willpower: 80 seconds</li></ul><ul><li>50 Willpower: 58 seconds</li></ul><ul><li>75 Willpower: 45 seconds</li></ul><ul><li>100 Willpower: 35 seconds</li></ul></blockquote><ul><li><b>Agility:</b> Agility is a stat that is good for both melee and ranged characters. It increases the ability to avoid getting knocked down by melee hits, but it also adds to damage with bows. Every point in Agility has the following effects: 1 to Fatigue, 0.66% damage with bows, and increased resistance to knockdowns. Associated Skills: <i>Security, Sneak,</i> and <i>Marksman.</i></li></ul><ul><li><b>Speed:</b> Speed boosts the alacrity of attack and movement. Every point in Speed adds 0.44% movement speed. Associated Skills: Acrobatics, Athletics, and Light Armor.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Endurance:</b> Boosts health, essential for melee fighters. Every point of Endurance provides 2 starting Health, and 0.1 Health per level (rounded down). Associated Skills: <i>Armorer, Block,</i> and <i>Heavy Armor.</i></li></ul><ul><li><b>Personality:</b> Personality affects people's <i>starting</i> disposition toward the player character in conversations, though if they have enough money, the right spells, or are good enough at the Speechcraft mini-game, starting disposition is irrelevant. Every point of Personality provides 0.25 points to NPC starting dispositions, so it takes 4 points to increase their disposition by 1. Associated Skills: <i>Illusion, Mercantile,</i> and <i>Speechcraft.</i></li></ul><ul><li><b>Luck:</b> Luck doesn't govern any skills. However, it has a direct effect on all of skills, because the higher the Luck, the better skills will perform. Every point of Luck above 50 provides 0.4 to all skills. Conversely, every point of luck below 50 provides -0.4 to all skills. Luck's effect on skills is detailed in the following equation and table:</li></ul><blockquote><p style=""><i>Skill Level ((Luck-50) X 0.4) = Modified Skill Level</i></p></blockquote><p style="">If the player has a 50 in a skill, their Luck score would affect it like this:</p><blockquote><ul><li>10 Luck -- 34 Skill (-16)</li></ul><ul><li>20 Luck -- 38 Skill (-12)</li></ul><ul><li>30 Luck -- 42 Skill (-8)</li></ul><ul><li>40 Luck -- 46 Skill (-4)</li></ul><ul><li>50 Luck -- 50 Skill (No change)</li></ul><ul><li>60 Luck -- 54 Skill ( 4)</li></ul><ul><li>70 Luck -- 58 Skill ( 8)</li></ul><ul><li>80 Luck -- 62 Skill ( 12)</li></ul><ul><li>90 Luck -- 66 Skill ( 16)</li></ul><ul><li>100 Luck -- 70 Skill ( 20)</li></ul></blockquote><h3>Skills and Associated Categories</h3><ul><li><b>Combat:</b> Block, Armorer, Heavy Armor, Blunt, Blade, Athletics, Hand-to-Hand</li><li><b>Magic:</b> Destruction, Alteration, Illusion, Conjuration, Mysticism, Restoration, Alchemy</li><li><b>Stealth:</b> Security, Sneak, Acrobatics, Light Armor, Marksman, Mercantile, Speechcraft</li></ul><h2>Birthsigns</h2><ul><li><b>The Apprentice</b></li></ul><p style="">Adds 100 points to the players Magicka attribute, but also gives them a weakness to Magic.</p><ul><li><b>The Atronach</b></li></ul><p style="">Confers a 50% Spell Absorption to recharge Magicka, as it cannot be recharged through resting under this birthsign.</p><ul><li><b>The Lady</b></li></ul><p style="">Confers a bonus of 10 points to Willpower and Endurance.</p><ul><li><b>The Lover</b></li></ul><p style="">The player can paralyze an opponent for 10 by kissing them, but loses 120 points of Fatigue by doing so.</p><ul><li><b>The Lord</b></li></ul><p style="">The player can regenerate health up to 90, but gains a 25% weakness to fire.</p><ul><li><b>The Mage</b></li></ul><p style="">Adds 50 points to Magicka.</p><ul><li><b>The Ritual</b></li></ul><p style="">Grants the Mara's Gift power once a day as a Restore Health spell to use.</p><ul><li><b>The Serpent</b></li></ul><p style="">Gives the Serpent spell to cause a slow but potent poison on touch, while also ridding the player of magic and costing 100 Fatigue.</p><ul><li><b>The Shadow</b></li></ul><p style="">Grants the Moonshadow power once a day, causing the player to become invisible for 60 seconds.</p><ul><li><b>The Steed</b></li></ul><p style="">Adds a bonus of 20 to the player's Speed.</p><ul><li><b>The Thief</b></li></ul><p style="">Adds a bonus of 10 points to Speed, Agility, and Luck.</p><ul><li><b>The Tower</b></li></ul><p style="">Allows the player to open an Average lock or less once per day.

The player can join all five, but some guild rules may conflict with others. Each guild has it's own unique storyline rather than random tasks to complete.</p><ul><li><b>The Mages Guild:</b> The Mages guild is for magic-users, although use of magic isn't completely necessary to complete the quest line. Those who join the guild get access to exclusive spells and the ability to craft their own spells and enchantments.</li></ul><ul><li><b>The Fighters Guild:</b> The Fighters guild is for warriors, although melee weapons aren't completely necessary to complete the quest line. Those who join the guild get access to exclusive weapons and training.</li></ul><ul><li><b>The Thieves Guild:</b> The Thieves guild is for rogues and thieves. Those who join the guild can sell stolen property and remove bounties on their heads for a price without losing their stolen goods.</li></ul><ul><li><b>The Dark Brotherhood:</b> The Dark Brotherhood is for assassins. Those who join the guild get access to exclusive armor and weapons for silently killing enemies. Unlike the other guilds, the Dark Brotherhood cannot be joined by simply walking into a building and asking.

Unlike many of Bethesda's add-ons for earlier games, which were large expansion packs that took place away from the world of the base game, Knights of the Nine is much smaller in scope, providing ten or so new quests into the existing lands of Cyrodiil. In this way, it is very similar to various guild sidequests found in Oblivion.</p><p style="">Upon installing Knights of the Nine, the player hears rumors of an attack on the church in the town of Anvil. After visiting the Prophet, who tells tale of the second coming of the evil Umaril, the player must reform the order of the Knights of the Nine and search for the lost Crusader's Relics before finally taking on Umaril himself.</p><p style="">Besides the new quests, Knights of the Nine also adds new Ayleid ruins, forts, and caves, as well as the Priory of the Nine, which becomes the knights' base of operations. Minor changes are also made to a few existing locations, such as the aforementioned ruined Anvil Chapel. Additionally, several new enemies and items are added to the game, which the player can then use throughout the rest of Oblivion.</p><p style="">Originally, Knights of the Nine was available as downloadable content from Bethesda's website, as well as on the Xbox Live Marketplace. Additionally, it was available on a retail disc that also included seven of the other eight official plug-ins (the Fighter's Stronghold is not included). Later, Knights of the Nine was included along with the Shivering Islands retail box, as well as included in the Game Of The Year edition of Oblivion. As the PS3 version of Oblivion was released later than the PC and 360 versions, Knights of the Nine was included on the Oblivion game disc.</p><h2>The Elder Scrolls IV: Shivering Isles</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/458/219515-si_17b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-219515" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/458/219515-si_17b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-219515"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/458/219515-si_17b.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/458/219515-si_17b.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Entering the Realm of Madness</figcaption></figure><p style="">The <a href="../../the-elder-scrolls-iv-shivering-isles/61-10740/" rel="nofollow">Shivering Isles</a> is the first and only <b>expansion pack</b> for Oblivion. The extra content leads the player to the Daedric prince <a href="../../sheogorath/94-2792/" rel="nofollow">Sheogorath</a>'s Realm of Madness, which consists of an entirely new map to explore. The realm is effectively split down the middle. The "light" side, Mania, is filled with inhabitants delirious and manic and a color saturated environment to reflect that. The "dark" side, Dementia, is inhabited by the paranoid and depressed, as reflected in its grim environments. The capital city of New Sheoth is similar with Crucible (Dementia), Bliss (Mania), and the Palace District (exact middle and home of Sheogorath), reflecting the two sides of the world, its god and his divided nature.</p><p style="">In the main quest, the player is recruited by Sheogorath to stop a Ragnarok-style event called the Greymarch. Jyggalag, Daedric Prince of Order and the polar opposite to the Prince of Madness, returns at the end of every era to purge the Realm of Madness, forcing Sheogorath to rebuild his domain. With the player as his champion, Sheogorath plans to fight back. He sends the player on many quests to try and put an end to the Greymarch.</p><p style="">However, the player ultimately fails and Sheogorath transforms into Jyggalag. The player is able to defeat Jyggalag, and when the fight is over Jyggalag explains that because his realm was expanding so fast, the other Daedric Princes put a curse on him that causes Sheogorath to turn into Jyggalag at the end of each era and thus experience the Greymarch over and over again. Because of this, Sheogorath, against his will, destroys his own realm at the end of each era and has to rebuild it (only the destroy it again). He thanks the player for putting a halt to the cycle and considers him/her the new Sheogorath.</p><h2>Collector's Edition</h2><p style="">Upon release of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, Bethesda announced a Collector's Edition version for the PC and Xbox 360. This edition didn’t change any in-game content; instead it offered the player with a unique set of collectable items packaged alongside the game itself. The contents inside the package are:</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13933/317413-col_edition.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-317413" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13933/317413-col_edition.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-317413"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/13933/317413-col_edition.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/13933/317413-col_edition.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Collector's Edition</figcaption></figure><p style=""><b>A Gold Septim coin</b> – This is an authentic replicated Septim coin, which is the official currency of Tamriel.</p><p style=""><b>Pocket guide to the empire</b> – This is a 112 page mini guide to Tamriel.

The game is a crossover between a selection of <a data-ref-id="3025-7" href="/mortal-kombat/3025-7/" slug="mortal-kombat">                              Mortal Kombat</a> fighters and characters from the world of <a data-ref-id="3025-138" href="/dc/3025-138/" slug="dc">                              DC</a> Comics. The game initially announced in April 2008 at Midway's annual press event in Las Vegas. <a data-ref-id="3040-11102" href="/ed-boon/3040-11102/" slug="ed-boon">                              Ed Boon</a>, the co-creator of the Mortal Kombat series, was on-hand to give the initial details and show a brief teaser trailer.<br/><br/> At the time of the game's announcement, only four characters were confirmed as appearing in the game.                        Scorpion and                        Sub-Zero represented the game's Mortal Kombat side.                        Superman and                        Batman were the first two confirmed DC characters. Since that time, the full roster was released via press releases and updating showings of the game at trade shows for both the game and the comic industries. The game's backgrounds cover a variety of famous MK and DC locations.<br/><br/> The story that justifies the tying together of these two groups involves the merging of universes. The chaos that ensues with the DC version of Earth begins coming together with MK's Earthrealm serves as the backdrop for the game. The fighters become infected with "kombat rage," a state in which the urge to battle overtakes their entire body. This is what the game uses to justify situations where "good" characters fight amongst themselves.<br/><br/> This is the first Mortal Kombat game developed for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 and it uses<a data-ref-id="3015-86" href="/unreal-engine-3/3015-86/" slug="unreal-engine-3">  Unreal Engine 3</a>, also a first for the MK series. Along with the new engine, the game's fighting has been redesigned and moves away from the multiple unarmed and weapon-based fighting styles found in the previous PS2/Xbox/GCN games.<br/><br/> Due to the game's crossover with DC Comics and the wider potential audience that brings, Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe was built with an ESRB T (Teen) rating in mind. This means that the grisly fatalities that have become something of a calling card for the MK series are not present in MK vs. DC. However, the game still has finishing moves. Midway has stated that it intended to push this game right up to the line that separates the ESRB's T rating from its M for Mature rating. The European release of the game shows slightly more violence due to the availability of a "15" rating, as opposed to the implied age of 13 in the US. Most notably, the Joker's fatality is censored in the US release. <br/> <h2>Gameplay</h2>Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe is primarily a 2D fighting game. Though players can <a data-ref-id="3015-2478" href="/side-step/3015-2478/" slug="side-step">  side step</a>, the side step is too slight to be very useful up close, maintaining most of the usefulness of projectile attacks. The game places four numbered attack buttons on the face of the controller. On the shoulders is a block button, a sidestep button, a regular throw, and a button to initiate "Klose Kombat" sequences. Unlike the past 2D MK games, MK vs. DC's fighters have varied normal moves as opposed to assigning nearly identical normal attacks to each fighter. Special moves are performed by entering specific motions and button presses on the controller.<br/><br/> Generally speaking, the top two attack buttons are primarily used for punches while the bottom two buttons are usually kicks. This varies by character and by combo. This varies from the classic Mortal Kombat setup, which put high and low punches on the left side of the controls and kicks on the right.<br/><br/> The game's combo system retains many of the same concepts that MK was founded on with plenty of juggle-friendly moves. Up close, some normal attacks can be strung together into combos and like <a data-ref-id="3030-2178" href="/ultimate-mortal-kombat-3/3030-2178/" slug="ultimate-mortal-kombat-3">  Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3</a>, fighters can begin combos from a jumping punch. Jumping punches and kicks will turn around the face foes who end up behind the fighter when the attack button is pressed.<br/><br/> <h3>Mid-Fight Minigames</h3><br/> There are three different in-game systems that take the players out of the standard fighting mechanics and bring them into brief, counter-based minigames. Klose Kombat is a new fight mode that is initiated by pressing the KK button from within throw range. If it connects, the camera zooms up and the action slows a bit. The attacking player can hit any of the face buttons to perform an attack. The defending player attempts to guess which button the attacker will press. If the defender guesses correctly, the Klose Kombat mode is broken. If not, the attacker can attempt another move. This concept also applies to Freefall Kombat, which works while players fall from one level of a stage to the next. In this situation, if the defending player successfully guesses the button press, the attack is countered and the roles switch. After a few successful hits, the player in control can press a button to bust out a special mid-air attack that does extra damage and sends the victim crashing to the ground below.<br/><br/> The third and final in-fight system is Test Your Might, which is a concept that originated as a bonus round in the original <a data-ref-id="3030-15743" href="/mortal-kombat/3030-15743/" slug="mortal-kombat">  Mortal Kombat</a>. Here, however, it's used to give players something to fight over while crashing through buildings horizontally on supported stages. This is basic <a data-ref-id="3015-44" href="/button-mashing/3015-44/" slug="button-mashing">  button mashing</a>, with the attacking player attempting to maximize the damage done while moving to the next part of the stage. The defender also mashes in an attempt to reduce damage.<br/><br/> <h3>Fatalities</h3><br/> With the exception of story mode, finishing moves can be performed by the winner of a fight during a brief window before the match ends. To help differentiate between the "good" DC characters that wouldn't normally kill their opponents, some characters have "heroic brutalities" instead of fatalities. The end result is roughly the same, as both types of finishers trigger flashy animations that result in the definitive defeat of the enemy. Each character has two finishing moves.<br/> <br/> <h2>Roster</h2>Counting the two unlockable characters that are attained by completing  each side of the story mode, there are 22 characters in the game, 11 per  side. The Mortal Kombat side of the roster has been described as a  "greatest hits" roster, consisting entirely of characters who debuted in  Mortal Kombat or <a data-ref-id="3030-3571" href="/mortal-kombat-ii/3030-3571/" slug="mortal-kombat-ii">  Mortal Kombat II</a>.<br/><br/> The DC side of the roster  pulls from a few different places, including obvious choices like  Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman, as well as less-popular characters  like Deathstroke and                        Captain Marvel.<br/><br/> Midway planned to release Quan Chi and Harley Quinn as DLC characters but <a data-ref-id="1100-1527" href="/no-dlc-for-mortal-kombat-vs-dc-universe/1100-1527/" slug="no-dlc-for-mortal-kombat-vs-dc-universe">  those plans were scrapped</a>. <br/><br/> Here is

Ocean.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Marking a shift from the dusty desert terrain found in the original MotorStorm, Pacific Rift takes place in a vibrant tropical island. The players race across the various terrain in this tropical paradise as they deal with the environment as well as rival racers. Mud, undergrowth, vines, trees, lava pools, rivers and lakes will all stand in the way of the goal. These elements will affect the gameplay in different ways, depending on the size of the vehicle. While smaller, lighter vehicles will get slowed by vines and branches, the newly added monster trucks can just plow through such obstacles. Bodies of water will also play a role as they can cool down engines, though they will also slow down the player's vehicle, and venturing into water that's too deep can be catastrophic. The game features four-player split-screen support, as well as 20-player online play. The online servers will be shut down on October 1st, 2012.</p><h2>Vehicle Types</h2><p style="">Here are all the vehicle types in MotorStorm Pacific Rift, including the new addition, the Monster Truck.</p><ul><li>Bike</li><li>ATV</li><li>Buggy</li><li>Rally Car</li><li>Racing Truck</li><li>Mudplugger</li><li>Big Rig</li><li>Monster Truck</li></ul><h2>The Four Zones</h2><p style="">This time, the MotorStorm festival takes place across four distinct, themed zones on The Island, providing 16 varied tracks in all.</p><p style=""><u><b>Fire Zone</b></u>: "Situated deep within The Island's volcanic lava fields, the Fire Zone is full of red-hot dangers forged in natures crucible. Prepare to speed across fiery racetracks characterized by rocky wastelands are creeping sheets of lava."</p><p style=""><u><b>Air Zone</b></u>: "High above the tropical treeline stands the Air Zone, featuring racetracks on sheer cliff edges, fast downhill runs and massive big-air jumps. Lighter vehicles will profit from more control in this landscape - but a Big Rig is just as good for sending opponents crashing into the void."</p><p style=""><u><b>Earth Zone:</b></u> "Dense and dirty, the Earth Zone throws racers deep into The Island's thick jungles and forests. Routes in and around the heavy undergrowth are littered with hazards and visibility is often minimal. You'll need to think fast and make split-second decisions to avoid a mass of deadly obstacles!"</p><p style=""><u><b>Water Zone:</b></u> "From mountain lakes to coastal shores, the Water Zone offers serene beaches, plunging waterfalls and treacherous river canyons. Racetracks are often dangerously narrow as they cut a path through flowing water, so be on the lookout for alternative routes that will lead to dry land."</p><p style="">Often, tracks will have a blend of "zones" so, certain Air tracks will contain lava featured in Fire tracks, and certain Water tracks will have dense jungle and mud seen in Earth tracks etc. This helps prevent the zone's from feeling too sperated and gives The Island, a more natural life-like feel.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><ul><li>Alex Metric - <i>In Your Machine</i></li><li>Amon Tobin - <i>Trickstep (Pacific Rift Mix)</i></li><li>Animal Alpha - <i>Fire!

Fight  Night Round 4 was developed by EA Canada following the dissolution of  the previous FIght Night game developers, EA Chicago. This game focuses  more on inside fighting with a new physics-based style of gameplay. </p><h2>Gameplay </h2> <p style="">The gameplay is similar to previous FIght Night games. The left and  right analogue sticks controls your fighter's movement. Each kind of  punch is based on the movement of the analogue sticks. Punching is  controlled by your right analogue stick and movement with the left  analogue stick with an option to switch to button controls included via a downloadable patch.<br />One  of the improvements over previous entries is the greater distinction  between the fighter's height and reach from each other. This has more  impact on the gameplay than in previous entries, leading to a clearer  distinction between fighters that are stronger in close range and those  who are better at a distance.<br /></p> <figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6242/1041570-untitled.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1041570" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.57389428263215" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:57.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6242/1041570-untitled.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1041570"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6242/1041570-untitled.jpg"></a><figcaption> Improved damage model</figcaption></figure>     Additional enhancements  were made to the damage model with fighters having more hitzones.  Blocking now has a meter, this meter decays over time, your overall risk  increases as the meter decreases. Punches can break through your guard  and your arms can be knocked out of the way more easily as your opponent  wears down your defence. <br /><p style="">The treatment of cuts between  rounds has been changed from previous entries as well. In Round 4, cut  work and the like is based on a points system. You will accumulate  points as fight and then choose to apply them to damaged areas in  between rounds. </p><h2>Legacy Mode  </h2> In Legacy Mode, players start their boxing career using a created boxer  or an existing one. This mode lets the player work their way up the  rankings. Fights are scheduled using the game's calendar. Depending on  the date, the player may get the chance to have one or more training sessions before their next bout.  <br /> <br />The training sessions  raise different attributes and decrease others. These sessions can be  manually performed or can be set to auto. However, using the auto  setting will decrease the amount of points gained. The manual system  awards points based on how well the player performed while exercising.  The number of points gained will slow down if the fighter becomes older  or has reached his peak for a particular section. <br /><p style="">The in-game  calendar tells you when your next fight is scheduled and how long your  fighter will take to recover after each fight. The game simulates the  matches of other boxers when your fighter is not involved. At the end of  each year, awards are given out in categories such as Fighter of the  Year, Round of the Year, and Prospect of the Year.   </p><p style="">Throughout a  fighter's career, the player is sent messages from their trainer  informing them whenever a belt changes hands, making the player aware of  up and coming fighters, and letting the player know when they have been  nominated for an award. <br /> When you complete Legacy mode you are  given a ranking, this will depend on what you did during your career.  </p><h2>Roster</h2><p style="">The roster contains a total of 50 fighters from the past and present of boxing. The weight classes include, Heavyweight, Light Heavy, Middleweight, Welterweight, Lightweight, Featherweight, Bantamweight and Flyweight.<br /></p> <ul class="plain-list"><li>Amin Asikainen<br /></li> <li>Anthony Mundine    <figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1379/948243-tyson_profile.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-948243" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.64804469273743" data-width="358" style="width: 358px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:64.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1379/948243-tyson_profile.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-948243"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1379/948243-tyson_profile.jpg"></a><figcaption>Mike Tyson</figcaption></figure></li> <li>Arementa<br /></li> <li>Arthur Abraham<br /></li> <li>Arturo Gatti<br /></li> <li>Billy Dib<br /></li> <li>Carlos Monzon<br /></li> <li>Corey Spinks<br /></li> <li>Diego Corrales<br /></li> <li>Eddie Chambers<br /></li> <li>Edwim Valero<br /></li> <li>Emanuel Agustus<br /></li> <li>Erik Morales   <figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/23298/1066613-946195_20090528_790screen022.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1066613" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5620253164557" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/23298/1066613-946195_20090528_790screen022.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1066613"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/23298/1066613-946195_20090528_790screen022.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/23298/1066613-946195_20090528_790screen022.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Manny Pacquiao</figcaption></figure></li> <li>Fernando Montiel<br /></li> <li>George Foreman<br /></li> <li>Jake Lamotta<br /></li> <li>James Toney<br /></li> <li>Jermaine Taylor<br /></li> <li>Joe Calzaghe<br /></li> <li>Joe Frazier<br /></li> <li>Jorge Armando Arce<br /></li> <li>Julio Caesar Chavez<br /></li> <li>Kelly Pavlik<br /></li> <li>Kermit Cinteron<br /></li> <li>Lennox Lewis<br /></li> <li>Manny Pacquiao<br /></li> <li>Marco Antonio Barrera   <figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1379/948237-ali_profile.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-948237" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.64804469273743" data-width="358" style="width: 358px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:64.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1379/948237-ali_profile.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-948237"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1379/948237-ali_profile.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1379/948237-ali_profile.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Muhammed Ali</figcaption></figure></li> <li>Marvin Hagler<br /></li> <li>Miguel Cotto<br /></li> <li>Mike Tyson<br /></li> <li>Muhammad Ali<br /></li> <li>Nate Campbell<br /></li> <li>Nonito Donair<br /></li> <li>Paulie Malignaggi<br /></li> <li>Pernell Whittaker<br /></li> <li>Ray Leonard<br /></li> <li>Ray Robinson<br /></li> <li>Ricky Hatton<br /></li> <li>Roberto Duran<br /></li> <li>Roberto Guerrero<br /></li> <li>Ronald "Winky" Wright<br /></li> <li>Roy Jones Jr.<br /></li> <li>Sergio Mora<br /></li> <li>Shane Mosely<br /></li> <li>Thomas Hearns<br /></li> <li>Tommy Morrison<br /></li> <li>Victor Ortiz<br /></li> <li>Vinny Paz<br /></li> <li>Vivian Harris<br /></li> <li>Yuriorkis Gamboa</li></ul><br /><h2>Xbox 360 Hard Drive Install</h2>Installing Fight Night Round 4 takes up about 4.4 GB of space on your hard drive.<br /><br /><h2>Post-Release Updates</h2>On July 28, 2009, EA released a free of charge pack which included a new training gym, new gameplay sliders, and new equipment to outfit boxers.<br />Another update that added a face button control scheme in place of the default layout which is based on using the right analog stick for punches was released.<br /> <br /><h2>Downloadable Content </h2>A new batch of boxers are available for download for 400MS points or $4.99.

It is published by <a href="/thq/3010-15/" data-ref-id="3010-15">THQ</a> and developed by <a href="/swordfish-studios-limited/3010-4277/" data-ref-id="3010-4277">Swordfish Studios</a>, who used <a href="/epic-games/3010-149/" data-ref-id="3010-149">Epic Games</a>' <a href="/unreal-engine-3/3015-86/" data-ref-id="3015-86">Unreal Engine 3</a> for the game's visuals. The gameplay itself is very similar to <a href="/gears-of-war/3025-565/" data-ref-id="3025-565">Gears of War</a>, another Unreal Engine 3 game.</p><p style="">Players take control of <a href="/50-cent/3005-2614/" data-ref-id="3005-2614">50 Cent</a>, flanked by one of his G-Unit sidekicks: <a href="/tony-yayo/3005-7605/" data-ref-id="3005-7605">Tony Yayo</a>, <a href="/lloyd-banks/3005-7604/" data-ref-id="3005-7604">Lloyd Banks</a>, and DJ Whoo Kid, who do not have any differences beyond their appearance and voice acting. Blood on the Sand allows players to go through the game's campaign through two player online co-op; players who host a game online play as 50, while others can instantly drop in and out playing as 50's sidekicks. However, the game does not support split-screen or system link play. Blood on the Sand's soundtrack consists of famous 50 Cent songs as well as some exclusive tracks made just for the game.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">Blood on the Sand's gameplay is similar to Gears of War and other third-person shooters that involve a <a href="/cover-system/3015-55/" data-ref-id="3015-55">cover system</a>. The player can take cover and pop out when enemies are exposed, or blind fire to wear enemies down with less accurate shots. If an enemy is close, players can also use "counter kills," pressing the melee button at the right time in a scripted sequence to successfully finish the foe off. The player can buy weapons from Raoul at pay phones located throughout the stages. The four weapon slots, selectable via the D-Pad, are occupied by different types of weapons: pistols, shotguns/SMGs, assault rifles, and rocket launchers/sniper rifles. There is also a <a href="/bullet-time/3015-78/" data-ref-id="3015-78">bullet time</a> mechanic, nicknamed "Gangsta Fire." Gangsta Fire time is indicated through a fiery meter on the interface, and it is accumulated by building up points; points are obtained by getting kill combos, killing enemies in unique ways, and taunting after a kill.</p><p style="">Another interesting concept brought up during gameplay is that of the '50 Zone' . When using a counter kill whilst between two foes, 50 instantly teleports one of them to the '50 Zone', a featureless white landscape, in which 50 Cent magically appears to murder you in the face, and possibly groin, if he feels so inclined.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14761/1293398-ramp.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1293398" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14761/1293398-ramp.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1293398"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14761/1293398-ramp.jpg"></a><figcaption>Yo, Fifty! Jump over that big-ass ramp!</figcaption></figure><p style="">In addition to the cover-based third person shooter gameplay, there are also a few vehicle stages. In the driving segments, the G-Unit sidekick controls the gunner, but the gun is unusually weak, even on Easy difficulty, and ramming enemies (both human and vehicle) is a far more efficient way of killing them. There are also a few big-ass ramps present during the driving segments; it is recommended that the player hit them. One stage also has 50 and the G-Unit stationed at a helicopter's guns, firing upon enemies below.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p style="">In a fictional <a href="/unnamed-middle-eastern-location/3035-179/" data-ref-id="3035-179">war torn Middle Eastern country</a>, 50 is performing at the last city of his concert tour. The venue's manager, a man named Anwar, does not have the $10 million payment, and instead offers a mysterious diamond-encrusted skull as collateral. 50 accepts, but as he is leaving the town, his convoy is attacked and a mysterious mercenary quickly steals the skull. He and G-Unit are forced to become vigilantes in search of the skull.</p><p style="">After losing the skull, 50 reunites with Anwar. Anwar informs him that the mercenary stole the skull following orders from Kamal, a local drug lord. 50 starts out by meeting up with Raoul, an associate of Anwar who sells powerful black market weapons through the telephone. While pursuing Kamal, the G-Unit is captured by a man named Carter, an American who claims he was once a law enforcer but grew sick of it. Carter tells 50 to intercept Kamal's shipment of gold bars. After he succeeds, Carter turns on him and attempts to gun him down in a helicopter. 50 shoots down Carter's helicopter and learns that Kamal is holed up inside an old theatre. 50 continues his pursuit of Kamal and ultimately kills him by shooting down his helicopter.</p><p style="">As he escapes the roof of the collapsing theatre, Leila, the mercenary who originally stole 50's skull, boards the escape vehicle with him. 50 demands an explanation, and Leila says she stole the skull because a crime baron named Wilder is holding her family hostage. She adds that the skull is now in Wilder's possession. The two briefly flirt before splitting up to infiltrate Wilder's property. The G-Unit finds the skull, but Wilder ambushes them and reveals that Anwar has sided with him. 50 kills Anwar and fights his way out, but Wilder escapes with the skull in his possession.</p><p style="">50 catches up with Wilder and confronts him, but Leila betrays him and holds him at gunpoint, mockingly informing him that she actually has no family. Wilder boards his armored helicopter and attempts to kill 50. After numerous rockets, the G-Unit destroys the helicopter and chases after Leila in a tank. After pursuing Leila's jeep long enough, it topples over and crashes. The victorious G-Unit members take the skull and depart, leaving Leila to die in the desert.</p><h3>Endings</h3><p style="">Blood on the Sand has two slightly different endings. The ending that the player receives is based on a decision made late in the game. While breaking into Wilder's property, 50 can choose to break some electrical switches in order to open up a quicker path forward, but Leila communicates with him via radio and informs him that if he chooses to do so, Wilder's men will attack her.</p><p style="">If the player chooses to break the mechanism and take the straightforward path, the ending will show the G-Unit taking a skull from an unnamed enemy, with Leila nowhere to be found (although she still survives up to that point). If the player opts to "sneak around" (however, this path still has enemy resistance), they will see the G-Unit take the skull from an exhausted and injured Leila, as she pleads with 50 to grant her forgiveness.</p><p style="">Considering that Leila betrays 50 no matter what the player chooses to do, the idea that Wilder's men would attack Leila is somewhat strange and a question that goes unanswered.</p><h2>Extras</h2><p style="">Unlockable extras for the game include various cheats such as infinite ammo and invincibility (these disable the player from gaining any <a href="/achievements/3015-29/" data-ref-id="3015-29">achievements</a> or <a href="/playstation-trophies/3015-198/" data-ref-id="3015-198">trophies</a>), as well as concept art of characters and locations. The player is also able to unlock a small number of 50 Cent music videos to watch.</p><h2>Development</h2><p style="">Though the game was originally scheduled to be published by <a href="/vivendi-games/3010-6398/" data-ref-id="3010-6398">Vivendi</a>, Blood on the Sand was dropped following the company's merger with <a href="/activision/3010-78/" data-ref-id="3010-78">Activision</a> that resulted in the formation of <a href="/activision-blizzard-inc/3010-6397/" data-ref-id="3010-6397">Activision Blizzard</a>.

Rather than sticking with the developer's multiplayer-heavy roots, <i>Haze</i> is more of a story-driven, single-player-focused game. The game does have a multiplayer mode though, as well as a four-player co-op option for the story. The game was published by <a href="/ubisoft-entertainment/3010-82/" data-ref-id="3010-82">Ubisoft</a> in all territories. When it was first announced, it was supposed to be on the <a href="/xbox-360/3045-20/" data-ref-id="3045-20">Xbox 360</a> and <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC</a> as well as the <a href="/playstation-3/3045-35/" data-ref-id="3045-35">PlayStation 3</a>, but at some point in the game's development, it went <a href="/playstation-3/3045-35/" data-ref-id="3045-35">PS3</a> only.</p><p style="">Prior to game's release, <i>Haze</i> made an affiliation with Korn. This spawned a popular internet meme from the reactions of the cast of the HotSpot podcast to Johnathan Davis' agent's quote on the game which is: "Gaming for me is a religion, and <i>Haze</i> is the shit! I had to come up with a track that can hit up that kind of rush I get from the game, and I think we really rocked it!!"</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11105-HAZE_Screenshot_CrashedPlane02 _2007December03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11105" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0" style="width: 1px"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11105-HAZE_Screenshot_CrashedPlane02 _2007December03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11105"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png"></a></figure><p style="">Players take on the role of <a href="/shane-carpenter/3005-14656/" data-ref-id="3005-14656">Shane Carpenter</a>, a newly-enlisted soldier with the Mantel Corporation, who is entering into a foreign country, ostensibly to fight a dictator that they have nicknamed "Skin Coat," due to reports of natives being skinned and eaten alive. Soldiers working for Mantel are suited up in intelligent armor that monitors health and delivers a steady supply of a drug known as Nectar. Nectar can also be manually administered, giving players extra speed, more health, and greater accuracy while active. Nectar withdrawals, however, are a nasty thing, and after a couple of brief missions, you're shown exactly what Nectar is doing to the soldiers.</p><p style="">It's no surprise that Carpenter switches sides over the course of the game, and it's no spoiler, either -- <a href="/ubisoft-entertainment/3010-82/" data-ref-id="3010-82">Ubisoft</a> has gone so far as to reveal that this happens on the back of the game's box, and this fact was a major part of the information released prior to <i>Haze</i>'s release. However, in the game, it is treated as a major plot twist, which confuses many players.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11118-HAZE_Screenshot_LandCarrier4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11118" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11118-HAZE_Screenshot_LandCarrier4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11118"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/11118-HAZE_Screenshot_LandCarrier4.jpg"></a></figure><p style="">Besides the single-player campaign, <i>Haze</i> has four-player co-op throughout the story and a 16-player multiplayer component with three basic modes. The rebel and Mantel units again collide here, with the Mantel troops having the ability to use Nectar and the rebel troops using the ability to play dead, which makes them disappear to the eyes of their Nectar-addled opponents.</p><h2>Weaponry</h2><p style="">In <i>Haze</i> you acquire many new weapons designed either for Mantel or The Promise Hand.</p><h3>Mantel Weapons</h3><ul><li><b>The ‘Diplomat’- Wilson D6 Pistol</b><br />The ‘Diplomat’ is the side-arm of choice for the smart Mantel trooper. It’s got the kind of stopping power that makes the bad guys feel like they were hit by a steam train full of anvils. It’s especially good at close range “when negotiations fail” – hence it’s nickname.</li></ul><ul><li><b>The ‘BlackSaw’ - BSW-72 Assault Rifle</b><br />The ‘BlackSaw’ is the standard issue rifle, but there ain’t nothing standard about it. This baby fires rounds made from depleted uranium, meaning that not only do you kill your opponent, you give them radiation poisoning too. Yee-ha!</li></ul><ul><li><b>The ‘BlackSaw’ (Suppressed) - BSW-72(S) Assault Rifle</b><br />This sleek silenced version of the standard issue BlackSaw marginally reduces bullet velocity and rate of fire in exchange for near-silent firing. The perfect tool in covert operations.</li></ul><ul><li><b>The ‘Donkey Puncher’ - DP-118 Combat Shotgun</b><br />As painful as it sounds, this high-end shotgun is more than enough to kick any ass presented to you. At close range, it’s a one shot kill affair.</li></ul><ul><li><b>The ‘Hard Candy’ HK-387L Rocket Launcher</b><br />The Hard Candy is a state of the art rocket launcher, capable of blowing the living shit out of any armored target. Of course, it’s even more fun to try on an unarmored target. I hope you like Sloppy Joes!</li></ul><ul><li><b>The ‘Pinpointer’ - BSW-72 ESR Enhanced Sniper</b><br />This classic sniper rifle couples the ultimate in armor-piercing rounds with a projectile velocity powerful enough to rip right through the sternum of any Promise Hand soldier. Tasty.</li></ul><ul><li><b>‘Spring Cleaner’ SK3 Fragmentation Grenades</b><br />Despite their sweety-pie nickname, these grenades are as tough as they come. Based on the classic dead man’s switch design, these time-operated babies are perfect for crowd clearance.</li></ul><h3>Promise Hand Weapons</h3><ul><li><b>The ‘Razor Tongue’</b><br />This classic hunting <a href="/knife/3055-295/" data-ref-id="3055-295">knife</a> can be used to slash or throw. The rebels can even smear the blade in Nectar by selecting it before making a Nectar Grenade. With Nectar on the blade, the Razor Tongue will cause any Mantel trooper to Overdose.</li></ul><ul><li><b>The ‘Lobo’ (Wolf)</b><br />The Lobo is the standard rifle for most militia groups across the world, and with good cause. With a quick-load double-ended magazine and a large clip size, it’s the ideal weapon for both attack and suppression.</li></ul><ul><li><b>The ‘Oso’ (Bear)</b>This shotgun may be a little rough round the edges, but it still packs a punch. With a slightly larger clips size than its mantel counterpart, the Oso’s extra cartridges can make all the difference in a close-quarters firefight.</li></ul><ul><li><b>The ‘Mano del Dios’ (Hand of God)</b><br />A massive bullet capacity and a surprisingly light weight makes this minigun the stuff of nightmares for anyone up against it. Not to be messed with.</li></ul><ul><li><b>The ‘Dragón de la Gente’ (The People’s Dragon)</b><br />A practical, portable flamethrower with a comparatively long reach, a few sweeps with this fiery weapon can be enough to clear a room in a matter of seconds.</li></ul><ul><li><b>The ‘Aguila’ (Eagle)</b><br />This sniper rifle carries fewer rounds than the Mantel equivalent, but what it lacks in number it makes up for in power. A deadly piece of hardware.</li></ul><ul><li><b>‘MalaFruta’ (BadFruit)</b><br />Old school, but that doesn’t mean they don’t hurt. Filled with a combination of steel chippings and high explosives, these grenades are just as dangerous as Mantel’s own.</li></ul><ul><li><b>‘Nectar Grenades’</b><br />Made on-the-fly by strapping a Nectar Administrator onto a standard grenade, this explosive spreads a thick cloud of yellow Nectar gas across the area. Any Mantel soldier stuck in the cloud will Overdose.</li></ul><h2>Vehicles</h2><p style="">Throughout <i>Haze</i>, you are able to drive/pilot many different vehicles.</p><h3>Mantel Vehicles</h3><ul><li><b>The ‘Boxcart’</b><br />Fast, maneuverable and all-terrain: a combination that has made the ‘Boxcart’ invaluable to Mantel troops in the difficult jungle landscape. Its lightweight frame is thanks to a notable absence of armor. So, whilst it can transport quickly, in combat it certainly can’t guarantee a safe arrival – hence its fragile namesake. Still, the fixed JM90 Heavy Gun turret is a good reason to get out of its way.</li></ul><ul><li><b>The ‘BigBoy'</b>At a mere 35 Tonnes, the ‘BigBoy’ tank is light in comparison to its ancestors even when fully loaded. This new low-weight version allows for fast-response tactical deployment and a reliably swift track speed. Its primary weapon - an electromagnetic coil cannon - functions like a rail gun, using magnetic forces along the barrel to propel its shells at a dangerously high velocity.</li></ul><ul><li><b>‘Mrs. Mantel’</b><br />Earning its alias by carrying soldiers in its ample belly and ‘birthing’ them on the battlefield, this dropship uses a combination of movable rotary engines and miniature kerosene afterburners, making it a true vertical take-off and landing craft. This motion arrangement gives the craft the means to both fly at high-speeds like a jet, but also to maneuver like a helicopter when at low speeds – thus, it is the perfect machine for rapid combat insertions.</li></ul><h3>Promise Hand Vehicles</h3><ul><li><b>The ‘Macho’ (Stag)</b><br />Like most rebel equipment, the ‘Stag’ is cleverly salvaged, constructed and repaired on-the-fly – resulting in a patchwork appearance. Subsequently, it is well modified for the harsh jungle environment.</li></ul><ul><li><b>The ‘Mula’ (Mule)</b><br />The ‘Mule’ is nothing if not ideal for jungle warfare – able to go where bulkier Mantel vehicles cannot reach, it is fast and versatile. The driver is virtually guaranteed a bumpy ride (hence its alias), but with the room for an additional passenger to fire in their defence, this vehicle is perfect for two-man smash ‘n’ grab missions.</li></ul><ul><li><b>The ‘Palo Hueco’ (The Hollow Bat)</b><br />This helicopter has a small advantage in manoeuvrability over Mantel’s ‘Mama’, thanks to its marginally smaller size and weight. Naturally, its armor is a pale comparison to its Mantel counterpart, but its mounted miniguns ensure it is deadly to ground forces.</li></ul><ul><li><b>The ‘Diente de la Serpiente’ (The Serpent’s Tooth)</b><br />This mobile missile launcher carries a rare second-generation nuclear missile, modified for a direct attack on the Mantel ‘Land Carrier’. The launcher itself is over 26 meters long, and is driven by two 1,800hp diesel engines with a maximum speed of just 20mph.</li></ul><h2>Poor Sales and Reception</h2><p style="">Upon release<i>, Haze</i> received mostly mediocre to low review scores. A notable exception to this was Famitsu which gave the game a rating of 34 out of 40. The game was criticized for a poor story, annoying exposition methods and characters, unimpressive graphics, a low number of multiplayer modes, and AI that was prone to glitching out in both the campaign and deathmatch games- and was still terrible when it wasn't. Some elements received a more neutral response, such as the feel of some of the game's weapons and some elements of the multiplayer.</p><p style=""><i>Haze</i> was one of the few third-party exclusive titles released on the Playstation 3 in 2008. Its sales did not meet expectations, selling less than 500,000 copies that year. This is widely considered to be a major factor in the closure of Free Radical, which took place on December 18, 2008.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>20455</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/2126444-box_haze.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/2126444-box_haze.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/2126444-box_haze.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/2126444-box_haze.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/2126444-box_haze.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2126444-box_haze.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/2126444-box_haze.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Haze]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>13</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-16/]]></api_detail_url><id>16</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: M]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-12/]]></api_detail_url><id>12</id><name><![CDATA[OFLC: MA15+]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-32/]]></api_detail_url><id>32</id><name><![CDATA[CERO: D]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-37/]]></api_detail_url><id>37</id><name><![CDATA[PEGI: 18+]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2008-05-20 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/haze/3030-20455/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[SFIV

Its popularity has sparked renewed interest in the genre, clearing the way for many other successful fighters.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Street Fighter IV, first released in 2009 in arcades, with numerous ports to home and portable consoles, is the first entry in <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/capcom/3010-367/" data-ref-id="3010-367">Capcom's</a> <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/street-fighter/3025-331/" data-ref-id="3025-331">classic fighting game franchise</a> developed for the <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/" data-ref-id="3045-20">Xbox 360</a> and <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/" data-ref-id="3045-35">PlayStation 3</a>. The game brings back the full cast of fighters from <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/street-fighter-ii/3025-1795/" data-ref-id="3025-1795">Street Fighter II</a>, in addition to fighters from the <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/street-fighter-alpha/3025-960/" data-ref-id="3025-960">Street Fighter Alpha</a> series. The story is set between the events of Street Fighter II and<a href="/street-fighter-iii-new-generation/3030-21948/" data-ref-id="3030-21948"> Street Fighter III</a>.</p><p style="">One of Street Fighter IV's most noticeable features is its new visual style. The game utilizes 3D animation while maintaining the 2D gameplay that has become the series' staple. The art style is inspired by East Asian calligraphy, with characters and backgrounds rendered in 3D. This is a major departure from the 2D sprites used in previous games in the franchise.</p><h2>Gameplay and Mechanics</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/882010-seth_004.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-882010" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/882010-seth_004.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-882010"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/882010-seth_004.jpg"></a><figcaption>Seth gives M.Bison a beating</figcaption></figure><p style="">The basic gameplay mechanics are modeled after Street Fighter II, but add some new features as well. For instance, SFIV includes mechanics from previous Street Fighter titles, such as 2-Button throwing, EX Supers, and a variant on Parrying (called Focus Attacks in this game). Additionally, the execution of moves is more lenient than past titles, making the game more accessible to newcomers and casual players. Street Fighter IV uses a 6-button layout that has been the series' standard since Street Fighter II. There are three punch and three kick buttons of varying strength (Light, Medium, and Hard).</p><p style="">One of the brand new mechanics in Street Fighter IV is the Focus Attack (called Saving Attack in Japan). A Focus Attack is a ground-based normal attack, executed by pressing medium kick and punch simultaneously; the Focus Attack has a number of uses and attributes.</p><p style="">Charging a Focus Attack grants "Hyper Armor" which allows a hit to be absorbed. It can also be canceled by Dashing forward or backward to extend combos or escape safely. There are three different levels of the Focus Attack. Level one is used by pressing and quickly releasing the two buttons; level two is activated by holding the buttons for a brief moment (identified by the character quickly glowing white); and the final level is activated by holding both buttons until the full attack is finished. Level two and three Focus Attacks will leave the opponent in a crumpled state, granting the attacker a chance for a free hit or a combo.

His power and nomadic way of life are a big draw to admiring challengers. He seeks the path of the "true warrior", but his pursuit of this lofty goal has set him squarely in the sights of evil organizations who would seek the same for their own ends."</i><br />Ryu is the definition of the lone-wolf <b>street</b> <b>fighter</b>. His stern determination to become a master of his fighting style has inspired many fellow martial artists. His training is his life and he will do whatever it takes to perfect his technique. When Ryu was a boy, a master martial artist named Gouken adopted him. The young boy grew under Gouken’s care, learning his unnamed fighting techniques with his best friend and fellow student, Ken Masters. Once Ryu turned 23, Gouken deemed him ready to leave the dojo and test his skills against the best fighters in the world in the first World Warrior Tournament. Ryu won, but the championship fight with Sagat, the Emperor of Muay Thai, was brutal and a dark power known as the Satsui no Hadou was released. Though he was victorious, Ryu was still troubled by the experience, becoming unsure about his fighting abilities. It was only after Ken encouraged him to improve that Ryu began to understand that there was still much he had to learn about himself and his fighting style. The Satsui no Hadou, or Surge of Murderous Intent, was similar to M. Bison’s Psycho Power and Ryu tried to avoid using it at all costs in order to keep true to his sensei’s peaceful teachings. But there were those who wished to use Ryu and harness the power of the Satsui no Hadou for themselves, including the CEO of S.I.N. (and head of the new tournament), Seth.</li><li><a href="/ken-masters/3005-212/" data-ref-id="3005-212"> Ken</a><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/698424-125.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-698424" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.56008359456635" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/698424-125.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-698424"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/669/698424-125.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/669/698424-125.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ken</figcaption></figure><br /><i>"Scion of the American financial group that bears his name, Ken Masters is also the closest friend and rival of Ryu.

He uses his Psycho Power to strike fear into the hearts of those who oppose him and further his own twisted and vile machinations.

From drug rings to human experiments and weapon sales, M. Bison was once the ruler of the underworld and his Psycho Power could not be stopped. With his supposed demise at the end of the second World Warrior Tournament and the fall of Shadaloo, many believed that was the last they’d see of Bison. How wrong they were. Bison has returned with a new body constructed by Shadaloo scientists, and this time the body is strong enough to withstand the full power of his Psycho Power. The dark warlord emerges once again, ready to reclaim his rightful place at the head of Shadaloo and return it to its former terrifying glory.</li></ul><ul><li><a href="/akuma/3005-433/" data-ref-id="3005-433"> Akuma</a> (Hidden, playable in console version, playable in the arcade version as of September 2008) <figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4387/560950-akuma.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-560950" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.56275303643725" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4387/560950-akuma.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-560950"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4387/560950-akuma.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4387/560950-akuma.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Akuma</figcaption></figure><br /><i>"This demonic warrior discarded his own humanity when he let the dark power of the Satsui no Hado take over and murder his own brother Gouken in cold blood.

She relies on her mastery of Soul Power, an energy that draws its source from her very life-force, rather than on physical technique to vanquish foes." <br /></i>Rose, a fortuneteller from Genoa, was once Bison’s soul mate, literally. After facing Bison for the first time, she discovered the two shared the same soul, his corrupt and her’s pure. The demented warlord briefly possessed the mystic before he moved to another body. Rose cannot remember what happened while Bison controlled her, but knows he is still out there no matter what others may say. She embraces her mysterious Soul Power, the one weapon Bison cannot command, and uses it to wield her golden scarf against the wrongs of the world.

This was done in direct correlation to the feedback of the community. The dedication of Ono’s Team really shined through at the last minute, as the entire game was retooled with 2D hit-box collision detection on all characters, just in time for release. To much acclaim, the game now feels like a Street Fighter game again.</p><p style="">One example of how the old 3D polygonal collision detection system effected gameplay, was that if Ryu jumped onto Dhalsim’s extended arms he would get hit and take damage. With the new 2D detection system, now Ryu passes-through Dhalsim’s arms and only takes damage from his fists. Many other things were said to just feel "off" about 3D polygonal collision detection, but is now all fixed with 2D hit-boxes.</p><p style="">Here is a quote from Yoshinori Ono about the state of the game, just a month before going gold:</p><p style="">"It was a really difficult process of changing the collision detection entirely, as you may imagine. Basically, we had this much of a time period to make the game, and right as we were just a month or two out, we suddenly had a change in direction. We felt, "We have to change this. We have to fix this game and get it to feel right or else nothing else we’re doing is going to be worth it."</p><p style="">So basically it was a matter of buttering up the team and begging them to stay really late. I would bring them buckets of fried chicken and candy and stuff to keep them working. In the end I think it all turned out fine and it feels a lot better than it did before.</p><p style="">Speaking specifically of what we did... we changed it to the old-school 2D collision box, [instead of 3D], so it feels a lot closer than it used to. Using the 3D collision detection, some things didn’t work as well. Some of the punches didn’t work right when they connected, but we fixed all that."</p><h2>Official controller and arcade stick</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9170/656387-2853046422_da3e47363c.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-656387" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9170/656387-2853046422_da3e47363c.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-656387"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9170/656387-2853046422_da3e47363c.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9170/656387-2853046422_da3e47363c.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The original Tournament Edition FightStick.</figcaption></figure><p style="">In August 2008, Mad Catz announced that they would be developing the official controller and arcade stick for the console version of Street Fighter IV. There were to be for PS3 and Xbox 360/PC. They where unveiled at the GameStop Expo 2008, and it was announced that the stick's would be easily customized without soldering. These arcade sticks came out with the game's release in February, 17 2009. There are two variations of the sticks with the standard edition costing $70 dollars and the tournament edition (the one pictured on the right) costs $150.</p><p style="">The Tournament Edition Fight Stick uses official Sanwa buttons and joysticks and it is also bigger in size compared to the normal Fight Stick, which has generic buttons and joysticks. Since there was a limited run of TE Sticks at the game's launch, they are rare to find other than on places such as eBay. Because of this Mad Catz released a Round 2 version of the stick, which was black instead of white, and had a different face plate.</p><p style=""> </p><p style="">The FightPads released included artwork from Akuma, Ken, Ryu, Chun-Li and Blanka. The PS3 version is wireless, while the 360 version is wired.</p><p style=""> </p><p style=""> </p><p style="">Limited edition sticks are also being unveiled at Convention through out the year, including:</p><p style=""> </p><p style=""><b>PAX 2009 "Femme Fatale" Limited Edition </b></p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5310/1380515-sf4fightstick1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1380515" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.65" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:65.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5310/1380515-sf4fightstick1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1380515"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5310/1380515-sf4fightstick1.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5310/1380515-sf4fightstick1.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style=""> </p><p style=""><b>2009 San Diego Comic Con </b></p><p style="">Limited Edition</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5310/1532300-images.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-1532300" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.59450171821306" data-width="291" style="width: 291px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:59.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5310/1532300-images.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-1532300"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5310/1532300-images.jpeg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5310/1532300-images.jpeg"></noscript></a></figure><p style=""> </p><h2>Collector's Edition</h2><p style="">PlayStation 3 version includes:</p><ul><li>Ryu Action Figurine</li><li>CD Soundtrack</li><li>"<b>Street</b> <b>Fighter</b> <b>IV</b>: The Ties That Bind" Blu-ray Movie Disc</li><li>Collector's Hint Book</li><li><b>Street</b> <b>Fighter</b> <b>IV</b> Game Disc</li><li>PlayStation Network Voucher for 5 Alternate Costumes (Brawler Pack)</li></ul><p style="">Xbox 360 version includes:</p><ul><li>C.Viper Action Figurine</li><li>CD Soundtrack</li><li>"Street Fighter IV: The Ties That Bind" DVD Game Disc (only playable on an Xbox 360)</li><li>Collector's Hint Book</li><li>Street Fighter IV Game Disc</li><li>Xbox Live Marketplace Voucher for 5 Alternate Costumes (Brawler Pack)</li></ul><p style="">Both versions that were released in the PAL region didn't include the CD Soundtrack but did have both Ryu and C.

style="">Free download-able content was also added in the way of Championship Mode, a tournament style network-play mode, where top ranking players will get their data uploaded to Capcom's servers and then it will be freely made available to the public. A Replay mode was also added to the update where, just as the name suggests, you will be able to watch and upload replay data and watch top ranked players as well. You will be able to vote for your favorite replays. Competitors in tournaments will earn GP or "Grade Points" to earn entry into tournaments.</p><p style="">The characters <a href="/dee-jay/3005-4154/" data-ref-id="3005-4154">Dee Jay</a> and <a href="/t-hawk/3005-46/" data-ref-id="3005-46">T.Hawk</a> were supposed to be in the game, they even had their models developed but they were omitted from the game for some reason. It was hinted that they might be implemented into the game in the future if they get enough support from the fans. It was unclear if via downloadable content or some other method. They are the only two characters that did not make it over from Super Street Fighter II. It was revealed that these characters will not be available as DLC and instead appear in SuperStreetFighter IV, an updated version of the game which was released on April 27th, 2010.</p><h2>Tier List</h2><p style="">Tier lists show how strong the characters can be evaluated relative to each other. Expected from the potential of a character, practically from that in the context of human potential, perfectly played character.</p><p style="">They come from a mixture of experience (how top players cut-it with characters, as well as from the big tournaments, etc.) and partly from a theoretical consideration. Tier lists give tendencies of potential outcomes, but are not absolute, i.e. if a character is one or two spots higher in the tier ranking than another character, when one considers the entire cast, usually benefit from more Matchups than the characters in the tier under him, but if compared directly with him only has a 5:5 or even worse matchup. Tiers can be traditionally divided in Top, Mid or Low, whereby if one wants to define it even more, in Mid Upper / Lower Mid split. Low, sometimes called the Garbage tier, usually comprises the "garbage" characters, i.e. those who have so many bad Matchups that in a tournament, that character has no real chance.</p><p style="">Top Tier Characters in the best case, have no or minimal bad Matchups. Upper Mid are usually characters who do have one or the other bad Matchup, but are still able to do well, even in direct comparison with the Top Tier Characters. Depending on how far or close the Tiers are together, this is often the line, where tournament able characters are drawn.</p><p style="">Occasionally there is also a so-called God Tier. These are usually characters from the top of the list and their worst possible Matchup are often only themselves, as they dominate everything else. One finds in this context sometimes referred to as God Semi Tier, which usually means that the character is still on the regular list of tier, but dominated from another tier God.</p><p style="">Tier classification is different today, displaying in more of a disposition of the Tier characters with Letter grades, since you can split them a much as you wish and add even more levels with and - that allows a flexible and more dynamic display of tiers. (where the S rank is usually the Top Tier, and the Tiers start at A).</p><p style="">It must be said that Tier lists always are a little spongy. Most Top tiers (or God tiers if there are any) and Low Tiers are normally clear, the rest in the middle are to a certain extent, debatable. Also of heavily changing tier lists, especially if the game is still new, because not all the tactics are discovered and exploited plus the full potential of every character isn't known.</p><p style=""> </p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p style="">This is the official soundtrack for the game, which also comes with collector's editions of the game.</p><p style=""><b> Disc 1</b></p><p style="">1.

The game originally only offered 8 characters (Ryu, Ken, Guile, Dhalsim, Blanka, Abel, Chun-Li and M. Bison) but Capcom is offering free updates that include character additions (Zangief, Cammy, C. Viper and E. Hondahave already been added).</p><p style=""> </p><p style="">The game offers simplified controls. There are 4 buttons on screen: Punch, Kick, Focus and Special. Since there are no Jab, Strong and Fierce options on screen, the player can only control the strength of their punches and kicks by holding different directional button while taping the respective attack. The "Special" button acts as a shortcut for Special moves. Instead of inputting quarter-circle forward, punch for Ryu's fireball, the player simply press Forward, Special to pull off the move. This makes it a little easier to deal with inputs on what is, essentially, a digital D-pad. <a href="/ultra-combo/3015-6150/" data-ref-id="3015-6150">Ultras</a> and <a href="/super-combo/3015-6149/" data-ref-id="3015-6149">Supers</a> can also be executed by simply tapping on the meter/ icon for the respective move.</p><p style=""> </p><p style="">Modes include:</p><ul><li>"Tournament" mode</li><li>"Dojo" mode</li><li>A challenge mode where players can complete various requirements and be given a letter grade upon completion</li><li>Online versus mode</li></ul><p style=""> </p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>20456</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/1832164-box_sf4.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/1832164-box_sf4.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/1832164-box_sf4.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/1832164-box_sf4.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/1832164-box_sf4.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1832164-box_sf4.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/1832164-box_sf4.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Street Fighter IV]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>77</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-1/]]></api_detail_url><id>1</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: T]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-33/]]></api_detail_url><id>33</id><name><![CDATA[CERO: B]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-36/]]></api_detail_url><id>36</id><name><![CDATA[PEGI: 12+]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-38/]]></api_detail_url><id>38</id><name><![CDATA[OFLC: PG]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2008-07-18 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-84/]]></api_detail_url><id>84</id><name><![CDATA[Arcade]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/arcade/3045-84/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[ARC]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/street-fighter-iv/3030-20456/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[GTA4

The game follows <a href="../../niko-bellic/94-154/" rel="nofollow">Niko Bellic</a>'s arrival to the United States, following the (laughably false) claims of wealth and luxury promised in letters from his cousin, <a href="/roman-bellic/3005-105/" data-ref-id="3005-105">Roman</a>. As he begins to deal with the culture shock of living in a very capitalist <a href="../../liberty-city/95-15/" rel="nofollow">Liberty City</a>, Niko also attempts to make good on his secret vendetta—to find a “ special someone” who betrayed him (and others) during the war. As he continues his hunt, Niko encounters, works with, and occasionally befriends a wide variety of unsavory characters from all walks of life, offering his services to them as a gun for hire.</p><p style="">The game was built on <a href="../../rage-rockstar-advanced-game-engine/92-1669/" rel="nofollow">RAGE</a>, an engine that <a href="../../rockstar-games/65-1194/" rel="nofollow">Rockstar</a> developed, first used in <a href="../../rockstar-games-presents-table-tennis/61-16770/" rel="nofollow">Rockstar's Table Tennis</a>, circa 2006. There was a special edition of GTA <b>IV</b>, containing a duffel bag, soundtrack sampler, art book, and a copy of the game, all packaged in a locked metal case made to look like a safety-deposit box. There were many conflicts in the game that surfaced and many unanswered questions, such as what will Niko encounter later in life?</p><h2>Plot</h2><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39162/1707823-nikobellic_gtaiv.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1707823" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="1.2828685258964" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:128.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39162/1707823-nikobellic_gtaiv.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1707823"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/39162/1707823-nikobellic_gtaiv.jpg"></a><figcaption>Niko Bellic</figcaption></figure><p style="">Niko Bellic is a former Yugoslavian immigrant (though never specified, in <i>The Cousins Bellic,</i> Roman remarks that Niko's English is better than his [Roman's] Serbian, implying that the cousins are, in fact, from <a href="/serbia/3035-717/" data-ref-id="3035-717">Serbia</a>.) trying to make his way through his difficult life. A war veteran having fought in the Bosnian conflict of the early 1990s, he admits to tragic events occurring such as, through conversations with friends, the death of his brother and Roman’s mother. After the war, Niko couldn’t find any work in what was now a war-torn country, and began a life of crime, eventually landing him in the pocket of <a href="../../rodislav-bulgarin/94-1664/" rel="nofollow">Rodislav Bulgarin</a>; a Russian mobster in charge of the Mediterranean immigrant smuggling business.</p><p style="">After working some time for Bulgarin, a ship that Niko was aboard sank a few miles off the Italian coastline. Barely surviving the swim, Bulgarin believed that Niko intentionally sunk it in order to escape with the money. Niko realized this to be what Bulgarin thought, and had no choice but to avert the Russian Mafia. He spent seven months upon the merchant navy ship, The Platypus, contemplating joining his cousin, Roman, in his lavish and luxurious American life.</p><p style="">When The Platypus pulls into the City, Niko disembarks and is soon after picked up by his cousin to drive back to Roman’s place. When they get back, however, Niko is quick to observe that all Roman had told him was a great exaggeration, and in reality Roman had nothing but a poor apartment and small cab company. Roman’s gambling addiction landed him in debt to loan shark <a href="../../vlad-glebov/94-1015/" rel="nofollow">Vlad</a>. Roman has a girlfriend called Mallorie, who introduces Niko to <a href="../../michelle/94-4751/" rel="nofollow">Michelle</a> and who Roman suspects to be sleeping with Vlad. When Niko finds out that Roman had been correct, he contemplates for a moment with Roman, and then decides to exact revenge, to Roman’s great surprise. Niko and Roman get into a car and chase Vlad to the Pier. Vlad tries to justify his existence, and tells Niko that if he shoots, people will find him. Niko kills Vlad and dumps his body into the water. A few hours later, Roman calls him, and, in a hushed tone, tells him where to rendezvous. Niko finds Roman hiding in a dumpster, where Roman speaks of gangsters chasing him. Niko is in disbelief before he’s knocked out with the butt of a rifle.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3419/838167-3_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-838167" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3419/838167-3_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-838167"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3419/838167-3_1.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3419/838167-3_1.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Niko brandishing a shotgun</figcaption></figure><p style="">Waking up in the basement of <a href="../../mikhail-faustin/94-1023/" rel="nofollow">Mikhail Faustin</a>'s house, Niko is questioned by the captor as well as Faustin’s partner in crime, <a href="../../dimitri-rascalov/94-941/" rel="nofollow">Dimitri Rascalov</a>, until Faustin himself comes down to tell them to keep their voices low, when he discovers his goon to be incorrectly interrogating Niko, and consequently shoots him. Roman begins to lose his cool and Faustin decides to shoot him too, but only in the stomach. Dimitri calms down Faustin, who tells Niko to complete a task; with Dimitri promising to heal Roman’s wound. Niko works under Faustin and Dimitri for a while, as they gradually drift apart, and Dimitri finally asks Niko to kill Faustin. Niko chases Faustin through his club until a final confrontation on the roof. Faustin claims that has made Dimitri greedy and that he will betray Niko as well. Niko pays no heed and kills him. Afterwards Dimitri requests Niko meet him at a warehouse to receive his payment.</p><p style=""><a href="../../little-jacob/94-189/" rel="nofollow">Little Jacob</a>, a drug dealer Niko had worked with earlier in the game, calls immediately after Niko’s conversation with Dimitri, telling him he has a bad feeling about the whole shindig and will be at his side during the meet. Once Niko makes his way into the warehouse, he finds Dimitri’s new partner to be Rodislav Bulgarin. Niko realizes that the meet was a trap, and duels with Dimitri’s henchmen in the warehouse with the assistance of Little Jacob. Niko frees Roman from the back of a car some time later and drives them both to Roman’s cab company, only to find it burning violently, along with his apartment. Roman is devastated, and after crying to Niko (the “mission” is called Roman’s Sorrow) he rings up Mallorie and asks her to find them a place in Bohan. Roman then concludes the mission by revealing to Niko that the “special item” he had referred to when Niko rescued him was an engagement ring. It had burned, lying in his apartment.</p><p style="">The two of them take shelter in Bohan, where Niko finds he can be of some service to the locals, at first only <a href="../../manny-escuela/94-1022/" rel="nofollow">Manny Escuela</a> and <a href="../../elizabeta-torres/94-696/" rel="nofollow">Elizabeta Torres</a>, Elizabeta introduces Niko to <a href="../../playboy-x/94-137/" rel="nofollow">Playboy X</a> and <a href="../../packie-mcreary/94-439/" rel="nofollow">Patrick McReary</a>. Working under Playboy X, Niko discovers that Playboy’s mentor, <a href="../../dwayne-forge/94-703/" rel="nofollow">Dwayne Forge</a>, has been recently released from prison. Playboy asks Niko to meet with Dwayne, who Niko greatly sympathizes with. Niko starts accepting missions from Dwayne as well, without pay, until Dwayne asks him to kill the managers at a strip club. Niko does as instructed, but soon after finds out that Playboy owned that strip club. Playboy, furious, asks Niko to take out Dwayne. Niko contemplates, and, depending on the player’s decision, kills one of them. Meanwhile, Roman rebuilds the cab company, with the assistance of his insurance company, who think that the original company burned down because of an electrical fire. He rediscovers his passion for gambling, which lands him, once again, in the pocket of Russian loan sharks. In <a href="../../algonquin/95-2010/" rel="nofollow">Algonquin</a>, Niko befriends Patrick McReary, who he’d worked with earlier, upon Elizabeta’s command. Patrick and Niko become friends and soon Niko gets to know the McReary family and circle of trust, which includes <a href="../../derrick-mcreary/94-4173/" rel="nofollow">Derrick McReary</a>, <a href="../../francis-mcreary/94-1035/" rel="nofollow">Francis McReary</a>, <a href="../../gerry-mcreary/94-4236/" rel="nofollow">Gerry McReary</a> and last but not least, <a href="../../kate-mcreary/94-438/" rel="nofollow">Kate McReary</a>. After the introductions and a few missions, Niko gets a call from a terrified Elizabeta. He goes to her house, where she tells him that the cops are onto her. She inadvertently kills Manny Escuela, and then sends to Niko to do a drug deal with Little Jacob, only to find out that the person who intercepts Niko’s deal is none other than Michelle, his girl friend. Niko doesn’t mince words with her, but soon after surrenders and discovers that she works for a secret government organization called United Liberty Paper. Her role in the game is concluded when she hands Niko over to the unnamed man leading U. L. Paper, who bribes Niko with the information he has on his criminal activities. Niko agrees to do dirty work for the government, as long as they help him find a “special someone”.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5150/907163-gta4characters_jimmypegorino.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-907163" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.71777777777778" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:71.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5150/907163-gta4characters_jimmypegorino.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-907163"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5150/907163-gta4characters_jimmypegorino.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5150/907163-gta4characters_jimmypegorino.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Jimmy Pegorino</figcaption></figure><p style="">Patrick McReary’s family leads him to the Italian mobsters <a href="../../ray-boccino/94-3546/" rel="nofollow">Ray Boccino</a> and <a href="../../phil-bell/94-1037/" rel="nofollow">Phil Bell</a>, who soon after introduce him to <a href="../../jimmy-pegorino/94-1030/" rel="nofollow">Jimmy Pegorino</a>. Working under their wing and helping the McReary’s, Niko finally gets a lead from Ray: Ray tells him the whereabouts of Florian Cravic. Niko, with Roman, busts through Florian’s apartment, gun in hand, only to find a much calmer man, now named Bernie, who moved to safely pursue his homosexuality. He dispels Niko’s idea that Florian, or Bernie, was the one who sold out their unit, and tells him that all this time he had thought Niko to be the one. Frustrated and disappointed, Niko leaves with no resolve. He ceases working for Ray and finds closure with the all but one of the McReary’s, Kate, with whom he has an ongoing relationship. U. L. Paper had Niko working with Jon Gravelli, an old mobster about to hit the bucket, who eventually gives Niko the one person he is sure sold out their platoon: Darko Brevich. Niko informs Roman that he’s found Darko, and Roman decides to meet the old friend as well, Niko and Roman head off to the Airport, As they enter the Airport a truckfull of government soldiers circle around the backlot and drops off a miserable looking man who is bound by ropes. Niko confronts him, and when Darko asks who Niko is, he replies only with, “I’m the one who survived.” Darko then proceeds to justify his actions, telling Niko that their unit had killed some of his friends, some of his family. Still furious, Niko asks him how much they payed him. Darko laughs and replies, “A thousand. How much do they pay you to kill someone?” Niko is suddenly thrown into contemplation when Darko contrasts the two of them, but then Darko pleas for him to end his life, telling Niko that he’d be doing him a favor. The player gets to decide whether or not Niko kills Darko. If he does, right before Darko bleeds out, he thanks Niko for ending his life. Niko eventually regrets this decision. If Niko decides to let Darko live, both Bernie and Roman congratulate him for finally burying his past.</p><p style="">Niko, still suffering from the shock of his confrontation with Brevich, tries to cool off at a bar. There, he finds Jimmy P, whose empire is falling apart and needs Niko to do him one last solid: Work with Dimitri Rascalov. Niko is at first morally resistant to the idea, but Pegorino persists, and the player is given the ultimate ethical decision: either you sell your soul to the devil, or you become him. The outcome is detailed in the next section.</p><h2>Multiple Endings</h2><p style="">After Niko’s conversation with Pegorino, you have to drive around for a while before Niko is called by Kate McReary and Roman. Niko isn’t very specific with Kate, he only tells her that a decision came up, and that he can either earn money or make good on something he promised to do. Kate, given this extremely abstract version of the actual situation, adheres to her moral code and tells Niko to do so, as well. Roman, however, believes that Niko should go through with the deal, not only because Roman prefers money to violence, but because he’d like the money for his honeymoon with soon-to-be bride Mallorie, as well as help him earn the money he needs to live the life he always wanted to with his cousin.</p><h3>Seeking Revenge</h3><p style="">If you choose to extract revenge, you will find Dimitri on The Platypus, the very same ship you were on when you arrived in Liberty City. After fighting through Dimitri’s men, you must pull a lever and get to the bottom of the ship, where you confront Dimitri alongside his henchmen. Shortly after Niko kills Dimitri, he attends Roman’s wedding, where he is ambushed by Pegorino and his goons as they drive by. Everyone successfully evades the attempted murder except for Kate, who is shot dead. Niko is deeply disturbed by her death, when Roman and Jacob tell him to get going and take a nap.</p><p style="">When Niko wakes up, he gets a call from Little Jacob, who, alongside Roman, has decided to take down Pegorino and whatever’s left of his empire. All three of them chase a car full of his goons to Pegorino’s hideout. Niko slides out of the car and tells Roman and Jacob that the most useful thing they can do is ensure that they don’t die, and maybe figure out an exit strategy. There is a great struggle and Niko finally makes it inside and to the top of the building, where he encounters Pegorino, who slides down a ladder and escapes via boat. Niko chases him down and gets into Jacob’s chopper and continues his pursuit. Both Pegorino and Niko crash, wherein Niko chases Pegorino alone and eventually kills him, but not before delivering a <b>grand</b> monologue.</p><h3>Taking the Deal</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/23298/971503-nikobellic61.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-971503" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.6605504587156" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:66.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/23298/971503-nikobellic61.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-971503"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/23298/971503-nikobellic61.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/23298/971503-nikobellic61.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Living the dream.</figcaption></figure><p style="">If you choose to make the deal, you are sent in alongside Phil Bell to rendezvous with Dimitri's men. Dimitri betrays Niko, who has to fight his way out of the compound with Phil and $250,000. When Niko heads back, he tells Kate that he decided to do the job for the money, for which she is furious at him and refuses to go to his cousin’s wedding. He goes without her, and after the usual proceedings, one of Dimitri’s men opens fire on the crowd. Roman is shot down and killed, for which Niko is very angry. He hits the goon’s dead body a few times before going home at the will of Jacob. When he wakes up, he decides to kill Dimitri. You again follow Pegorino’s goons to the building where Pegorino and Dimitri set up shop. Niko tells Jacob that he’ll handle it alone, and after a great conflict, he finally makes it inside, where he sees Dimitri betray Pegorino and then attempt to escape, this time via helicopter. The rest is essentially the same, in that you follow Dimitri via helicopter until both of your vehicles crash. You track down Dimitri and kill him, the game ending with a shot of the Statue of Happiness.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><p style="">The GTA series had always had a variety of weapons to use.

Prove your dominance behind the wheel.</td></tr><tr><td><b>GTA Race</b></td><td>GTA Race is a standard race, customized. Instead of starting off in a car, players must find a vehicle to drive, and are able to shoot one another to increase their chances of winning. Playing dirty has never been so justified.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Mafiya Work</b></td><td>You're working for mobster Kenny Petrovic. When Kenny asks you to do something, you do it.

And the robbers weren't forced off the road in stolen sports cars. Crooks aim to get their boss to a safe point, while the cops try to ensure their boss winds up dead before he ever gets there.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Turf War</b></td><td>Turf War is effectively a conquest mode. Fight for the points and capture them within a given amount of time. The team holding the most points when time runs out are victorious.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Hangman's N.O.O.S.E</b></td><td>The SWAT team are aware of Kenny Petrovic's arrival at Francis International Airport. It is up to you and your team to ensure that the 'boss' isn't arrested before he reaches his safehouse.

Microsoft was rumored to have paid 50 million dollars to keep the DLC exclusive to the Xbox 360 version of the game, although this sum was never confirmed. Despite Rockstar's promise, as 2008 dragged on, the DLC was delayed to an unspecified date in 2009. On November 19th, 2008, USA Today revealed the details on the first downloadable content package, The Lost and Damned. This episode was also released for PS3 on April 13th, 2010.</p><h2>The Lost and Damned</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/46067/1066797-boxart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1066797" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="1.1060606060606" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:110.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/46067/1066797-boxart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1066797"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/46067/1066797-boxart.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/46067/1066797-boxart.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>GTA: The Lost and Damned</figcaption></figure><p style="">The first piece of downloadable package for <b>Grand</b> <b>Theft</b> <b>Auto</b> 4 is titled "The Lost and Damned" and was released on February 17th for the Xbox 360 exclusively; it cost 1,600 Microsoft Points and was 1.78gb in size.</p><p style="">The package contains new missions, side missions, music and weapons; giving players between 10 and 20 hours of new gameplay. Although Niko Bellic appears in the DLC he is not the playable character; the player instead assumes the role of a very minor character from the main storyline, a biker named <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/johnny-klebitz/3005-8702/" data-ref-id="3005-8702">Johnny Klebitz</a>. He's a member of the Liberty City biker gang "<a href="//www.giantbomb.com/lost-mc/3015-2840/" data-ref-id="3015-2840">The Lost</a>" (the same gang Niko meets in the main game). Dan Houser, Vice President of Creative Development for Rockstar Games, has stated that the episode shows a different side of Liberty City, and will answer many mysteries from the main story. Even though players encounter "The Lost" biker gang several times throughout the main game as Niko, the story for "The Lost and Damned" will not be directly impacted by decisions you made in the main game.</p><p style="">The story is mainly set in areas which were rarely visited whilst playing as Niko. <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/billy-grey/3005-9594/" data-ref-id="3005-9594">Billy Grey</a>, the Lost leader, has been released from jail and starts to wreak havoc on the ' <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/angels-of-death/3015-2845/" data-ref-id="3015-2845">Angels of Death</a>', a rival gang, which breaks the truce between the two gangs. The player takes the role of Johnny Klebitz, the vice-president of the Lost, who temporarily took over role as Leader of the gang whilst Billy Grey was in jail. Johnny tries to stay calm as Billy breaks the truces set up by Johnny, but how long will he last knowing the gang could be falling apart?</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3316/837717-gtadlc8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-837717" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3316/837717-gtadlc8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-837717"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3316/837717-gtadlc8.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3316/837717-gtadlc8.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Johnny Klebitz and Billy Grey</figcaption></figure><p style="">The Lost and Damned has new weapons, such as the grenade launcher, pipe bomb, and sawn-off and automatic shotguns. The lighting has been reworked to appear more dramatic, and character models have been slightly improved. There are also new vehicles, such as Johnny's bike, which has been made easier to control than other motorbikes, as the player spends a lot of time riding it in the DLC. There is a safe house where Johnny can interact with his other brothers in the Lost, and try new minigames such as arm wrestling and card games, joining old favorites like pool. There are plenty of missions where Johnny rides out as part of a pack of the Lost in an organized formation with the leader in front, and his 'brothers' help him out in the tougher firefights. The player is encouraged to keep his brothers alive, and surviving members of the gang will receive a stats boost to their health, accuracy, and damage dealing after each mission. If a Lost member does die, he'll be replaced with a new brother with set-to-zero stats. Simply put, the longer they stay breathing, the more help they'll be. And the attempts to make the player feel like a member of a real biker gang don't stop there. When riding with the gang, a Lost logo will appear on the road to indicate where to ride in order to stay in formation. If the logo is properly followed, the player will be rewarded with dialogue with his brothers, as well as a small personal health boost and a vehicle health boost.</p><p style="">The Lost and Damned also includes new multiplayer modes. Some can simply be considered rehashes with motorbikes of older modes, while others are more noticeably different, like Chopper vs. Chopper, where one player runs through checkpoints in the city on a motorcycle while the other chases in a gun-toting helicopter. There is also a new revamped race mode where competing bikers are armed with clubs and take each other out in brutal fashion.</p><h2>New Weapons in The Lost and Damned</h2><table><tbody><tr><th>Thrown Weapons</th></tr><tr><td><h3>Pipebomb</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14440/1328148-wep_pipebomb.gif" data-ref-id="1300-1328148" data-size="small" style="width: 95px" data-ratio="0.34736842105263" data-width="95" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:34.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14440/1328148-wep_pipebomb.gif" data-ref-id="1300-1328148"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14440/1328148-wep_pipebomb.gif" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14440/1328148-wep_pipebomb.gif"></noscript></a></figure><br />The <a href="../../pipe-bomb/93-1806/" rel="nofollow">pipe bomb</a> is a crude homemade device that creates a large explosion.

The Ballad of Gay Tony tells the story of Luis Lopez.</p><p style="">Lopez had been the expected next protagonist, as he is the third major character in the GTA IV mission Impossible Trinity. Lopez is an assistant to the nightclub impresario Tony Prince (Gay Tony), who made a number of appearances in GTA <b>IV</b>. This installment of DLC focuses on the nightlife of <a href="/">Liberty City</a> and makes use of many of the already present, but not interactive, night clubs and luxury spots throughout <a href="/">Algonquin</a>. The episode contains new cars, new aircraft, and new weapons, including a new helicopter with mounted guns. It also brings back the parachute item, as seen in GTA San Andreas. Players can base jump from numerous tall buildings and locations around the open world map.</p><p style="">The Ballad of Gay Tony was released as a download and at retail as part of <a href="/"><b>Grand</b> <b>Theft</b> <b>Auto</b>: Episodes from Liberty City</a>, which does not contain the original GTA <b>IV</b> content, but does have stand-alone, playable versions of The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony. This disc retailed for 39.99 USD at launch. This content, as well as the disc, was released on October 29th, 2009. The disc version and downloadable version were both released for PS3 on April13th, 2010.</p><h2>New Weapons in The Ballad of Gay Tony</h2><table><tbody><tr><th>Thrown Weapons</th></tr><tr><td><h3>Sticky Bombs</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14440/1329816-weapons_stickybombs.png" data-ref-id="1300-1329816" data-size="small" style="width: 58px" data-ratio="1.051724137931" data-width="58" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:105.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14440/1329816-weapons_stickybombs.png" data-ref-id="1300-1329816"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14440/1329816-weapons_stickybombs.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14440/1329816-weapons_stickybombs.png"></noscript></a></figure><br /><a href="../../satchel-charge/93-1415/" rel="nofollow">Satchel Charges</a> can be used to tag vehicles or objects for remote detonation.</td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><th>Pistols</th></tr><tr><td><h3>Pistol .44</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14440/1329815-weapons_pistol44.png" data-ref-id="1300-1329815" data-size="small" style="width: 143px" data-ratio="0.51748251748252" data-width="143" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:51.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14440/1329815-weapons_pistol44.png" data-ref-id="1300-1329815"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14440/1329815-weapons_pistol44.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14440/1329815-weapons_pistol44.png"></noscript></a></figure><br />The AMT Automag Model 180 is a highly accurate handgun.</td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><th>Submachine Guns</th></tr><tr><td><h3>Assault SMG</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14440/1329814-weapons_p90.png" data-ref-id="1300-1329814" data-size="small" style="width: 222px" data-ratio="0.35585585585586" data-width="222" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:35.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14440/1329814-weapons_p90.png" data-ref-id="1300-1329814"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14440/1329814-weapons_p90.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14440/1329814-weapons_p90.png"></noscript></a></figure><br />The <a href="../../p90-smg/93-615/" rel="nofollow">P90</a> is a compact submachine gun; its lightweight design makes it ideal in urban environments.

Due to the later release date and greater processing capabilities, the PC version is improved from the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions. The graphics are improved as the game will run in 2560 x 1600 resolution, with higher-quality textures and increased draw distances. Another enhancement is the ability to adjust the traffic density. The multiplayer allows 32 players, twice the 16 players allowed on the console version.</p><h3>GTA <b>IV</b> PC Video Editor</h3><p style="">The new Video Editor feature allows players to capture in-game footage, make real-time edits, and export those clips as .WMV movie files. The clips can also be spliced together into a video with post effects like music, text, transitions, and other features found in video editing programs. Videos can then be shared for other players to view and rate using the Rockstar Games Social Club TV.</p><p style=""><b>Clip Capturing</b></p><p style="">At any time during the game (single or multiplayer), press the F2 key to dump the footage to the hard drive. Depending on how data intensive things are in the world at that time, the clip should be about 30 to 40 seconds long. Captured footage will be the action that occurs prior to pressing F2. This feature can be turned off to improve performance.</p><p style=""><b>Launching the Video Editor</b></p><p style="">To execute the Video Editor, call it up using the in-game cellphone. After a prompt which states that any unsaved data will be lost, a menu for viewing and editing clips opens, with the following choices:</p><ul><li>Clips</li><li>Editor</li><li>Gallery</li><li>Upload</li><li>Online</li></ul><p style="">All footage captured in the game can be viewed in the Clips section. There are the standard DVD style controls for video playback. The camera can be moved when the right mouse button is held down.</p><p style=""><b>Editor</b></p><p style="">The Editor allows users to name videos, string multiple clips together, and add music, titles, and transitions.</p><p style="">To quickly create a video to upload, make sure at least one clip is in the storyboard editing space and then hit the Web option in Export To Gallery.</p><p style=""><b>Gallery</b></p><p style="">The section labeled Gallery contains all of the completed, exported videos. The most recently exported video is displayed in the preview window, and the thumbnails on the right side of the screen are arranged with the newest videos appearing at the top.</p><p style=""><b>Upload</b></p><p style="">In the section labeled Upload, players can submit their web videos to the Social Club. The left side of the screen shows local videos that have created. The right side is a web portal displaying all the videos that have been uploaded.</p><p style=""><b>Online</b></p><p style="">The Online section will minimize <b>Grand</b> <b>Theft</b> <b>Auto</b> <b>IV</b> and go to the Rockstar Games Social Club TV website using the default web browser. There users can view, rate, and comment on clips others have uploaded.</p><h2>Physics</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11986/1834766-gta_iv_physics.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1834766" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11986/1834766-gta_iv_physics.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1834766"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11986/1834766-gta_iv_physics.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11986/1834766-gta_iv_physics.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Roadkill</figcaption></figure><p style="">GTA IV is the second game to be released with the middleware named "Euphoria". Euphoria gives character models muscles, joints, a motor nervous system, and environmental awareness. This means that characters are capable of protecting themselves from injury by doing things such as grabbing on to a hand rail as they are falling down a staircase, or covering their face using their arms. GTA <b>IV</b> is the first game in the franchise to use physics middlewares, and is also the first Open World game to use Euphoria. There are many other features that Euphoria helps simulate, ranging from grabbing onto a car door to making Niko dynamically struggle to stand up straight when he is drunk.</p><p style="">Havok is another middleware used in GTA <b>IV</b>. It is only used for rigid bodies and vehicle dynamics. A rigid body is an object that cannot be deformed in any way. Remember that while props such as fences can be broken, it does not mean that they are not rigid bodies; instead of them splintering dynamically like real life, the engine is simply switching out the models. Havok has been implemented with quite a few AAA games, and is currently the world's leading physics middleware.</p><h2>Dating</h2><p style="">Expanding on <a href="../../grand-theft-auto-san-andreas/61-7120/" rel="nofollow">GTA: San Andreas</a>'s dating simulations, GTA IV allows Niko to take dates to bars, bowling alleys, cabaret acts, comedy clubs, darts bars, and pool clubs. He can also take characters from the main storyline that are friends to these destinations in order to obtain various bonuses. At these places, the player either watches a short performance or plays a minigame, except when going drinking.</p><p style="">Going drinking results in Niko and his companion emerging from their watering-hole extremely inebriated and unable to walk or drive straight. This resulted in some controversy over the inclusion of drunk-driving. The safe way to get back home though, as in real life, is to hail a taxi.</p><p style="">Comedians <a href="../../ricky-gervais/94-999/" rel="nofollow">Ricky Gervais</a> and <a href="../../katt-williams/94-214/" rel="nofollow">Katt Williams</a> make appearances as themselves in comedy clubs.</p><h2>Internet</h2><p style="">GTA IV is the first in the series to feature a browsable, fictional Internet.

It was developed by Incognito Entertainment for the PS3 and released on August 28, 2007. Warhawk is strictly a multiplayer experience, though a single-player mode was planned and scrapped. Warhawk marks the first time a PlayStation 3 game was released on both Blu-ray disc and as a download through the PlayStation Network. While the two versions are compatible, there were some differences. While the PSN version was cheaper, the disc-based version included a number of behind-the-scenes featurettes, as well as a Bluetooth headset for in-game voice-chat. The disc based version also lets you host Warhawk Lan Parties with only one copy of the disc between multiple PS3's. <h2>Gameplay</h2> <figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/438/271270-106029_7_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-271270" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/438/271270-106029_7_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-271270"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/438/271270-106029_7_2.jpg"></a><figcaption>A Warhawk in flight on the Eucadia map.</figcaption></figure>Warhawk supports online multiplayer matches with up to 32 players in a single game and 4 way online splitscreen from a single PS3, Sony and Incognito provided dedicated servers for players to play on, additionally individual players could also create their own servers. Though the player begins as a bare soldier armed only with a combat blade and pistol, he can jump into an assortment of land-based vehicles, turrets, as well as the titular Warhawks, which are essentially futuristic harrier jets, able to switch between a hover and a forward-thrust mode. The game includes Sixaxis support when piloting a Warhawk, though you can also opt for traditional, analog-stick-based controls. There are six match types in Warhawk: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Zones, Hero and Collection.<br />The game is divided into two different factions the names of the factions are Eucadians and the Chernovans. Each have unique uniforms and vehicle designs for each, gaining experience and leveling up unlocks different uniforms and designs for vehicles, as well as various insignia that are displayed on different parts of the player and their Warhawk / Nemesis.  <br /> <br /><h2>Weapons in Warhawk </h2><br /><b> Assault Rifle-</b> Shoots very fast but does little damage when far away.  <br /><br /><b> RPG-</b> Shoots missiles and also allows you to lock on to Warhawks and take them down.  <br /><br /><b> Pistol- </b>You always have the pistol when you spawn good weapon for close combat situations. It also has infinite ammo. <br /><br /><b> Knife-</b> This weapon kills anybody in 1 hit if you manage to hurt somebody with it.   <br /><br /><b> Mines-</b> Lay these on Warhawks or Vehicles and be ready for a pretty explosion. These explode on proximity. <br /><br /><b> Binoculars-</b> These handy little weapons are used for "air strikes" you paint whatever you want to air-strike and seconds later the air-strike will happen. <br /><br /><b> Sniper Rifle-</b> use this weapon for very long range shooting. This is the only weapon in the game that you can aim with-press R3 to zoom in, and press it again to zoom it further. <br /><br /><b> Wrench- </b>You can use this weapon to heal your troops vehicles or your own. You can also deal damage to the opposing teams vehicles if you hit their vehicle with the wrench. <br /><br /><b> Health mines-</b> These devices have a spray that heal your team if they are close enough to the mine, or they hurt the other team if they get to close to the mine. <br /><br /><b> Flamethrower</b>- This weapon can be very deadly to anybody to close to the flame and is very handy for taking care of enemy vehicles.<br /><br /><h2>Vehicles in Warhawk</h2><br /><b> Tank-</b> Very slow but very powerful. This vehicle is mainly used to defend bases or just steam roll through another teams base. The front of the tank shoots a shell that explodes on impact damaging or even hurting anybody around the explosion. Also if you are very accurate if you hit a Warhawk with a tank shell it will automatically be taken down.<br /><br /><b> Jeep-</b> These little cars are used to move troops across the map. The jeep has a 50 Caliber turret on the back which can damage other  vehicles and players. <br /><br /><b> Warhawks-</b> These vehicles can be very deadly in the right hands. Warhawks are what this game is all about. They are very fast and can deal massive amounts of damage with all the weapons they can carry. They are fragile so watch out for RPG's or tanks before flying to close to other players. <br /> <br /><b>APC</b>- Included in Operation Broken Mirror. The APC is a large ground based transport unit that can also serve as a mobile spawn point. The APC has no weapons, but includes a deployable shield generator that units on the outside can not shoot through. However, the generator can be short circuited by a fully charged lightning gun. If you spawn into to APC you are awarded a random weapon. The APC also has a charge move that will cause it to accelerate forward at high speeds. The charge move can damage and destroy ground units. Jeep in one hit. Tank in two. Ect.. <br /> <br /><b>Dropship</b>- Included in Operation Omega Dawn. The Dropship is a air based transport and attack unit that can carry people as well as jeeps. The Dropship has two flight modes similar to the Warhawk: a hover mode were it can fire weapons and a flight mode for faster travel. For each teammate that is traveling in the Dropship another rocket turret becomes controllable. This makes a fully loaded Dropship a powerhouse. The pilot of the Dropship can also control side mounted guns while in hover mode. If you fill a Dropship with players you will receive a trophy.      <br /><br /> <br /><h2>Weapons for the Warhawk and Dropship<br /></h2>   <br />Aside from your normal machine gun turrets, the Warhawk and the Dropship can obtain weapons which are in the air for more damaging effects to air-based strategy/choke points, turrets, bases, or even enemy Warhawks. <br /> <br /><b>Swarm Missile-</b>You start off with 5 of these when you are within a Warhawk. Multiples of these can lock onto an enemy Warhawk, but they don't do very much damage. They also don't lock on very well and can be evaded fairly easily. However, they are great for applying constant pressure in dogfights. <br /> <br /><b>Homing Missile-</b>These are insanely strong missiles that are much harder to avoid. These are brutal. <br /> <br /><b>Air Mines-</b>Like mines, but in the air. They're pretty easy to see, but can ensure that your opponent does not get to a specific point in the map. Also can be hidden in clouds, and be careful! They can blow you up as well.<br /> <br /><b>Lightning Bolt-</b>Lightning bolts are one of the most deadly things to use on your opponent's base. You get 10 ammo, but you can shoot one charged burst by holding R1. This makes the lightning bolt last for a while, destroying anything within its radius.<br /><br /><b>Stealth-</b>Stealth makes you-almost-invisible. You can still see an outline, but unless you are an idiot, they shouldn't be able to see you. Perfect for getting behind your enemy. <br /> <br /><b>TOW Missile</b>-Missiles that you can direct and have a pretty large blast radius. Perfect for getting rid of choke points and bases from afar. <br /> <br /><b>Cluster Bomb-</b>Little bombs that bombard the ground below and blow up. Great for objective based games like Capture the Flag, since you can stop them in their tracks from way up in the air.  <br /> <br /><b>Flak-</b>Gets rid of any incoming locked on missiles. Useful for getting out of a hairy situation.<br /> <br /><br /><h2>The points system</h2><br />During a round you earn 3 types of points: Combat, Team &amp; Bonus. Combat points are earned for killing the enemy. Team points are earned for non-combat activities like capturing bases. Bonus Points are earned via the Ribbons received in a round.<br /><b> </b> <br /><h2>Rank System</h2><br />Warhawk features an in-game ranking system based on the points accumulated during online matches, and a few other requirements, including obtaining certain badges and ribbons.<b> </b><br /><br /><h2>Additional Content</h2> <br /><h3>Home</h3>[Update] A Warhawk room has been released early this year in which players launch a game from. <br /><br /><h3>Booster Packs and Patches</h3> Warhawk has been supported with additional content, including Maps and new vehicles.

Standing with Zeus is <a href="/poseidon/3005-1347/" data-ref-id="3005-1347"> Poseidon</a>, <a href="/hermes/3005-4421/" data-ref-id="3005-4421"> Hermes</a>, <a href="/hades/3005-1294/" data-ref-id="3005-1294"> Hades</a>, and <a href="/helios/3005-11259/" data-ref-id="3005-11259"> Helios</a>. During this scene, Poseidon attacks Gaia impeding the Titans ability to climb Mount Olympus. Kratos is then able to kill Poseidon. Soon after, Gaia along with Kratos are able to reach the top of mount Olympus only to be pushed off by Zeus.</p><p style="">Kratos lands in the river of Styx, where his powers are drained, he than meets Athena's ghost. She gives him the <a href="/blades-of-exile/3055-4107/" data-ref-id="3055-4107"> Blades of Exile</a> and helps Kratos on his journey to kill Zeus. Kratos soon learns that Pandora's Box still exists with the power to kill a God even after <a href="/ares/3005-1098/" data-ref-id="3005-1098"> Ares</a> died. The box is protected by the Flame of Olympus and the only way to put out the flame and reach the box, is to sacrifice <a href="/pandora/3005-14625/" data-ref-id="3005-14625"> Pandora</a>. However, Pandora is being held in a Labyrinth. Once Kratos finds her he takes her up to the flame and makes the sacrifice. Once he opens the box he realizes that it is empty and that he just killed a child for nothing, just as he killed his family in vain. This leaves Kratos with another regret on his mind. After this, Kratos kills Zeus. However, his spirit is still alive and attacks Kratos. Kratos then goes into his own mind and finds hope inside him, forgiving himself for all of the bad things that he had done in his life. Including the killing of <a href="/athena/3005-1145/" data-ref-id="3005-1145"> Athena</a>, his Wife, his Daughter and Pandora. Once Kratos returns from inside his own mind, he kills Zeus for good.</p><p style="">Athena tells Kratos that when he first opened Pandora's box he let out all of the good and bad things in it, the good power was the power of hope. The bad powers in the box corrupted the God and Athena's power went to Kratos. This is why after the box was opened for the first time Zeus was corrupted by fear, and he became obsessed with killing Kratos. Athena then tells Kratos that she wants her power back, Kratos refuses then impales himself with the sword of Olympus, releasing the power for the whole world to use and angering Athena. Kratos is now then left dead on the ground in a pool of blood.</p><p style="">Once the credits are done rolling, you see the place where Kratos was lying dead, however there is a blood trail leading off the edge of a cliff with no body in sight, potentially leaving room for another sequel.</p><h2>The David Jaffe Plot Cut</h2><p style="">In an interview with GameTrailers David Jaffe explained that he had a completely different plot line for God of War 3. In his version the game would start off with a boss fight between Kratos and Zeus which at the end of it Zeus gets killed by Kratos. The moment Zeus dies we would see all the other god from other mythologies, mainly Norse and Egyptian, appear in Mount. Olympus since the death of Zeus left a sort of power vacuum in Mount. Olympus. The other gods would then start fighting amongst themselves in order to figure out who will take over the world. Kratos would then meet his egyptian and norse counterparts who would explained to him that they too have been seeking vengeance on the gods and would then merge their powers together in order to give them a better chance at winning. Kratos then realizes that in order to kill the gods you need to make mortals stop believing in them. Without realizing Kratos' plan was already in effect. Because the gods were too busy with their infighting they forgot about the mortal world and as such the world started getting plagued with all sorts of natural disasters. In their absence the people's prayers for salvation go unanswered and because of that the people stopped believing in the gods. This gives all three versions of kratos' the edge they needed and they proceeds to kill gods from various mythologies. The game would end after all the gods were dead some killed by the Titans and some were killed by the egyptian and norse version of Kratos and the Titans restoring order to the world. Kratos would then commit suicide by his blades in order to be with his family and to finally be at peace. The final scene in the game would be the player controlling the three wise men following the north star (there a picture which depicts this scene in God of War 2) and thus the birth of a new religion.</p><p style="">In this version would have seen kratos fighting the mighty gorgon <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stheno" rel="nofollow"> Stheno</a> and eventually chopping off her head in accordance with the Rule of Three (In previous games Kratos killed Stheno younger sisters <a href="/euryale/3005-1300/" data-ref-id="3005-1300"> Euryale</a> and <a href="/medusa/3005-1100/" data-ref-id="3005-1100"> Medusa</a>). The game would have also feature the sphinx as a boss fight with Kratos fighting him then using the Head of Stheno in order to to turn the sphinx into stone which would explain his present location. The game would have also feature Kratos fighting Thor and Ra.</p><h2><b>Gameplay</b></h2><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10024/837774-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-837774" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.83333333333333" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:83.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10024/837774-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-837774"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10024/837774-4.jpg"></a><figcaption>Kratos wearing the Cestus</figcaption></figure><p style="">The gameplay is reminiscent of previous games in the series, consisting of battling a variety of gruesome enemies with a range of weapons and magical attacks.</p><p style="">Kratos is able to mount giant Cyclopes and use them in a vehicular fashion to take out enemies, or he can jump and grab flying enemies, kill them, and dive bomb back to the ground sending enemies flying into the air. A small portion of the game takes place while Kratos is riding the enormous Titans, and therefore the levels dynamically change and move around based on how the Titans are climbing or moving. If they stand up, the level suddenly becomes a vertical playing field and so on. Another interesting not is that the enemy is already much better then previous games, however if there is a field commander present at the location that Kratos is currently in, the enemies will fight even harder and attempt to flank Kratos. An example of the field commanders that have already been shown is the Centaur.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/888268-2uzqh3b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-888268" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/888268-2uzqh3b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-888268"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/19745/888268-2uzqh3b.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/19745/888268-2uzqh3b.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>You will die!</figcaption></figure><p style="">Similar to the head of the Medusa from the original game, Kratos acquires the head of the God Helios which has a couple of uses that Kratos will exploit. The first one is that the head reveals hidden doors that were cloaked from view, thanks to the wide sunbeams that are projected from his mouth. The second use for the head is as a lantern. Another item that you will obtain in God of War III is the Boots of Hermes. These are described in the game as, "Shoes taken from the messenger of the gods. They grant the gift of agility." With these Boots you are able to run along side of walls and up walls that would be impossible to jump up. Kratos will also have the Bow of Apollo, a fiery bow that once belonged to the God Apollo. With this bow you can set fire to some objects that block your path. You can also use this against enemies, you can set them on fire by charging up the bow or you can quickly tap the button to fire rapidly.</p><p style="">All of the weapons in God of War III have a grapple attack. With this all new attack you can throw yourself towards an enemy. Every weapon in the game is able to use this attack. It is performed by holding the L1 button and pressing .</p><h2>Weapons</h2><h3>Blades of Exile</h3><p style="">These blades will be your most powerful ally against Olympus. They are Kratos' signature weapons, similar to his weapons in the first and second games: Blades of Chaos and Blades of Athena. They are given to you by Athena.</p><p style=""><b>Magic attack:</b></p><p style="">Summons a dome of shields that fall from the sky, damaging all nearby enemies. Spears then thrust from the shields in all directions, damaging all enemies at a further range. Upon further upgrading, a prompt will appear telling the player to repeatedly press the button, causing a flurry of arrows to fall from the sky, again damaging all enemies at an even further range.</p><h3><b>Claws of Hades</b></h3><p style="">Taken from Lord Hades, these cruel hooks grant you power over souls. This purple weapon is very similar to the Blades of Exile, as they have chains that allow for a longer range and wider area. They also differ in speed, as the Claws are a bit faster and less powerful than the Blades of Exile.</p><p style=""><b>Magic attack:</b></p><p style="">Summons souls from fallen enemies to attack for you, you start with three basic souls and gain three with each upgrade.</p><h3>Nemean Cestus</h3><p style="">Flamed Gauntlets given to Hercules when he slew the Nemean Lion. Short Range, slow and very powerful. Taken from Hercules's corpse.</p><p style=""><b>Magic attack:</b></p><p style="">This weapon slams the Gauntlets down to the ground sending a shockwave out in front of Kratos.</p><h3>Nemesis Whip</h3><p style="">Crafted from the Omphalos stone by the smith God Hephaestus. This weapon carries electricity and is able to charge certain objects with electricity in the environment and is used in one small puzzle.</p><p style=""><b>Magic attack:</b></p><p style="">This weapon zaps your enemies with a bolt of electricity.</p><h2>Extras</h2><p style="">Like every God of War game, there are a handful of extra's that you can watch or complete after you beat the main game the first time through. A list of challenges, called "The Challenges of Olympus" is unlocked after your first play through, and a Combat Arena is unlocked after you complete all of the challenges. There is also a documentary video that shows the development of God of War 3 in the extras menu. Also, there are many additional costumes Kratos can gain, unfortunately the only one unlocked from playing the actual game is the fear costume. The other costumes are Apollo, Phantom of Chaos, Forgotten Warrior, Dominus, and Morpheus Armor, these are gained through preorders/promotions with Amazon, Gamestop, Gamecrazy, The Ultimate God of War 3 box, and slurpee.com respectively. An additional game difficulty, Chaos Difficulty, is unlocked after the first play through on any other difficulty.</p><h2>Information</h2><p style=""><a href="/cory-barlog/3040-63532/" data-ref-id="3040-63532"> Cory Barlog</a> wrote the overarching story of how the trilogy ends as well as the base of the game layout and design. Barlog also mentioned at a God of War II launch event that this game would run at full 1080p resolution, though it turned out that the final version will run natively in 720p with the ability to upscale to 1080p. The game also supports rumble functions. Barlog also expressed an interest in adding a cooperative mode, but this and the SIXAXIS controls were not put into the final product.</p><p style=""><a href="/david-jaffe/3040-44184/" data-ref-id="3040-44184"> David Jaffe</a> has said of the story that, "God of War explains, or ultimately will explain, why there are no more Greek myths." He has also stated that it will be "hell on earth" as the Gods and the Titans battle each other for domination, and that the series will explore the question of whether "man needs god". David Jaffe has expressed interest to be involved in some way with the development of God of War III, but since he left <a href="/sony-computer-entertainment-america/3010-313/" data-ref-id="3010-313"> SCEA</a> his influence would be minimal. Barlog has since left SCEA and has stated that the development changes that go on in God of War are, "outta my control now ". <a href="/stig-asmussen/3040-42647/" data-ref-id="3040-42647"> Stig Asmussen</a> has taken over the role of director. Asmussen revealed to Gamepro that the endings to the series, under both Jaffe and Barlog, would have been drastically different than what he implemented in God of War III. In Jaffe's ending Kratos would kill Zeus and right around the corner would be Norse Mythology. In Barlog's ending Kratos would become <a href="/death/3005-955/" data-ref-id="3005-955"> Death</a> himself and his blades would turn into sickles resembling Death's <a href="/scythe/3055-95/" data-ref-id="3055-95"> scythe</a>.</p><ul><li>Unlike the first two iterations in the series where there were only 15 enemies on screen, there will now be up to 50 this time.</li><li>Enemies can also jump on Kratos, eventually weighing him down and smothering him. This can be broken by wiggling the analogue stick.</li></ul><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/888635-73j62t.png" data-ref-id="1300-888635" data-size="large" style="width: 960px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="960" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/888635-73j62t.png" data-ref-id="1300-888635"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/19745/888635-73j62t.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/19745/888635-73j62t.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Example of Kratos breaking out of a pile-up.</figcaption></figure><ul><li>You can ride monsters like the Cyclops and “control” them.</li></ul><ul><li>Kratos on the PlayStation 2 used 5,000 polygons, where as now he uses 20,000.</li></ul><ul><li>Weapons have been added and enhanced to improve variety.

previous games, but with added online functionality you can now download new songs and share your performances with other users.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview </h2><p style="">The first installment in the popular SingStar series to hit the PlayStation 3 is simply titled SingStar. Unlike most of the PlayStation 2 releases, SingStar PS3 doesn't come with a specific genre or era tied to it. Instead, the song list attempts to cover multiple genres, with more of a focus on songs that are popular in a specific territory. For example, the French release of this game has a track from French house pioneers, Daft Punk. </p><br/><p style="">The goal of SingStar is to match the pitch and cadence of the original songs by singing into one of two microphones. With two players, the songs can be broken up into duets. At the end of each song, a score is given based on how well each player sings. </p> <p style="">SingStar on the PlayStation 3 also adds a substantial online component to the game.  </p><h2>SingStore  </h2><p style="">The SingStore allows players to download additional songs for a fee. In the US, songs cost $1.49 and include both the song and the music video, which plays in the background while you sing. While the game's European launch was plagued with infrequent store updates and an initially paltry selection, the US version launched with 200 songs already available for purchase. </p><h2>SingStar Online Profile</h2><p style="">The other online component in SingStar is a cross between a video upload site and a social networking application. Players create profiles, fill out brief "about yourself" questions, and from there, players can upload and view 30-second video clips of song performances. These videos can be rated by other users. Snapshots and audio recordings can also be posted for other users. </p> <h2>Tracklists</h2> <h3>International Tracklist</h3> <ul class="plain-list"><li>The Automatic -  <em>Monste</em><em>r</em></li> <li>Blink-182 -

Developed and published by Midway, the game brings to fans many of their favorite wrestlers in both likeness and voice, and allows them to duke it out in fast-paced matches with less emphasis on the submission maneuvers found in many pro-wrestling games and more on combative wrestling moves. AJ Styles, Samoa Joe, Christopher Daniels, Senshi, Sonjay Dutt, and Jeff Jarrett were brought in to provide the motion capture animations for the game. Every real life TNA wrestler had their bodies scanned in for an authentic look and an original character was made specifically for the game, Suicide, who jumped into reality on TNA programming shortly after the game's release.<br/><br/> <h2>Story</h2>The story revolves around the wrestler Suicide who fights his way back to the top of TNA after receiving a severe beating and left for dead in Mexico. After his vicious attack, Suicide has a plastic surgery procedure done introducing his new look (the player's created wrestler) and has no recollection as to who he is or what happened to him. Players then participate in matches  in the middle of nowhere leading to a tryout and eventually a spot on the TNA roster. Once with TNA you will fight your way through all 3 tiers (tag, X-Division &amp; World Heavyweight) regaining memories along the way until you finally remember who you are and what happened to you.<br/><b> <h2>Wrestlers</h2></b>TNA iMPACT! features 25 of TNA's finest wrestlers and 5 bonus characters but excludes the TNA Knockouts.<br/><br/> <h3>Roster:</h3> <ul class="plain-list"> <li><a data-ref-id="3005-36" href="/aj-styles/3005-36/" slug="aj-styles">                            AJ Styles</a></li> <li><a data-ref-id="3005-100" href="/samoa-joe/3005-100/" slug="samoa-joe">                           Samoa Joe</a></li> <li><a data-ref-id="3005-255" href="/booker-t/3005-255/" slug="booker-t">                          Booker T</a></li> <li><a data-ref-id="3005-251" href="/christian-cage/3005-251/" slug="christian-cage">                         Christian Cage</a></li> <li><a data-ref-id="3005-250" href="/christopher-daniels/3005-250/" slug="christopher-daniels">                        Christopher Daniels</a></li> <li><a data-ref-id="3005-249" href="/hernandez/3005-249/" slug="hernandez">                       Hernandez</a></li> <li><a data-ref-id="3005-248" href="/homicide/3005-248/" slug="homicide">                      Homicide</a></li> <li><a data-ref-id="3005-234" href="/jay-lethal/3005-234/" slug="jay-lethal">                     Jay Lethal</a></li> <li><a data-ref-id="3005-199" href="/kurt-angle/3005-199/" slug="kurt-angle">                    Kurt Angle</a></li> <li><a data-ref-id="3005-54" href="/sting/3005-54/" slug="sting">                   Sting </a></li> <li><a data-ref-id="3005-117" href="/rhino/3005-117/" slug="rhino">                  Rhino </a></li> <li><a data-ref-id="3005-16" href="/tomko/3005-16/" slug="tomko">                 Tomko</a></li> <li><a data-ref-id="3005-233" href="/jeff-jarrett/3005-233/" slug="jeff-jarrett">                Jeff Jarrett</a></li> <li><a data-ref-id="3005-37" href="/abyss/3005-37/" slug="abyss">               Abyss</a></li> <li><a data-ref-id="3005-93" href="/senshi/3005-93/" slug="senshi">              Senshi</a></li> <li><a data-ref-id="3005-95" href="/scott-steiner/3005-95/" slug="scott-steiner">             Scott Steiner</a></li> <li><a data-ref-id="3005-252" href="/chris-sabin/3005-252/" slug="chris-sabin">            Chris Sabin</a></li> <li><a data-ref-id="3005-43" href="/alex-shelley/3005-43/" slug="alex-shelley">           Alex Shelley</a></li> <li><a data-ref-id="3040-4628" href="/eric-young/3040-4628/" slug="eric-young">          Eric Young</a></li> <li><a data-ref-id="3005-89" href="/shark-boy/3005-89/" slug="shark-boy">         Shark Boy</a></li> <li><a data-ref-id="3005-211" href="/kevin-nash/3005-211/" slug="kevin-nash">        Kevin Nash</a></li> <li><a data-ref-id="3005-110" href="/robert-roode/3005-110/" slug="robert-roode">       Robert Roode</a></li> <li><a data-ref-id="3005-11058" href="/james-storm/3005-11058/" slug="james-storm">      James Storm</a></li> <li><a data-ref-id="3005-72" href="/sonjay-dutt/3005-72/" slug="sonjay-dutt">     Sonjay Dutt</a></li> <li><a data-ref-id="3005-253" href="/brother-ray/3005-253/" slug="brother-ray">    Brother Ray</a></li> <li><a data-ref-id="3005-254" href="/brother-devon/3005-254/" slug="brother-devon">   Brother Devon</a></li></ul><br/> <h3>DLC Characters:</h3> <ul class="plain-list"> <li><a data-ref-id="3005-146" href="/petey-williams/3005-146/" slug="petey-williams">  Petey Williams</a></li> <li><a data-ref-id="3005-250" href="/christopher-daniels/3005-250/" slug="christopher-daniels"> Curry Man</a></li> <li>Mike Tenay</li></ul> <b><br/> <h2>Matches<br/></h2></b> <ul class="plain-list"> <li>Standard</li> <li>Tag Team </li> <li>Free For All</li> <li>Ultimate X </li> <li>Ultimate X Free For All </li> <li>Submission </li> <li>Falls Count Anywhere </li> <li>Falls Count Anywhere Tag </li> <li>Handicap</li></ul><br/> <b> <h2>Online</h2></b>The Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 versions of the game enable players to battle online with up to two players.

The game revolves around the protagonist's bionic arm used for swinging, and combat.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Bionic Commando is an action adventure game, and is a direct sequel to the <a href="/bionic-commando/3030-7860/" data-ref-id="3030-7860"> NES classic of the same name</a>. The game was developed by now defunct GRIN, who also recently helmed the updated remake of the NES game titled <a href="/bionic-commando-rearmed/3030-20483/" data-ref-id="3030-20483"> Bionic Commando Rearmed</a>. The main focus of the game is <a href="/nathan-rad-spencer/3005-124/" data-ref-id="3005-124"> Nathan "RAD" Spencer</a>'s (the protagonist) <a href="/bionic-arm/3055-1263/" data-ref-id="3055-1263"> bionic arm</a> which is used both as means for transportation by swinging and climbing but also as a weapon. Bionic Commando features linear environments designed with the arm's swinging mechanic in mind. To make better use of the bionic arm it's functions have increased significantly compared to the original game.</p><p style="">While primarily designed as a single player game, it includes an elaborate 10 player multiplayer component that differentiates itself from other games by including the swinging mechanic within the game's 16 included maps.</p><h2><b>Plot</b></h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/371858-189368_9_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-371858" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/371858-189368_9_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-371858"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3699/371858-189368_9_2.jpg"></a><figcaption>Nathan in action.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Bionic Commando takes place 10 years after the classic Bionic Commando for the <a href="/nes/3045-21/" data-ref-id="3045-21"> NES</a> and a few years after the weekly updated comic book <a href="http://www.bioniccommando.com/us/comics/view" rel="nofollow"> Bionic Commando: Chain of Command</a>. We find series protagonist Nathan "RAD" Spencer (voiced by <a href="/mike-patton/3040-82285/" data-ref-id="3040-82285"> Mike Patton</a>) as a government operative working in a city called Ascension City, where he is betrayed by the government, separated from his bionic arm and set for execution. On the day of his execution, a massive bomb explodes in Ascension City, unleashing an earthquake along with a radioactive shock wave that destroys the city and wipes out its population. The city is under threat of an invasion from a terrorist group called BioReign, bionically enhanced individuals that were once part of the Federal States Of America.</p><p style="">The government decided that the bionic technology was too dangerous to control and issued the Bionic Purge, shutting down all military programs that issued soldiers with bionics. Additionally, the purge required existing bionic soldiers to remove their enhancements. Instead of losing their limbs, many soldiers became fugitives and joined the mysterious terrorist organization BioReign. The government decides to release Nathan "RAD" Spencer from his death sentence to investigate the group and put a stop to them. While Spencer has no motive to help the people who imprisoned him, <a href="/super-joe/3005-52/" data-ref-id="3005-52"> Joseph " Super Joe" Gibson</a> exchanges information about Spencer's missing wife, Emily, for full cooperation.</p><p style="">At the beginning of the game, the motive and groups behind the destruction of Ascension City are unknown to Super Joe and the F.S.A., though the terrorist group BioReign is held in high suspicion. Agreeing to help the F.S.A. with an investigation, Spencer is launched into the heart of the city separate from his bionic arm. After finding his arm and putting it on, he dives into the city to investigate the cause of the explosion. A few encounters with hostile combatants have reaffirmed previous suspicions, and Spencer's investigation quickly turns into a single-man operation against a bionically-enhanced army.</p><p style="">Throughout the game, Spencer finds a large number of relays that provide a few pieces of the game's backstory as well as profile information on Nathan Spencer. Beyond disabling minefields, hacking relays also allow Super Joe and the government to keep an eye on Spencer's current position. Spencer is reluctant to the idea, but revealing his current position would help the government drop insertion pods with heavy-duty equipment (shotguns, grenade launchers, etc.). The thought additional equipment causes Spencer to quickly rescind his previous statements.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6384/1063530-mag2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1063530" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.64" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:64.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6384/1063530-mag2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1063530"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/6384/1063530-mag2.jpg"></a><figcaption>Jayne "Mag" Magdalene</figcaption></figure><p style="">Along the way, Spencer runs into <a href="/jayne-mag-magdalene/3005-10904/" data-ref-id="3005-10904"> Jayne "Mag" Magdalene</a>, another bionic soldier whose enhancement is bionic leggings. Their brief encounter shows that Mag has defected to BioReign's side, though their reunion is cut off by the shot of a mysterious sniper sent to watch over Spencer. Then, he is given task of finding a crashed F.S.A. plane in hopes of recovering its video data. After recovering the data, navigating to the top of the F.S.A. and uploading the video, he engages in combat against a Buraq helicopter. Successful in his fight, Spencer jumps off the building and into the city's underground tunnels.</p><p style="">In the middle of his tunnel excursion, Spencer is given the new task of retrieving an item known as the Carrion Device inside the Federal Archives Building. The Carrion Device, an important part of Project Vulture, was a secret government project created as a countermeasure against bionic technology, should the time ever come to use it. However, the decoded video data retrieved from the crashed F.S.A. plane have shown BioReign's interest in the device. Despite the Secretary of Defense's hatred of bionically-enhanced people, he has no choice but to entrust the location and care of the device to Spencer, who quickly races to its hiding spot. Unfortunately, his arrival at the Federal Archives Building is also met with BioReign's arrival. After disposing of all the soldiers, he secures the device and heads into the underground tunnels once again.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/724531-48.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-724531" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.55758880516685" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:55.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/724531-48.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-724531"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/724531-48.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/724531-48.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Mohole</figcaption></figure><p style="">This time, Spencer comes across the <a href="/the-mohole/3005-12394/" data-ref-id="3005-12394"> Mohole</a>, a mechanical worm responsible for digging the tunnels beneath Ascension City for BioReign. After emerging from the ground, he engages in a grueling fight with the Mohole in a vacant parking lot. Spencer eventually wins and gains access to yet another tunnel leading to Port Anderson, the evacuation spot for both the Carrion Device and himself. Yet, Port Anderson proves to be a tricky endeavor for the bionic commando; among the thunderstorm and night, he also has to contend with numerous BioReign operatives and improved versions of Biomechs. Spencer tries to keep contact with Super Joe only to receive static on the other end, supposedly due to interference by the lightning.</p><p style="">Eventually, Spencer reaches Super Joe and proceeds to hand over the device. In another unfortunate turn of events, it ends up that Super Joe has been collaborating with BioReign from the start. Additionally, BioReign is also led by <a href="/gottfried-groeder/3005-6443/" data-ref-id="3005-6443"> Gottfried Groeder</a>, who supposedly died during the crash of the Albatross ten years ago. After taking the device, Super Joe and Groeder attempt to dispose of Spencer, hold Mag captive and head off to activate Project Vulture. Though Spencer would not be easily killed off, as he manages to stealthily land atop one of the enemy's Buraq helicopters. He skillfully traverses the Buraq armada and made his way into the helicopter that housed Super Joe. Despite all this, Spencer abandons his chance to get the Carrion Device as Mag falls out of the helicopter and he decides to jump after her.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6384/1063533-superjoe1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1063533" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.6425" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:64.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6384/1063533-superjoe1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1063533"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/6384/1063533-superjoe1.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/6384/1063533-superjoe1.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Joseph "Super Joe" Gibson</figcaption></figure><p style="">The daredevil jump lands them in a crevice and in the wake of the Constructor, BioReign's transportable headquarters. Aware the final battle is near, the mysterious sniper from before comes forth as a man only known as Silver. After exchanging very few words, Spencer leaves Mag and Silver behind and finds a way into the Constructor. There, he disables the cooling system and encounters Groeder for a nostalgic showdown; Spencer disposes Groeder and heads to the site of Project Vulture to stop Super Joe. At the site of a former T.A.S.C. lab, Spencer learns that his wife was used as a catalyst for his arm; Super Joe explains that for a long time scientists have tried to get machine that emulate humans, but the success of his bionics program stemmed from making humans that emulate machines.</p><p style="">Prior to the activation of Project Vulture, Super Joe kills Mag and takes flight using a bionic suit with an army of Vultures following behind. Spencer latches onto one of the Vultures and pursues his former ally into the sky. After disposing of a few Vultures, he encounters Super Joe and kills him, thus disabling the entirety of Project Vulture. With nothing to latch his arm onto, Spencer falls from the sky and the game ends with no finite conclusion.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1570/624812-bc01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-624812" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1570/624812-bc01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-624812"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1570/624812-bc01.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1570/624812-bc01.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Swinging.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The game's core contrivance is the <a href="/bionic-arm/3055-1263/" data-ref-id="3055-1263"> bionic arm</a> (also referred to as the wire, the cable or the hook). The skillful use of the arm has repeatedly been emphasized by the developer as the game's primary differentiators from other action adventure titles. Players can use it to get to high places that would otherwise be impossible to reach by grappling and jumping off surfaces. It can also be used for lateral movement by swinging. By doing so, players can gain a lot of distance by never touching the ground. Much like the NES title, management of stable ground-based gunplay with dramatically lowered mobility is a must. Strategic movement is needed to gain the drop on the enemy and maintain an advantage. Through effective use of the environment, the bionic arm may be used to throw large objects at enemies, take cover on the sides of buildings or kite enemies for an effortless kill.</p><p style="">The arm utilizes a separate, partially automated aiming reticule that snaps along the vertical axis based on the player's current trajectory and aiming direction. Players pull a left shoulder button to fire the arm and release the button to let go of whatever the arm has latched onto. Skillful timing is an important skill for players to master, and HUD elements indicate the optimal release time to maximize forward momentum.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/371851-189368_2_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-371851" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/371851-189368_2_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-371851"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3699/371851-189368_2_2.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3699/371851-189368_2_2.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>More swinging.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The arm can also be used as a weapon by hooking to enemies and zip kicking into them, the player also has the option to throw people up in the sky and shoot them in mid air. Like the top-down stages in the original NES game, the player is able to throw the bionic arm in a 360 degree circle and knock down multiple enemies at once. Most of the abilities are taught during the game's opening tutorial, but all of them are unlocked at later points in the game. The reasoning behind the <a href="/abilitease/3015-57/" data-ref-id="3015-57"> abilitease</a> is that bionics "take time to sync with the bearer". Later in the game, an adrenaline meter is unlocked to provide instant kills and enhanced versions of previous techniques.</p><p style="">Bionic Commando plays like most third-person shooters in that there's a third-person camera for shooting from the hip. By clicking the right analog stick, there's also an over-the-shoulder angle for improved accuracy. Commentary on Top Secret: The Bionic Commando Podcast suggests the game may have a novel mechanic in place for effectively targeting and shooting at enemies in mid-air while still maintaining separate control of the swing; though in-game evidence does not seem to exist.</p><h2>Multiplayer</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6384/1063557-bcmultiplayer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1063557" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.56765163297045" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6384/1063557-bcmultiplayer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1063557"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/6384/1063557-bcmultiplayer.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/6384/1063557-bcmultiplayer.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Multiplayer mode in action.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Designed by a separate GRIN team than the one responsible for the single player component, the game's multiplayer will support up to 8 players in the traditional modes of online play (deathmatch, capture the flag, and team deathmatch). It has been revealed that the bionic arm will be limited compared to its singleplayer counterpart, but that the swinging mechanic will be in place. Players will be able to attach it to both teammates and enemies as well as the environment. Zip kicks and heavy punches are still present, but throwing and kiting remain absent in the multiplayer mode. Players accumulate experience points from defeating other players, which only boost the player's current position on the leaderboards. Currently, there are no plans to correlate the experience points with a leveling system.</p><p style="">There are no customizable character options and joining a game will only randomize the color of the player's character. Even though the multiplayer mode was met with some poor reception due to an Xbox Live demo, it has been formally recognized by Major League Gaming. Numerous glitches such as rapid pistol fire and higher-damage shotgun blasts still plague the system and there are no plans for a patch at this time.</p><h2>Bionic Commando: Rearmed Connectivity</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/924890-bionic_commando_rearmed_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-924890" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.57875" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:57.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/924890-bionic_commando_rearmed_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-924890"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/924890-bionic_commando_rearmed_02.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/924890-bionic_commando_rearmed_02.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>BC: Rearmed, a remake of the NES game.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Owners of the downloadable title <a href="/bionic-commando-rearmed/3030-20483/" data-ref-id="3030-20483"> Bionic Commando: Rearmed</a> will find certain features unlocked in their copy of Bionic Commando. Most notably an retro skin and model for the player character similar to the player character in Bionic Commando: Rearmed. Two other unlockable extras include the Purple Matrix and the Prototype Weapon. The Purple Matrix unlocks a specific door with one of the game's Fissure levels (where within, there are models of various vehicles and a radio). The Prototype Weapon is an updated version of the Tungsten pistol, with higher accuracy and damage.</p><p style="">Bionic Commando was originally set to be the first retail game to sync with an Xbox Live Arcade title.

This amalgam of western and Japanese design philosophies is a first for Capcom Japan, and has been seen by some as somewhat of a risky venture. Poor sales may cause the company to reconsider its strategy, though Ben Judd has constantly reassured fans that most mistakes have been taken into consideration. In the future, Capcom hopes that the development of Bionic Commando will help provide better quality for titles such as <a href="/dead-rising-2/3030-25187/" data-ref-id="3030-25187"> Dead Rising 2</a>.</p><p style="">Creative director at GRIN, <a href="/ulf-andersson/3040-66261/" data-ref-id="3040-66261"> Ulf Andersson</a>, has described designing the bionic arm mechanic and handling the repercussions of giving players complete freedom of mobility the biggest hurdles encountered during development.</p><h3>Top Secret: The Bionic Commando Podcast</h3><p style="">While having virtually nothing to do with the game itself, Top Secret: The Bionic Commando Podcast was a large step for a company as tight-knit as Capcom Japan. At first, the executives at Capcom were reluctant to allow the company's localization team to speak candidly every week. Usually hosted by Assistant Producer Gearoid Reidy, the podcast featured guests from many sections of the gaming industry including:</p><p style=""><a href="/ben-judd/3040-58539/" data-ref-id="3040-58539"> Ben Judd</a> (Producer, Bionic Commando)</p><p style=""><a href="/keiji-inafune/3040-35794/" data-ref-id="3040-35794"> Keiji Inafune</a> (Capcom Head of R&amp;D)</p><p style=""><a href="/ryan-payton/3040-89538/" data-ref-id="3040-89538"> Ryan Payton</a> (Assistant Producer, Metal Gear Solid 4)</p><p style=""><a href="/minae-matsukawa/3040-26742/" data-ref-id="3040-26742"> Minae Matsukawa</a> (Producer, Ace Attorney series)</p><p style=""><a href="/simon-viklund/3040-90158/" data-ref-id="3040-90158"> Simon Viklund</a> (Creative Director, Bionic Commando: Rearmed)</p><p style=""><a href="/shane-bettenhausen/3040-90234/" data-ref-id="3040-90234"> Shane Bettenhausen</a> (1UP)</p><p style=""><a href="/jeff-gerstmann/3040-89712/" data-ref-id="3040-89712"> Jeff Gerstmann</a> (Giant Bomb)</p><p style=""><a href="/jun-takeuchi/3040-41365/" data-ref-id="3040-41365"> Jun Takeuchi</a> (Producer, Resident Evil 5)</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6384/1063562-bcpodcastcrew.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1063562" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6384/1063562-bcpodcastcrew.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1063562"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6384/1063562-bcpodcastcrew.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6384/1063562-bcpodcastcrew.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The people behind the podcast.</figcaption></figure><p style="">At certain times, the podcast was popular enough to crack the top 25 on iTunes' list of Games and Hobbies podcasts. While having Bionic Commando in its name, the podcast served more as look into Japanese game development and its contrast with western development. The bi-weekly show was popular for its humorous banter, hard-hitting questions against its own employees and nonsensical censorship. It was originally intended as an effort to get the word out via community efforts instead of through conventional ad campaigns; Gearoid Reidy has stated that the podcast may not have done its job while Ben Judd remains optimistic.</p><p style="">Numerous bits of trivia have spilled out of the podcast, including the numerous voices behind the Phoenix Wright and Onimusha series. On May 27th, 2009, the final episode of the podcast was released ending nearly two years after its conception. Currently, future plans will be unveiled on the Capcom Unity blog at some point.</p><h2>Critical Reception/Sales</h2><p style="">Even though the game was distinctly crafted for a western audience, Bionic Commando was met with reception ranging anywhere from poor to average when released in North America. The scores also corresponded to the sales numbers, as the game sold less than 27,000 units across both platforms during its first month on shelves. Sales projections from Capcom in 2008 predicted that the game would sell over one million units throughout the year. Strangely enough, the retail game sold roughly 100,000 units less than its downloadable counterpart, Bionic Commando: Rearmed. Ben Judd took Rearmed's sales as a point of optimism, saying that retail games ultimately sell much more than downloadable games.</p><p style="">Despite repeated worry over reception in Japan, Bionic Commando managed to get a score of 34/40 in Famitsu, boosting the potential for an ironically better performance overseas and netting itself a gold award. However, it's first week in Japan was met with sales totaling under 10,000 units. The PS3 version debuted as the number one Gaijin game for the week of June 28th, 2009 to July 4th, 2009 and number 26 on the overall sales chart for the week (the 360 version did worse at number three on the Gaijin list and number 31 on the overall sales chart). Plans for a sequel are looking unlikely at this point.</p><p style="">The most up-to-date sales data of this game is a total of 550,000 copies shipped, though amount of units sold still remains a mystery. Despite a great performance by other Capcom titles such as <a href="/resident-evil-5/3030-20569/" data-ref-id="3030-20569"> Resident Evil 5</a> and <a href="/street-fighter-iv/3030-20456/" data-ref-id="3030-20456"> Street Fighter IV</a> earlier in the year, Bionic Commando is heavily regarded as a flop. Today, the game is ridiculed by some critics because of its far-fetched ending.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p style="">On July 28th, 2009, the official soundtrack to Bionic Commando was distributed as a retail package via Sumthing Else Music Works and as a digital download through Sumthing Digital and the iTunes store. The soundtrack features 20 tracks from the game and excludes pieces such as sound effects or fanfares typical with some game's soundtrack release. Simon Viklund, Jamie Christopherson, Jonatan Crafoord, Trond-Viggo Melssen, Junko Tamiya, Erik Thunberg and José Luis Gonzalez Castro are the credited artists on the track listing.</p><h3>Track

style=""><em>This game is canceled, and should not have a release date or be attached to any concept, object, location, or character except the <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/canceled-games/3015-2310/" data-ref-id="3015-2310">Canceled Games</a> page. See the page for details.</em></p><h2>Overview</h2><p style="">In December 2006, SEGA announced that Obsidian Entertainment would develop an Alien role-playing game. The only tidbits of information they released about the game was that it <i>"will be developed for the next-generation systems and the PC"</i> and <i>"The role playing game will build upon the distinctive look and feel of the original films while utilizing next-generation technology to create an entirely different and unique Alien experience."</i></p><p style="">In February 2009 it was rumored that Obsidian Entertainment laid off more than 20 employees and that the Alien RPG project was canceled. No official word about the projects status has yet been issued by either Sega or Obsidian, but the rumor was confirmed a couple of days later by one of the employees that were laid off.</p><p style="">In June 2009 Obsidian confirmed they were no longer working on the project. Sega then released the following statement indicating that the game was officially cancelled:</p><blockquote>At this point, SEGA has no plans to move forward with the Aliens RPG. The Aliens franchise offers us so much content to choose from that we feel it important to take a step back and carefully consider the type of game we want to release. We plan to continue working with the Aliens franchise and ask fans to be patient and stay tuned for more information about what SEGA has coming out for the Aliens series of games, starting with the upcoming Alien vs. Predator game. We are very excited about and focused on Alien vs. Predator, which promises gamers a fantastic single player game and an equally compelling multiplayer experience. We are confident that it provides all the excitement and fun that the Aliens and Predator fans are looking for!</blockquote>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>20473</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/0/8830/833324-aliens_1_.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/8830/833324-aliens_1_.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/0/8830/833324-aliens_1_.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8830/833324-aliens_1_.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/8830/833324-aliens_1_.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/8830/833324-aliens_1_.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/0/8830/833324-aliens_1_.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Aliens RPG]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating/><original_release_date/><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/aliens-rpg/3030-20473/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[AITD

The game comes from the heralded <a href="/alone-in-the-dark/3025-28/" data-ref-id="3025-28">Alone in the Dark franchise</a>, but moves the age-old story to present day <a href="/new-york-city/3035-109/" data-ref-id="3035-109">New York</a>, while retaining the same protagonist. The PS2 and Wii versions are a different game featuring the same plot and cinematic sequences, developed by <a href="/hydravision-entertainment/3010-2567/" data-ref-id="3010-2567">Hydravision Entertainment.</a></p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">Alone in the Dark features several different gameplay styles, each offering their own unique contribution to the game. While the game is mainly played in the <a href="/third-person-perspective/3015-464/" data-ref-id="3015-464">3rd person</a>, which is used for exploration and when using <a href="/melee/3015-444/" data-ref-id="3015-444">melee</a> objects, the shooting aspect of the game is done completely in the <a href="/first-person-perspective/3015-330/" data-ref-id="3015-330">first person</a>. There are also several <a href="/puzzles/3015-932/" data-ref-id="3015-932">puzzles</a> in the game which need to be solved in order to progress, some of which are based on the in-game physics and many of which require logic and a great deal of trial and error.</p><p style="">Although most of Alone in the Dark is a straight forward action adventure title, a large part of the game, which takes place in Central Park, is a free roaming open world experience. The player is free to move around in the park and accomplish the objectives in whatever order the player sees fit. There are several dozen cars in the Central Park area which the player may choose to drive around in. Doing so minimizes travel time and provides more opportunities to explore the parts of Central Park. Some objectives can only be reached with the use of a vehicle.</p><p style="">Although there are many opportunities to use a vehicle there are only four basic models of cars that reappear throughout the park: <a href="/taxi-cab/3055-1139/" data-ref-id="3055-1139">Taxi Cab</a>, <a href="/police-car/3055-844/" data-ref-id="3055-844">Police Cruiser</a>, and two civilian model cars. There are other vehicles in the game but only appear when they are specific to a mission objective. Each vehicle has different items in the glove box for Carnby to collect and use to complete his objectives.</p><p style="">Alone in the Dark features a unique inventory system, which is tied to Carnby's jacket pockets. On the left side, he is able to hold necessities like tape, a <a href="/lighter/3055-1370/" data-ref-id="3055-1370">lighter</a>, a <a href="/knife/3055-295/" data-ref-id="3055-295">knife</a>, <a href="/bandages/3055-362/" data-ref-id="3055-362">bandages</a>, <a href="/ammo/3055-533/" data-ref-id="3055-533">ammo</a> and <a href="/flashlight/3055-156/" data-ref-id="3055-156">flashlight</a> batteries. On the right side, he has space to hold bottles, that could contain several things like gasoline or <a href="/alcoholic-beverages/3055-698/" data-ref-id="3055-698">alcohol</a>, medical spray, mosquito repellent, anti-rust spray and <a href="/flare/3055-973/" data-ref-id="3055-973">glow sticks/flares</a>. Carnby keeps his trusty <a href="/pistol/3055-59/" data-ref-id="3055-59">pistol</a> and flashlight strapped to his chest through out the game. The inventory system also allows for the combination of several items. Almost every combination one could imagine is possible in the game. For example the player can combine a rag with a alcohol bottle to create a convenient <a href="/molotov-cocktail/3055-75/" data-ref-id="3055-75">Molotov Cocktail</a> or combine the lighter and mosquito repellent to create a small and portable <a href="/flamethrower/3055-45/" data-ref-id="3055-45">flamethrower</a>.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1058/384748-29677_normal.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-384748" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.56216216216216" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1058/384748-29677_normal.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-384748"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1058/384748-29677_normal.jpg"></a><figcaption>Aerosol Flamethrower</figcaption></figure><p style="">A key element of the game is the ability to use fire as a weapon or as a problem solving element. The player is capable of putting wooden objects like chairs or tables up against a flame to create a portable <a href="/torch/3055-484/" data-ref-id="3055-484">torch</a> or a weapon to use against demons. Fire is capable of spreading from room to room, and is able to engulf almost every flammable object in the game. The enemies of Alone in the Dark can only be completely be destroyed by using fire, so using fire becomes an essential aspect of the game.</p><p style="">There is also a persistent damage system which is shown on Carnby's character model. The player will notice open wounds on Carnby as well as blood trails and droplets coming from him as he walks. The player must use the medical spray to heal minor wounds and bandage up those which are heavily bleeding. Some enemies in the game are attracted to blood so it is wise to bind all wounds as quickly as possible.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style="">Like the previous <a href="/alone-in-the-dark/3025-28/" data-ref-id="3025-28">Alone in the Dark</a> games, AitD stars <a href="/edward-carnby/3005-2537/" data-ref-id="3005-2537">Edward Carnby</a>, the main character in the original game, as he searches for clues and answers to explain the paranormal activity occurring in Central Park and the surrounding area of <a href="/manhattan/3035-1613/" data-ref-id="3035-1613">Manhattan</a>. Carnby wakes up with no memory of who he is and finds himself as the prisoner of the game's main antagonist Crowley. A museum curator named <a href="/theophile-paddington/3005-3733/" data-ref-id="3005-3733">Theophile</a> Paddington who knows the deepest secrets of the park is also held prisoner. After hell literally breaks loose in Manhattan and Carnby just narrowly escapes his death, he and Theophile get help from an art dealer named <a href="/sarah-flores/3005-3732/" data-ref-id="3005-3732">Sarah Flores</a>, who becomes Carnby's closest ally throughout the game.</p><p style="">The story is played out like a Television series with several chapters called episodes and a cliff-hanger ending at the end of each episode to encourage the player to jump in to the next chapter. Each chapter is broken down into smaller chunks called sequences. One has the ability to skip sequences or entire chapters just like in a DVD menu if they encounter a difficult or frustrating part of the game or if they want to play only a specific sequence.</p><h3>Episode 1 -

It addresses a number of gameplay issues in the previous versions, and a lot of the additions were patched into the Xbox version, such as:</p><ul><li><b>Enhanced Camera Control:</b> Players can now rotate the camera 360 Degrees all around the character without having to go to first-person view. The animation on the first-person view is also a lot better than before where the camera doesn't feel like it's sliding anymore.</li><li><b>Simplified Movement:</b> Edward can now walk and run by simply using the left analog stick without having to hold a button.</li><li><b>Easy Enemy Takedow</b><b>n:</b> When attacking enemies, they will be knocked unconscious for a longer period of time.</li><li><b>Better Inventory Screen:</b> The game will now pause when entering the inventory screen. Selecting an item is much better now without having to hold the analog stick in a certain direction. Item combination can now go both ways.</li><li><b>Batteries Not Included:</b> The flashlight now has unlimited battery life.</li><li><b>Improved Car Sequence:</b> The controlling of the car has been improved with added suspension and better steering.</li><li><b>Better Episode 2:</b> The earthquake that follows you at the end of Episode 2 (Sequence: 59th Street) is much slower now.

There are a number of different tactics that will allow you to get further in the game. Rios and Salem both have different play styles, and the weapons selected also add to the mix and diversity of the game. A new and innovative game play mechanic presented in the game is called <a data-ref-id="3015-105" href="/aggro/3015-105/">                                      Aggro</a>. This is the main mechanic that decides the way fights are played out. It is mainly a focus<i> </i>for enemies since they are aware of their surroundings and threats. There are a number of ways to increase and decrease your Aggro levels in the game. If you fire at the enemy they earn your attention and will attack you with full force allowing your partner go unnoticed so he can flank the enemies. <br /><br />There is a lot of <a data-ref-id="3015-55" href="/cover-system/3015-55/">                                     cover</a> in the game and the player is encouraged to use cover as much as possible to avoid getting shot. If you sustain too much damage your character will "go down." This brings to light another tactic: When you are downed you can still shoot to defend yourself but you will eventually bleed out if your partner can't rescue you in time. Your partner must drag you to safety in order to heal you or they risk getting shot themselves. Only in a "safe" environment is it advisable to heal your partner. There is also another tactic called, "Overkill". If your partner fills the entire bar of Aggro for a set amount of time it gets activated. The player that gained the Aggro will go into an aggressive mode where bullets do <a data-ref-id="3015-3195" href="/double-damage/3015-3195/">                                    twice the damage</a>, but he walks slower as a result and the other partner is placed in a stealth mode and is able to run swiftly and take enemies out with melee attacks with ease.<br /><br /><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2287/576598-artwp3050.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-576598" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2287/576598-artwp3050.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-576598"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2287/576598-artwp3050.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2287/576598-artwp3050.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption> Dalton, your CO as a Ranger and soon after, your boss at SSC.</figcaption></figure>     You need the help of your partner to do a number of other tasks to progress such as step jumps which allow you to climb obstacles that weren't possible before. There are some instances where you and your partner need each other in combat tactics such as co-op snipe which sees both you and your partner take out guards simultaneously. You can <a data-ref-id="3015-1062" href="/weapons-swap/3015-1062/">                                   swap weapons</a> if you run out of ammo and your partner can spare something.

Primary weapons are the types you will generally be using the most. Secondaries are, as expected, ideal for back-up when you need it during a firefight.

Players were allowed to upgrade and modify their weapons to a previously unseen degree. Weapons can be outfitted with larger magazines, longer barrels, and other alterations. None of the alterations are produced by real manufacturers, but weapon statistics can be heavily altered by different attachments. You can also change the weapon appearance between 'Normal' and 'Pimped', for the sum of $10,000. Pimped versions of the weapons are bright gold or platinum and can generate much more Aggro. Even with the MP7, which cannot be modified, the appearance can be Pimped. Many players chose to use Pimped weapons as much as possible due to the increased production of Aggro that a bright gold weapon produces. The M134 minigun can, somehow, be made bright gold as well.<br /><h2>Online</h2> Unusually, Army of Two is well known for having extremely restrictive online play. PAL region copies can not be used in matches with NTSC copies of the game, and so on. European copies of the game are identified on the <a data-ref-id="3015-1404" href="/xbox-live/3015-1404/">       Xbox LIVE </a>service as 'Army of Two [EU]', while NTSC copies of the game are identified simply as 'Army of Two'.<b> </b>This is arguably the reason the online modes in Army of Two were not as successful as they could have been.<b> </b><br /><b> </b><br />The online aspect of Army of Two is quite different to that of other games. It is similar to the 'Mafiya Work' modes in <a data-ref-id="3030-20457" href="/grand-theft-auto-iv/3030-20457/">      Grand Theft Auto IV</a>, in the sense that you are tasked with completing objectives around the battlefield and eliminating other players. Some objectives may task you with escorting a VIP, or killing a target, but you must do so with the other players all breathing down your neck. Some maps also contain vehicles, which can be used to gain an edge, at the risk of being a larger target. Weapons are not 'unlocked', as such; instead, players are able to spend earned money during a match to get weapons. These weapons are yours for the rest of the match, and they come in 'Packs'. Each pack contains a different mixture of weapons, and as you scroll through them, they grow more powerful, but also more expensive. The final pack is Gun Pack 8, which costs a considerable fortune and contains some insane firepower.<br /> <br />There is also an additional DLC pack that includes other game modes as well as levels: The SSC Challenger Pack. This is where two teams compete in training exercises where they focus on accuracy of targets as well as being able to finish obstacle courses the quickest. Teamwork and co-operation, once again, is the key to success. <br /><h2>Soundtrack</h2><ol><li>Lock N' Load</li> <li>Somalia</li> <li>Secret Mission</li> <li>Storming the Compound</li> <li>The Strategy</li> <li>Enemy Territory</li> <li>Invasion</li> <li>Ready for Battle</li> <li>In a Foreign Land</li> <li>Iraq</li> <li>The Desolate Land</li> <li>Miami</li> <li>US Army Rangers</li> <li>On the Move</li> <li>Gun Battle</li> <li>Victory is the Only Option</li> <li>Village Siege</li> <li>Behind Enemy Lines</li> <li>In the Factory</li> <li>Escape</li> <li>Strange Land</li> <li>The Unknown</li> <li>Hunting the Enemy</li> <li>Blasted Away</li> <li>The Pursuit<br /></li> <li>Desert Winds</li> <li>Dead or Alive</li> <li>The Canals</li> <li>The Village</li> <li>Undercover Operation</li> <li>Take Em' Down</li> <li>Don't Breathe</li> <li>Combat Zone</li> </ol> <br /><h2>Graphic Novel<br /></h2>Before the release of Army of Two, a special graphic novel was produced, entitled 'Dirty Money'. The graphic novel follows the characters of Salem and Rios on early missions for SSC, and can be considered as canon. However, none of the events displayed in the novel are referenced in-game. The graphic novel also charts how the two men became friendly with <a data-ref-id="3035-664" href="/korea/3035-664/">     Korean</a> arms dealer Cha-Min Soo, who sells Special Weapons in-game. According to the novel, the men rescued Soo's son after a drug deal went horribly wrong. This could explain why Cha-Min Soo is prepared to provide the Army of Two with <i>anything</i> they need: up to, and including, a cargo plane, which they use during the final assault in Miami.<br /><h2>Xbox 360 Game Installation</h2>Army of Two requires 5.0GB of space to install on an <a data-ref-id="3045-20" href="/xbox-360/3045-20/">    Xbox 360</a> HDD. <br /><h2>Xbox 360 Games on Demand<br /></h2>On October 20, 2009, Army of Two became available on the Xbox 360's <a data-ref-id="3015-3251" href="/games-on-demand/3015-3251/">                                                    Games on Demand</a> service.

The game features numerous quick time events (looking especially well during the boss battles) and limited character development. Beowulf can fight with different weapons with 2 attack buttons (as he can collect new ones during his quest), grapple the enemies (what may be followed by disarming, throwing or beating them up in several ways). Some of the most bloody moves can be performed when the protagonist enters the carnal power mode, which gives him a temporary damage boost. Beowulf has a group of Thanes under his command and he can give them simple orders such as: open, follow, boost. The game also features several rhythm game segments (e.g. completing a song succesfully speeds up opening the door or is necessary in order to lure Grendel). The hero is pitted against regular-sized enemies, as well as bigger creatures (trolls) and large boss characters - each enemy type can be finished in various bloody ways.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/106662/1681702-beowulf__10_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1681702" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/106662/1681702-beowulf__10_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1681702"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/106662/1681702-beowulf__10_.jpg"></a><figcaption>Hey, it's almost Angie!</figcaption></figure><p style="">The story is divided into three parts. In the first one players play as young Beowulf from racing Brecca (what was mentioned in the movie as well) to the point where Beowulf becomes a king after defeating Grendel and meeting his mother. The second part enables players to live through the period that was not covered in the movie and features several missions as a young king.

The remaining population devolves into chaos and lawlessness much akin to a <a href="../../mad-max-rockatansky/94-5918/" rel="nofollow">Mad Max</a> style world. While some of the settlers seek the alien technology, most are simply struggling to survive. Now, seven earth years after the first landfall on Pandora, the planet's slow orbit brings a transition from "winter" to "spring", and many horrifying creatures emerge from hibernation, making the <a href="../../planet/93-572/" rel="nofollow">planet</a> even more hostile. The game begins as a group of four mysterious offworlders, represented by the four <a href="../../classes/92-405/" rel="nofollow">character classes</a>, arrive on Pandora to seek their fortunes as Treasure Hunters seeking the Vault.</p><h2>Character Classes</h2><h3>Roland, the Soldier</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11203/1050189-roland.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1050189" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="1.8540145985401" data-width="274" style="width: 274px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:185.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11203/1050189-roland.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1050189"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11203/1050189-roland.jpg"></a><figcaption>Roland, the Soldier</figcaption></figure><p style="">Main page: <a href="../../roland/94-11164/" rel="nofollow">Roland</a></p><p style="">He is a former soldier of the Crimson Lance, an elite private <a href="../../military/92-1009/" rel="nofollow">military</a> group working for the Atlas Corporation. Roland's Infantry, Support and Medical branches of his skill tree include generating new ammo for both himself and those in his party, increasing his clip capacity and the party's health regeneration. Roland can gain the ability to shoot 'healing' bullets (grenades and rockets also included), which will damage his enemies, but heal his allies. His class specific skill is the deployment of a turret with a shield barrier, which can attack enemies or heal allies within range. Being at least proficient with all weapons, both long range and short, and having a robust health bar, Roland is considered to be the all-round supportive unit.</p><h3>Mordecai, the Hunter</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11203/1050187-mordecai.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1050187" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="1.8242811501597" data-width="313" style="width: 313px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:182.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11203/1050187-mordecai.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1050187"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11203/1050187-mordecai.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11203/1050187-mordecai.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Mordecai, the Hunter</figcaption></figure><p style="">Main page: <a href="../../mordecai/94-11163/" rel="nofollow">Mordecai</a></p><p style="">Mordecai came to Pandora to find a man named Demosthenes.

Mordecai can also be deadly with a <a href="../../pistol/93-59/" rel="nofollow">pistol</a> if specialized in the Gunslinger skill tree. Mordecai's class specific skill is his pet Bloodwing, which he can periodically call upon to damage or outright kill his enemies.

This is good news for anyone who played <a href="../../fallout-3/61-20504/" rel="nofollow">Fallout 3</a> or <a href="../../hellgate-london/61-9989/" rel="nofollow">Hellgate: London</a> and was frustrated by the dice rolls dictating damage and accuracy. They've referred to the game as a " <a href="../../role-playing-shooter/92-3938/" rel="nofollow">role-playing shooter</a>."</p><h3>Character Progression</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17015/1451674-borderlands_2010_07_28_19_38_46_51.png" data-ref-id="1300-1451674" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17015/1451674-borderlands_2010_07_28_19_38_46_51.png" data-ref-id="1300-1451674"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/17015/1451674-borderlands_2010_07_28_19_38_46_51.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/17015/1451674-borderlands_2010_07_28_19_38_46_51.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Nearly everything gives XP and drops loot in Borderlands.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Characters <a href="../../leveling-up/92-475/" rel="nofollow">level up</a> as they kill enemies and deliver quests. But if a player "grinds" in a area that is too far below his/her own level they will only gain 1 XP per enemy. The original leveling was <a href="../../level-cap/92-3025/" rel="nofollow">capped</a> at 50. The third DLC pack, <a href="reviews/?review_id=265" rel="nofollow">The Secret Armory of General Knoxx</a>, increased the cap to 61 - which was eventually changed to 69 in a free patch for everyone. With each new level, players may assign points to character attributes and skills. Upon reaching level five, each class will gain access to a class-specific skill (e.g. Roland's turret or Mordecai's Bloodwing). Moving forward from level five, players may progress through their skill trees choosing one of three paths to further enhance existing skills, and gain access to new ones. A max level character will have earned 46 points for spending in the skill tree -- 1 to gain access to the action skill and 45 to place as the player chooses among other skills.</p><h3>Weapon Proficiency</h3><p style="">In addition to skill advancement chosen by the player upon leveling, weapons skills are also advanced based on usage. These weapon skills give bonuses to reload time, stability, damage, rate of fire, cool-down rate and accuracy, depending on which weapon that the player is using.</p><h3>Character Customization</h3><p style="">Aesthetic customization is present, although it is limited to setting armor and clothing colors. The base appearance of characters is static; all Berserkers will appear as Brick and all Hunters will appear as Mordecai, for example. Of course, players will also see the unique models of any guns that may be equipped.</p><h3>Loot</h3><p style="">The game has garnered comparisons to <a href="../../diablo/61-5985/" rel="nofollow">Diablo</a> for its inclusion of a plethora of procedurally-generated weapons. Some enemies will drop <a href="../../random-loot/92-365/" rel="nofollow">loot</a>. In true medieval RPG fashion, <a href="../../treasure-chest/93-517/" rel="nofollow">treasure chests</a> also appear throughout the world, albeit in more appropriate forms. In addition to guns, players will happen upon <a href="../../grenade/93-111/" rel="nofollow">grenade</a> mods, <a href="../../shield-regeneration/92-2349/" rel="nofollow">shields</a>, artifacts, and class mods which will grant a boost to the character's skills. <a href="../../vending-machine/93-200/" rel="nofollow">Vending machines</a> are available to facilitate the buying and selling of loot. When players look at a dropped piece of loot, a box pops up providing vital information about that item. Loot is also color-coded based on how common it is a la Diablo, the color coding rarity scheme is as follows, from least to greatest: White, Green, Blue, Purple, Yellow, Orange, Dark Orange, Pearl. (The Pearlescent color is a very light shade of blue, not to be confused with White guns).</p><h3>Quests</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1670743-borderlands_2010_12_30_06_30_47_91.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1670743" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1670743-borderlands_2010_12_30_06_30_47_91.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1670743"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3661/1670743-borderlands_2010_12_30_06_30_47_91.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3661/1670743-borderlands_2010_12_30_06_30_47_91.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>A large number of quests revolve around audio-logs.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The game contains 160 quests. These are composed of 30 quests in the mainline story and 130 <a href="../../side-quests/92-338/" rel="nofollow">side quests</a>. Most quests will be taken from <a href="../../non-player-character/92-967/" rel="nofollow">NPCs</a> and bounty boards in the games various towns and settlements. In addition to quests, the game includes repeatable scenarios complete with bosses that may be farmed for loot and experience.</p><p style="">Once the main storyline quests are complete, there is an option to <a href="/new-game-plus/3015-150/" data-ref-id="3015-150">New Game +</a> the game with another playthrough, resulting in tougher enemies and a reset of all quests to higher level, awarding more experience points (though character progression and weapons remain).</p><h3>Co-op</h3><p style="">Borderlands features <a href="../../4-player-co-op/92-2563/" rel="nofollow">four-player co-op</a> online and two-player <a href="../../split-screen-multiplayer/92-322/" rel="nofollow">local co-op</a> in the console versions. The co-op allows for a persistent character to hop from one co-op game to another while keeping all the equipment and experience earned in a previous game. Progress in quests and the storyline, however, is confined to the game world of the player hosting the game. Difficulty scales based on the number of player characters participating. Play with more players and more enemies will spawn in the world. Money and experience rewarded for kills are divided evenly amongst players. Loot and ammo, however, belongs to whoever gets there first.</p><p style="">The game also includes player versus player combat. In co-op, players can also challenge each other to a duel. One player melees another, and if they melee back a dome will form around them and they can battle it out. In addition, arenas can be found around the world where players can fight each other.</p><p style="">Some players have figured out how to hack the loot system in borderlands, as some players may find while online. The best example of this is the Omega Rose shield. It makes the player nearly invincible with a high shield rating well above what any other shield will provide. It is not in the game, players have hacked the loot system to make the shield. With the release of the very difficult add-on of the Armory of General Knoxx, this shield has been showing up more as with even a high level and top of the line shield, death can come very quickly.</p><h3>Weapons</h3><p style="">One of the big draws of Borderlands is the promise of millions of guns that are all unique, generated procedurally. During the <a href="../../e3-2008/92-3499/" rel="nofollow">E3 2008</a> gameplay <a href="../../demo/92-1641/" rel="nofollow">demo</a>, Gearbox stated that each of the game's weapons manufacturers have rules and materials that define what’s available for them to use to create the weapons. The developers of Borderlands created a program that generates weapons based on a set of rules. According to Game Informer, <a href="../../randy-pitchford/72-4430/" rel="nofollow">Randy Pitchford</a> reported that the last weapon count for the game was an astronomical 17,750,000.</p><h3>Traversing the Landscape</h3><p style="">Designated spawn points throughout the world allow players to summon a vehicle, otherwise known as " <a href="../../catch-a-ride/92-4663/" rel="nofollow">Catch-A-Ride</a>!". Players will be able to customize various vehicles with one of two different weapons ( <a href="../../rocket-launcher/93-211/" rel="nofollow">rocket launcher</a> or <a href="../../machine-gun/93-608/" rel="nofollow">machine gun</a>) and paint jobs. This is one of two preferred traveling methods the other being the now familiar <a href="../../fast-travel/92-676/" rel="nofollow">fast travel</a> system that allows for instant <a href="../../teleportation/92-8/" rel="nofollow">teleporting</a> between locations once they have been unlocked. Players will gain access to vehicles relatively early in the game with the fast travel system opening up later.</p><h3>Challenges</h3><p style="">In addition to <a href="../../achievements/92-29/" rel="nofollow">achievements</a> and trophies, Borderlands has an in-game <a href="../../challenges/92-1925/" rel="nofollow">challenge</a> system. The challenges are structured like achievements or trophies; however, they are separate from those systems and reward characters with experience upon completion.</p><h3>Death</h3><p style="">Borderlands utilizes the <a href="../../down-but-not-out/92-4335/" rel="nofollow">down but not out</a> concept. When <a href="../../health/92-130/" rel="nofollow">health</a> reaches zero, players will be immobilized and slowly "bleed out" as the screen loses contrast; however, weapons can still be fired. Teammates have the ability to revive fallen allies. If players achieve a kill in this wounded state, a "second wind" will be awarded, this will instantly revive the character with full shields. However, if a character cannot be revived, they will spawn at the nearest New-U station for a fee. The fee is a percentage of the player's total cash on hand. The percentage for respawning at a New-U station is between 10% and 14.3% averaging at 14.29%. Players can never go into negative money, so if a player has no money the fee is waived.</p><h2>Skills</h2><h3>Action skills</h3><p style="">Each character has only one single Action Skill, which is earned at level 5. This is the first skill to be learned and all the others derive from it. Further developing skills will also improve that action skill. All action skills are temporary.</p><ul><li><b>Mordecai</b> - Mordecai's action skill allows him to unleash a bird of prey called Bloodwing unto his enemies.</li><li><b>Lilith</b> - Lilith's action skill is the Phasewalk. When using it, she becomes temporarily invisible and moves faster as well as damages enemies within the area the skill is activated.</li><li><b>Roland</b> - Roland's action skill deploys a Scorpio Turret, which attacks enemies while providing cover, since the base of the turret projects an energy shield towards the area of fire.</li><li><b>Brick</b> - Brick's action skill makes him go Berserk. While under its effect, Brick's vision becomes clouded with blood, he laughs frantically, puts away his firearms uses his fists to pummel through enemies. His melee damage is significantly increased, he takes a lot less damage from any sort of attacks, and even regenerates health during battle.</li></ul><h3>Skill trees</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1565660-mordecai.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1565660" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.68" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:68.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1565660-mordecai.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1565660"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1565660-mordecai.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1565660-mordecai.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Mordecai's Skill Tree.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Each class has three different groups of skills within his/her tree skill, which in turn are divided into 4 sub-groups each.

time when there was still much to be done to finish other aspects of the game, the Borderlands art team found themselves with little left to do. They made a plea to <a href="../../randall-s-pitchford-ii/72-4430/" rel="nofollow">Randy Pitchford</a> and others to develop a distinctive graphical style more closely mirroring the style of their <a href="../../concept-art/92-3763/" rel="nofollow">concept artwork</a>. There was some skepticism over making such a large change at such a late stage in development. The art team was asked to develop a prototype of this new art style without the knowledge of Pitchford. When the prototype was shown, it was decided that this distinctive new art style was a must for the final game. These events led to the retooling of Borderlands into what we have today.</p><p style="">Pitchford was quoted as saying that the PC version "destroys" the consoles in terms of graphics. However, the PC version shipped with a host of issues such as crashes, quests not finishing properly, and buggy netcode.</p><h2>Pandora's Geography</h2><p style="">There are six main areas in the game, those being:</p><ul><li><b>Arid Badlands</b></li><li><b>Dahl Headlands</b></li><li><b>New Haven</b></li><li><b>Rust Commons West</b></li><li><b>Rust Commons East</b></li><li><b>Salt

Predictably, the story of the DLC (which is implied to be something the Narrator made up) involves the vault hunters traveling to a remote island, the home of one <a href="/dr-ned/3005-13494/" data-ref-id="3005-13494">Dr. Ned</a>, who has unleashed an army of undead abominations upon the good people who live there. The island includes new quests, new dungeons, a few new areas to explore, new enemies to kill, and has around 4-6 hours of new content to explore. The expansion allows players to visit a Jakobs Weapons Factory, and learn more about the weapon manufacturers, as well as what went wrong with the island and cause it to be overrun by zombies in the first place. Players can teleport to the island from a New-U station, as long as they are level 10 or above, and the area difficulty will scale accordingly.</p><h3>Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/1213893-dlc2_launch_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1213893" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/1213893-dlc2_launch_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1213893"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33529/1213893-dlc2_launch_1.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33529/1213893-dlc2_launch_1.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Roland fights off waves of enemies.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The second DLC for Borderlands, titled Mad Moxxi' s Underdome Riot, was released on December 29th, 2009 for Xbox 360, and January 7th, 2010 for PS3 and PC. The central premise for this DLC is a type of <a href="../../horde/92-3021/" rel="nofollow">horde mode</a>, which has the player(s) participating in arena tournaments hosted by <a href="../../mad-moxxi/94-13441/" rel="nofollow">Mad Moxxi</a>. Players battle against waves of enemies whilst subject to "Moxxi's Maxims," which are rules that will slightly alter the gameplay (for instance providing a bonus to grenade damage). There are two main types of tournaments featured; medium-length tournaments that will take approximately an hour to complete, and a hardcore tournament lasting up to 6 hours that must be completed in one sitting. Players are given three arenas to fight in. The DLC also includes a bank to store items, as well as two skill points as a quest reward. Unlike the main game and other expansions, players do not gain experience, weapon proficiency, weapons, or money from killing enemies.

past.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2>Based on Robert Ludlum's series of Bourne books, the Bourne Conspiracy was developed by High Moon Studios. It follows and expands on the story of the movies, and attempts to mirror the shaky-cam look they possessed, but it does not feature Matt Damon as Jason Bourne. It was released on June 3, 2008.<br/><br/> <h2>Story</h2> <figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2287/840470-rlbcp3014.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-840470" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.56256684491979" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2287/840470-rlbcp3014.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-840470"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2287/840470-rlbcp3014.jpg"></a><figcaption>Jason Bourne doing work.</figcaption></figure>Following the story of the movie, the game starts the player as Jason Bourne, on a mission to assassinate Nykwana Wombosi, a former African dictator. As Bourne approaches him, he realizes he can't kill him because Wombosi's children are present. Jason attempts to escape the boat but is shot in the back and falls into the ocean. He is found by a fishing trawler some time later, and finds out that he has amnesia but that he is somehow able to perform uncommon tasks such as speaking several languages and being very skilled and hand-to-hand combat. Bourne finds a small laser pointer  that points him to the bank of Zurich, but when he shows up, the bank guards try to arrest him. It seems that the US government is now hunting him. Now Bourne must avoid the global drag net, while trying to piece together his past and the reason he is being hunted.<br/><br/>The game essentially follows <i>The Bourne Identity</i> film, but also changes things up by adding sequences that were not present during the movie. These scenes all involve Bourne while he was still a fully functional thirty-million dollar weapon, in the employ of the secret government agency known as Treadstone. These sequences are activated whenever Bourne finds some item that jogs his memory such as a passport or a newspaper. <br/> <br/> <h2>Levels that are not part of the movie </h2><h3>Dangerous Beginnings</h3>This level shows Bourne running through Marseille, trying to neutralize one of Wombosi's men, a bomber.  <br/> <br/><h3>Shipyard Infiltration</h3>Bourne tries to board Wombosi's boat, and must fight a helicopter and Wombosi's personal bodyguard. <br/> <br/><h3>Eliminate Divandelen</h3>In this flashback mission, Bourne must eliminate a prisoner named Divandelen, who's being transported by Swiss officers to the airport so he can be extracted from the country. However, Divandelen's terrorist group sets him free and Bourne chases after him through an airport, a subway, a runway and finally kills him in a flying plane. <br/> <h3>Silence Rurik</h3>Bourne must assassinate a Russian terrorist which he does by shooting him in the face than escaping the university he was hiding in.<br/><br/> <h2>Gameplay</h2> <figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2287/840494-rlbcp3034.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-840494" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2287/840494-rlbcp3034.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-840494"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2287/840494-rlbcp3034.jpg"></a><figcaption>Some hand-to-hand combat.</figcaption></figure>The gameplay features hand-to-hand combat and weaponized objects styled after the action sequences in the films, and gun battles with government agents and commandos. There is also a vehicular sequence where you are driving through the streets of Paris while evading law enforcement.  <br/>During <a data-ref-id="3015-865" href="/close-quarters-combat/3015-865/" slug="close-quarters-combat">      close combat</a> an adrenaline meter fills up as the player successfully lands hits, once the meter fills he can perform a special attack that features Bourne delivering a violent set of blows to his opponent, often contextual to the immediate environment around them. There are three levels of adrenaline attacks: the higher the meter, the more opponents you can take down. At the third level, Bourne can dispatch three enemies one after the other, or if you are surrounded you can take them out all at once with a series of timed button presses.  Additionally, there is a feature called Bourne Instinct, which can be activated by pressing the Y or Triangle button. This <a data-ref-id="3015-3853" href="/special-vision/3015-3853/" slug="special-vision"> shows the player</a> where enemies are on the map, as well as aspects of the environment that can be interacted with.<br/> <h2>Reception </h2>While the game received accolades for its story and melée combat, overall reviews were mixed. It was nominated for two Gamespot awards: <i>Most Surprisingly Good Game of 2008</i>, and <i>Best Boss Fights</i>.]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>20488</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/2154889-box_tbc.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/2154889-box_tbc.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/2154889-box_tbc.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/2154889-box_tbc.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/2154889-box_tbc.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2154889-box_tbc.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/2154889-box_tbc.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Robert Ludlum's The Bourne Conspiracy]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>25</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-1/]]></api_detail_url><id>1</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: T]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-2/]]></api_detail_url><id>2</id><name><![CDATA[PEGI: 16+]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-12/]]></api_detail_url><id>12</id><name><![CDATA[OFLC: MA15+]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2008-06-03 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/robert-ludlums-the-bourne-conspiracy/3030-20488/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20497/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-05-15 15:16:20</date_added><date_last_updated>2015-08-07 01:16:57</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[Use your glaive to chop off your enemies' heads in this third-person action-shooter from D3 and Digital Extremes.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Dark Sector was developed by <a href="/digital-extremes/3010-2159/" data-ref-id="3010-2159">Digital Extremes</a> for the <a href="/xbox-360/3045-20/" data-ref-id="3045-20">Xbox 360</a> and <a href="/playstation-3/3045-35/" data-ref-id="3045-35">PlayStation 3</a> and was released on March 25, 2008 through <a href="/d3-publisher-inc/3010-895/" data-ref-id="3010-895">D3 Publisher</a>. It was released on the <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC</a> a year later, published by <a href="/aspyr-media-inc/3010-388/" data-ref-id="3010-388">Aspyr Media</a>. Originally planned to feature a sci-fi setting with the main character being a man in an advanced armored suit, it was later changed to a more realistic setting in military bases, abandoned towns, and other grittier environments . The developers stated that this was because of other developers and publishers shifting their attention to more realistic settings. Gameplay revolves around <a href="/cover-system/3015-55/" data-ref-id="3015-55">cover</a>, third-person shooting, and the use of a bladed projectile weapon called the <a href="/glaive/3055-927/" data-ref-id="3055-927">glaive</a>.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">The glaive can be used at the same time as one-handed guns. Throwing the glaive can stun enemies, setting them up for melee finishing moves; with enough accumulated damage, the glaive can also dismember foes, killing them immediately even if only a limb is severed. Hayden's disease mutates over time, resulting in new abilities as the story progresses. One of these new powers is the ability to perform charged up "power throws". These power throws will decapitate most minor enemies in one hit. Soon after learning power throws, Hayden obtains "aftertouch", allowing him to directly control the path of the glaive in mid-flight. The glaive can also absorb the "elements" such as fire, ice, and electricity for improved combat abilities as well as involvement in the game's <a href="/puzzles/3015-932/" data-ref-id="3015-932">puzzle-solving</a>. It also serves as a boomerang, capable of collecting items that are too far for Hayden to reach.</p><p style="">There is also a heavy amount of gunplay. The shooting is reminiscent of <a href="/gears-of-war/3030-12231/" data-ref-id="3030-12231">Gears of War</a>, with a similar <a href="/over-the-shoulder/3015-2621/" data-ref-id="3015-2621">over-the-shoulder</a> perspective and <a href="/cover-system/3015-55/" data-ref-id="3015-55">cover system</a>. However, there is no <a href="/blind-fire/3015-612/" data-ref-id="3015-612">blind fire</a>, increasing the importance of the glaive because it is capable of killing enemies while Hayden is still taking cover. There are also collectible upgrades throughout the game's chapters, which can be added to the guns during visits to the black market. Upgrades are permanent and take up limited slots on each gun.</p><h2>Story</h2><h3>Main Characters</h3><h4><b>Hayden Tenno</b></h4><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/727/398833-dark_sector_art_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-398833" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.94458438287154" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:94.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/727/398833-dark_sector_art_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-398833"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/727/398833-dark_sector_art_04.jpg"></a></figure><p style="">Dark Sector's protagonist who is infected with the Technocyte virus, giving him his unique in game abilities, is out to stop the spread of the virus across the world</p><h4><b>Robert Mezner</b></h4><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11097/850893-menzer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-850893" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.3944444444444" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:139.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11097/850893-menzer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-850893"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11097/850893-menzer.jpg"></a></figure><p style="">Dark Sector's <a href="/antagonist/3015-1070/" data-ref-id="3015-1070">antagonist</a> is also infected with the Technocyte virus.

She and Hayden were once romantically involved, but the story does not elaborate upon it.</p><h4><b>Viktor</b></h4><p style="">An agent similar to Hayden also working for the agency. Hayden's initial mission is to find Viktor, who is believed to be infected, and murder him. His relevance to the story is extremely minor.</p><h4><b>The Black Market Dealer</b></h4><p style="">The game's dealer sets up shop in sewers accessible through various manholes; he allows the player to buy, sell and upgrade weapons. The character shares similarities to <a href="/the-merchant/3005-1411/" data-ref-id="3005-1411">The Merchant</a>, a character from <a href="/resident-evil-4/3030-1578/" data-ref-id="3030-1578">Resident Evil 4.</a></p><h3>Plot</h3><p style="">The story begins with <a href="/">Hayden Tenno</a>, an operative from an unnamed United States agency (the game's multiplayer simply refers to it as "The Agency"), on a mission in the fictional Eastern European nation of Lasria. He possesses a disease called congenital analgia which mostly nullifies his ability to feel pain. Hayden kills a captured U.S. agent named Viktor, because he is believed to be infected by the Technocyte Virus, a disease that transforms its victims into powerful abominations, and then pursues a man named <a href="/robert-mezner/3005-9137/" data-ref-id="3005-9137">Mezner</a>. Mezner is the man responsible for unleashing the virus in the first place. The mutation process is so painful that it usually drives the infected insane. As Hayden tracks down Mezner, he meets the Nemesis, an imposing, gladiator-esque creature in an armoured suit. After a brief fight Hayden is defeated and infected, but due to his disease, he does not feel the agonizing pain to the extent that others do, and so he is not driven into madness. He remains mostly in control of himself and his thoughts, able to use the disease to his advantage. Hayden sets out to find Mezner and stop the spread of the virus.</p><h2>Weapons and Upgrades</h2><p style="">Throughout Dark Sector the player is able to purchase new weapons and find new upgrades.</p><h3>Sidearms</h3><h4><a href="/tekna-9mm/3055-3583/" data-ref-id="3055-3583">Tekna 9mm</a></h4><ul><li><strong>Ammo:</strong> Pistol</li><li><strong>Round Capacity:</strong> 12</li><li><strong>Price:</strong> 9000 Rubles</li><li><strong>First Available:</strong> Chapter One</li></ul><h4>Tekna Burst</h4><ul><li><strong>Ammo</strong>: Pistol</li><li><strong>Round Capacity</strong>: 26</li><li><strong>Price</strong>: 10500 Rubles</li><li><strong>First Available</strong>: Chapter Four</li></ul><h4>Vekesk Micro</h4><ul><li><strong>Ammo:</strong> Machine Gun</li><li><strong>Round Capacity:</strong> 30</li><li><strong>Price:</strong> 21000 Rubles</li><li><strong>First Available:</strong> Chapter Four</li></ul><h4><b>Spectre</b></h4><ul><li><strong>Ammo:</strong> Shotgun</li><li><strong>Round Capacity:</strong> 2</li><li><strong>Price:</strong> 28000 Rubles</li><li><strong>First Available:</strong> Chapter Six</li></ul><h4><b>Hammer 1895</b></h4><ul><li><strong>Ammo:</strong> Magnum</li><li><strong>Round Capacity:</strong> 6</li><li><strong>Price:</strong> 32000 Rubles</li><li><strong>First Available:</strong> Chapter Six</li></ul><h3>Assault Weapons</h3><h4>AKS-74</h4><ul><li><strong>Ammo:</strong> Machine Gun</li><li><strong>Round Capacity:</strong> 30</li><li><strong>Price:</strong> 20000 Rubles</li><li><strong>First Available:</strong> Chapter Four</li></ul><h4>Striker</h4><ul><li><strong>Ammo:</strong> Shotgun</li><li><strong>Round Capacity:</strong> 6</li><li><strong>Price:</strong> 26000 Rubles</li><li><strong>First Available:</strong> Chapter Four</li></ul><h4>Protecta</h4><ul><li><strong>Ammo:</strong> Shotgun</li><li><strong>Round Capacity:</strong> 12</li><li><strong>Price:</strong> 39000 Rubles</li><li><strong>First Available:</strong> Chapter Five</li></ul><h4><b>VX Carbine</b></h4><ul><li><strong>Ammo:</strong> Magnum</li><li><strong>Round Capacity:</strong> 6</li><li><strong>Price:</strong> 30000 Rubles</li><li><strong>First Available:</strong> Chapter Five</li></ul><h4>Korbov TK6</h4><ul><li><strong>Ammo:</strong> Machine Gun</li><li><strong>Round Capacity:</strong> 30</li><li><strong>Price:</strong> 40000</li><li><strong>First Available:</strong> Chapter Seven</li></ul><h3>Special Weapons</h3><h4>RPG</h4><ul><li>Ammo: RPGs</li><li><strong>Round Capacity:</strong> 4</li><li><strong>Price:</strong> This item cannot be purchased.

Dropped by enemies.</li><li><strong>First Available:</strong> Chapter One</li></ul><h3>Weapon Upgrades</h3><p style="">Upgrades can be found hidden throughout the game in aluminum suitcases.</p><h4><b>Accuracy</b></h4><p style=""><strong>Available to:</strong> Everything</p><p style="">This upgrade decreases the size of your guns accuracy circle. Although it does not shrink it past the guns normal maximum accuracy point. Using your glaive with after touch completely removes the necessity of this upgrade.</p><h4>Double Shot</h4><p style=""><strong>Available to:</strong> Everything</p><p style="">The Double Shot upgrade makes each gun fire twice in one shot. This upgrade can be deadly when used with a shotgun or magnum weapon.</p><h4>Fire Rate</h4><p style=""><strong>Available to:</strong> Everything</p><p style="">This upgrade does exactly what is sounds like it would do. It increases the firing speed of a weapon. It helps on slower pistols and shotguns, but generally is not necessarily needed.</p><h4>Reload Speed</h4><p style=""><strong>Available to:</strong> Everything</p><p style="">Reload Speed allows you to reload your weapon faster then normal. Except for the fact that Hayden already reloads all of his guns at a fast pace, it would be a better idea to just sell this upgrade for money.</p><h4>Puncture</h4><p style=""><strong>Available to:</strong> Magnum</p><p style="">This allows bullets to pass through an enemy and into one directly behind him. This upgrade is generally pointless when you have your glaive that can do the same thing for free. It would again be a better idea to sell this upgrade instead of using it.</p><h4><b>Stopping Power</b></h4><p style=""><strong>Available to:</strong> Shotgun, Magnum</p><p style="">This upgrade allows your shots to knock enemies over allowing you to shoot them more. This upgrade does not cause any more damage to the enemy.</p><p style=""><b>Enferon Shells</b></p><p style=""><strong>Available to:</strong> Everything</p><p style="">Enferon Shells are a rare upgrade in the game and should be used carefully. The upgrade coats your ammunition in Enferon and is highly affective on the infected. A few shots will cause them to swell up and die of convulsions (after around 10 seconds).</p><h4>Clip Extender</h4><p style=""><strong>Available to:</strong> Everything</p><p style="">This upgrade will extend your ammo capacity by 25%. On longarms it is stackable up to 100% (using four upgrades) and on sidearms only to 75%. The only exception to this rule as pointed out by others is the Spectre which only gets one extra shell.</p><h4>Firepower</h4><p style=""><strong>Available to:</strong> Everything</p><p style="">Firepower is an extremley rare upgrade with only four scattered through the game. They will increase the firepower strength of your weapon.</p><h4>Upgrade Slot</h4><p style=""><strong>Available to:</strong> Everything</p><p style="">The rarest upgrade in the game which can only be found in timed levels of the game. It allows you to add one more upgrade slot to your weapon of choice (if that weapon is not already maxed out in upgrade slots).</p><h3>Technocyte Powers (Special Abilities)</h3><h4><b>Steal / Grab</b></h4><p style=""><strong>Achieved in:</strong> Chapter Two</p><p style="">Allows Hayden to use the glaive to grab items from a distance by throwing it at them.</p><h4><b>Power Throw</b></h4><p style=""><strong>Achieved in:</strong> Chapter Three</p><p style="">Allows the glaive to break special chains and locks. It also kills most enemies in one hit.</p><h4>After Touch</h4><p style=""><strong>Achieved in:</strong> Chapter Three</p><p style="">Lets the player control the movement of the glaive in slow motion.</p><h4>Shield</h4><p style=""><strong>Achieved in:</strong> Chapter Four</p><p style="">Generates a shield in front of Hayden which blocks most all attacks and deflects <a href="/projectile/3015-3/" data-ref-id="3015-3">projectiles</a> back in his facing direction.</p><h4>Energy Pulse</h4><p style=""><strong>Achieved in:</strong> Chapter Five</p><p style="">Allows Hayden to create an energy explosion with the glaive when it is thrown and charged with any elemental power (fire, electricity, and ice).</p><h4>Shift / Invisibility</h4><p style=""><strong>Achieved in:</strong> Chapter Seven</p><p style="">Turns Hayden invisible for a short period of time, allowing for stealth kills and bypassing some security systems. Invisibility automatically ends when the player attacks.</p><h2>Reclassification In Australia</h2><p style="">On Feburary 18th, 2008, Dark Sector was refused classification by the Office of Film &amp; Literature Classification board (OFLC), due to the games high-impact level of violence, and deemed unsuitable for audiences under the age of 18 years old. The OFLC stated:</p><blockquote data-size="small" data-align="center"><p style="">"The finishing moves and most violent game play includes decapitation, dismemberment of limbs accompanied by large blood spurts, neck breaking spurts, neck breaking twists and exploded bodies with post-action twitching body parts. These moves are relatively easy to accomplish and once the player has mastered the moves and is able to get close to his foes, these violent moves can be executed... Successfully shooting an opponent results in the depiction of blood spray. When Hayden cuts off his opponent's limb with the glaive, large amounts of blood spray forth from the stump and the injured person screams in agony which increases the impact."</p></blockquote><p style="">Dark Sector was later reclassified with MA15+ classification and released in Australia on October 9th 2008. Featuring no decapitations and toned down dismemberment on human opponents. This heavily censored version was based on the Japanese version, which was also slightly sanitised before its release.</p><h2>PC System Requirements</h2><ul><li><b>Operating System</b> Windows XP SP3, Vista SP1</li><li><b>CPU</b> Intel Dual Core 2.0 Ghz or AMD Athlon 4000</li><li><b>Memory</b> XP- 1 GB, Vista 2 GB</li><li><b>Hard Drive Space</b> 6.1 GB;

It then focuses on Goku's efforts against the <a href="/ginyu-force/3015-1630/" data-ref-id="3015-1630">Ginyu Force</a> and ultimately culminates with a duel between Goku and Frieza.</p><h3>Cell Saga</h3><p style="">The <a href="/cell/3005-447/" data-ref-id="3005-447">Cell</a> saga encompasses both the <a href="/android/3015-692/" data-ref-id="3015-692">android</a> saga and the cell games events.

Drama pieces are short cutscenes that play out during a battle once certain conditions are met. They often have effects on the status of characters, such as the increase or decrease of a character's <a href="/health/3015-130/" data-ref-id="3015-130">health</a>, defense, or <a href="/ki/3015-1642/" data-ref-id="3015-1642">ki</a>.</p><p style="">The game has a <a href="/campaign/3015-4011/" data-ref-id="3015-4011">story mode</a>, a versus mode, a trial challenge mode, and a <a href="/tutorial/3015-1085/" data-ref-id="3015-1085">tutorial</a>. The story mode is divided into certain sagas and ends before the <a href="/majin-buu/3005-2915/" data-ref-id="3005-2915">Majin Buu</a> saga.</p><h3>Versus</h3><p style="">In the versus mode players choose a partner before each fight who sometimes jump in and deliver an attack to their opponent just before leaving.</p><h3>Trial Chalenges</h3><p style="">Trial challenges ask players to win 100 matches without dying or finish ten matches within a time limit.</p><h3>Story mode</h3><p style="">Z Chronicles, the game's story mode differs from past games in that players don't choose the character they play as. Instead, players are commonly placed in the shoes of whatever character wins the major fights throughout the series.</p><p style="">Some of the more general gameplay changes include not being able to charge up ki energy. Rather, it fills up automatically during fights. Once full players can use aura spark, use ultimate attacks, and if available complete <a href="/transformations/3015-406/" data-ref-id="3015-406">transformations</a>.</p><p style="">Ultimate attacks are the game's equivalent of <a href="/special-attacks/3015-327/" data-ref-id="3015-327">special moves</a>. Each character has one or more, and chooses before each match in versus mode. It's not uncommon for a single ultimate attack to take away en entire bar of an opponent's health. Aura Spark lasts only a short while. It makes players stronger and allows them to knock their opponents into the air, initiating a short <a href="/minigames/3015-116/" data-ref-id="3015-116">minigame</a>. Both players must mash the face buttons to get their color (red or blue) to fill a bar on the bottom of the screen. The bar is divided into three sections. The players that starts the game has to get their color from the left to the right; the player on the receiving end must get their color from the right to the left. If both colors are in the middle then the minigame ends in a draw. If the players that starts it gets their color to the far end then they win and do quite a bit of damage to their opponent. However, the player that gets hit with this move can reverse it if they are fast enough.</p><h2>Credits</h2><ul><li>Japanese Voice : <a href="/goku/3005-441/" data-ref-id="3005-441"> Goku</a> -<a href="/masako-nozawa/3040-72195/" data-ref-id="3040-72195"> Masako Nozawa</a></li><li>Japanese Voice : Kid/Teen <a href="/gohan/3005-443/" data-ref-id="3005-443"> Gohan</a> -

Many others have felt that the game offers much less than those prior. It has less characters and moves available, all of which are unlocked after one playthrough. Something that was impossible in most of the previous games.</p><h2>Xbox 360 Game Installation</h2><p style="">Dragon Ball Z: Burst Limit requires 3.4GB of space to install on an <a href="/xbox-360/3045-20/" data-ref-id="3045-20">Xbox 360</a> HDD.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>20500</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/1/14036/824165-burstlimit_cover.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14036/824165-burstlimit_cover.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/1/14036/824165-burstlimit_cover.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14036/824165-burstlimit_cover.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/14036/824165-burstlimit_cover.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/14036/824165-burstlimit_cover.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/1/14036/824165-burstlimit_cover.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Dragon Ball Z: Burst Limit]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>20</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-1/]]></api_detail_url><id>1</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: T]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-25/]]></api_detail_url><id>25</id><name><![CDATA[CERO: A]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[BBFC: PG]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2008-06-10 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/dragon-ball-z-burst-limit/3030-20500/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20504/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-05-15 19:37:16</date_added><date_last_updated>2015-10-06 02:31:25</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[In Bethesda's first-person revival of the classic post-apocalyptic RPG series, the player is forced to leave Vault 101 and venture out into the irradiated wasteland of Washington D.C. to find his or her father.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Fallout 3 is the third game in the <a href="/fallout/3025-183/" data-ref-id="3025-183">Fallout</a> series and the first to feature a first person perspective. Developed and published by <a href="/bethesda-softworks/3010-786/" data-ref-id="3010-786">Bethesda Softworks</a>, it was released on October 28, 2008 on the <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC</a>, <a href="/xbox-360/3045-20/" data-ref-id="3045-20">Xbox 360</a> and <a href="/playstation-3/3045-35/" data-ref-id="3045-35">PlayStation 3</a>; the game takes place approximately thirty years after the events in <a href="/fallout-2/3030-5559/" data-ref-id="3030-5559">Fallout 2</a>. Although set in the same universe, Fallout 3 takes place in the <a href="/the-capital-wasteland/3035-2158/" data-ref-id="3035-2158">Capital Wasteland</a> in and around the <a href="/washington-dc/3035-255/" data-ref-id="3035-255">Washington D.C.</a> area, rather than California. The game blends design elements and approaches from both the Fallout and <a href="/elder-scrolls/3025-174/" data-ref-id="3025-174">Elder Scrolls</a> franchises, resulting in fan debate about Fallout 3's legitimacy as a "real" Fallout game.</p><p style="">Like <a href="/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/3030-20238/" data-ref-id="3030-20238">Oblivion</a>, enemies and items spawn relative to the player's current level. This keeps the difficulty of the game consistent, along with opening the majority of the game up to the player from the beginning. This is a change from the previous Fallout games, which featured zones that posed a huge risk to a low-level character if visited too early by the player. However, the system is markedly different from that of Oblivion in that, once an area is discovered, the environment is locked down to the level at which the player found it, preventing unrealistic jumps in enemy levels over the course of the game.</p><p style="">Bethesda supported the game post-release with a number of <a href="/downloadable-content/3015-329/" data-ref-id="3015-329">downloadable content</a> packs. Most of the pieces took place outside of the <a href="/the-wasteland/3035-777/" data-ref-id="3035-777">Wasteland</a>. The downloadable content was initially exclusive to the Xbox 360 and PC versions of the game, but was later released on the PlayStation 3.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System (V.A.T.S.)</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1326/780737-screenshot27.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-780737" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1326/780737-screenshot27.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-780737"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1326/780737-screenshot27.jpg"></a><figcaption>V.A.T.S. in action</figcaption></figure><p style="">In addition to the real-time first person action, Fallout 3 introduced a feature called <a href="/vault-tec-assisted-targeting-system/3015-1807/" data-ref-id="3015-1807">V.A.T.S</a>. (<b>V</b>ault-Tec <b>A</b>ssisted <b>T</b>argeting <b>S</b>ystem) which pauses the game and allows the character to queue attacks on specific enemy body parts while calculating the odds of each shot hitting the target. The percentage chance of a hit and the damage done by each queued attack depend on several factors including player level, distance from target, perks obtained and skills, and weapon used. Each shot queued in V.A.T.S. requires a certain number of action points (AP) depending on weapon power; expending slightly less than a quarter with a single shot with some pistols, while expending them all with weapons such as the Fat Man. After use, the AP must then regenerate in real-time. However, continued combat in real-time while they are regenerating will cause them to fill up slower. Players can also take Jet, a Chem that briefly increases the amount of AP available to their character.</p><h3>Health &amp; Item Degradation</h3><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6843/870170-deathclaw_model.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-870170" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="1.3875338753388" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:138.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6843/870170-deathclaw_model.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-870170"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6843/870170-deathclaw_model.jpg"></a><figcaption>Shoot their legs to slow them down</figcaption></figure><p style="">When taking damage, the player's general health or limb health may be affected. General health meaning, of course, the life bar that shrinks as they take damage. However, Fallout 3 also has a specific limb system in place that can affect several things. Each limb has its own health bar, and when a player takes damage to that limb, it may become crippled. A crippled limb will affect certain things depending on which limb it is. For example, if the player has a crippled leg, they will walk much slower. If one of their arms is crippled, their accuracy will suffer. If the head gets crippled, the perception (ability to see enemies on the compass/radar) will decrease. The crippled system means that shooting for the head in V.A.T.S. may not always be the best idea. An example of this would be for <a href="/deathclaw/3015-1650/" data-ref-id="3015-1650">Deathclaws</a>. Deathclaws are extremely fast and strong opponents, so shooting and crippling their legs will prevent them from getting close. <a href="/stimpak/3055-1133/" data-ref-id="3055-1133">Stimpaks</a> can be applied to individual limbs (rather than used to heal general health) to fix them.</p><p style="">Radiation is also common in Fallout 3. Food and untreated water will give the player small amounts of radiation when they are consumed. There are also areas throughout the game that may be contaminated, such as nasty radiation pools, that will affect the player. The effects of radiation exposure are cumulative, and after being exposed beyond certain thresholds of tolerance, the player will get different levels of radiation sickness. The sicknesses will affect the players stats, or can kill the player if it's untreated and builds to extreme levels, although certain perks mitigate the penalties or even provide benefits through mutation such as repairing broken limbs when suffering from advanced radiation poisoning. Radiation levels can be reduced or brought back to zero by using certain medicines or getting treated by a doctor or home medical station.</p><p style="">Another very important aspect of the game is item degradation. Equipped armor and weapons will become damaged over time. The condition is represented by a bar. As an item becomes more and more damaged, it becomes less effective. Weapons lose damage and jam, and armor loses damage resistance. Items can be repaired by using parts of another item that is the same (for example, an assault rifle can be repaired by using parts of another assault rifle) or by paying certain people to do it. The repair skill dictates how much the player can repair their equipment (up to a certain percentage of full condition).</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/88339/1419592-psycho_f2.png" data-ref-id="1300-1419592" data-size="small" style="width: 115px" data-ratio="0.78260869565217" data-width="115" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:78.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/88339/1419592-psycho_f2.png" data-ref-id="1300-1419592"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/88339/1419592-psycho_f2.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/88339/1419592-psycho_f2.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Just like real life, take it easy with the Chems</figcaption></figure><p style="">Throughout their travels, players will encounter Chems (also known as drugs in the real world) that can be used to affect their performance. There are several different kinds, and if used too much, the player may become addicted. This leads to negative withdrawal symptoms if they don't take some of the drugs they are addicted to at regular intervals. The player can also become addicted to alcohol, and addictions can be cured by a doctor.</p><h3>Interaction</h3><p style="">Fallout 3 features an extensive dialogue system in which players can interact with almost every <a href="/non-player-character/3015-967/" data-ref-id="3015-967">NPC</a> in the game. Players are presented with multiple lines of speech to choose from, and the person they are talking to will react accordingly to the one they choose. Most dialogue options will have a "good" line and a "bad" line. Through interactions, players can pick up quests and gain information. They also have the potential to talk themselves out of certain situations. Occasionally, players are presented with a Speech challenge, represented by a dialog option marked "Speech" with a percentage next to it. The percentage represents the player's chance of success, based on their current Speech level. If they succeed, the player can often gain information about whatever they are talking about. If they fail, they will get nothing from it. Passing a Speech challenge also awards the player with <a href="/experience-points/3015-39/" data-ref-id="3015-39">experience points</a>.</p><h3>Lockpicking and Hacking</h3><p style="">Lockpicking and hacking are two ways of accessing areas, containers, information, or functions that would otherwise be inaccessible. Each is associated with a skill (Lockpicking and Science), dictating whether the player can attempt each of the 5 difficulty levels of locks and terminals (Very Easy, Easy, Average, Hard, and Very Hard). The player can also attempt to force the lock.</p><p style="">The player can try to pick locks on many objects throughout the Wasteland, including doors, ammunition boxes, and safes. Having at least one <a href="/bobby-pin/3055-1744/" data-ref-id="3055-1744">bobby pin</a> is required to pick a lock.</p><h4>Lockpicking Minigame</h4><p style="">The game will pause and an image of the lock will appear along with a bobby pin and a screwdriver. Using the left stick, the player can move the bobby pin around the keyhole. With the right stick, the player applies torque to the bobby pin to try and open it. If in the right spot, the lock will completely turn. If in the wrong spot, the lock will stop and the controller will vibrate. If one continues moving the bobby pin down in the same direction and the lock stops sooner, one is going the wrong way.</p><p style="">Hacking is less frequent than lockpicking and is a bit more difficult. Computers that must be hacked can contain backstory or important quest-related info, or allow environment-related functions like unlocking doors or deactivating <a href="/turret/3055-43/" data-ref-id="3055-43">turrets</a>.</p><h4>Hacking Minigame</h4><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14220/621291-vlcsnap_4617300.png" data-ref-id="1300-621291" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14220/621291-vlcsnap_4617300.png" data-ref-id="1300-621291"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14220/621291-vlcsnap_4617300.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14220/621291-vlcsnap_4617300.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hacking a terminal</figcaption></figure><p style="">When the player chooses an incorrect password, they'll see a fraction on the screen like 2/9 correct. This does not just mean that two of the letters are correct; rather, two of the letters are in the correct position. For example, suppose that the real password is FALLOUT. The player chooses ROLLOUT, and is 5/7 correct, because LLOUT is in the same position in both words. Conversely, if EFFECTS was chosen, it would be 0/7 correct, because while it shares letters with FALLOUT, none of the positions are the same. Some groups of characters are inside square brackets or parentheses. If the player clicks on these groups of characters, the terminal will either remove one incorrect password from the screen or it will replenish the amount of attempts. By doing this, the player can sometimes narrow down the amount of choices to just one word, allowing them to unlock the computer within a minute.</p><h3>Karma</h3><p style="">The <a href="/reputation/3015-2741/" data-ref-id="3015-2741">Karma</a> system implemented in Fallout 3 rates the player's actions throughout the game and portrays them as either a Good, Neutral, or Evil character depending on their choices. For instance, stealing, killing innocents and generally being horrible will earn bad Karma resulting in an Evil character.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1247102-1156109_800px_karmaf3_super.png" data-ref-id="1300-1247102" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.36" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:36.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1247102-1156109_800px_karmaf3_super.png" data-ref-id="1300-1247102"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3661/1247102-1156109_800px_karmaf3_super.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3661/1247102-1156109_800px_karmaf3_super.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Karma Levels range from Very Evil to Very Good</figcaption></figure><p style="">Whereas good deeds, such as helping hobos and treating people well will result in positive Karma and a Good character. A balance of these actions means the character will stay neutral. Many quests have different outcomes, and the player can usually choose which of these to pursue. The easiest way to do something often ends up with a lot of dead people and bad Karma, but the more skill based, reasonable or long winded methods usually have a reward of positive Karma. Being a Good character leads to helpful items and such from Neutral or Good NPCs, and vice versa for evil characters. The flip side to this is that evil or good characters will also run into heavily-armed hit groups with a contract for their head. Also, the karma status of the player can determine what kind of followers they can acquire. For example, Evil characters get <a href="/jericho/3005-8651/" data-ref-id="3005-8651">Jericho</a> and Clover, Good characters get <a href="/fawkes/3005-8633/" data-ref-id="3005-8633">Fawkes</a> and <a href="/star-paladin-cross/3005-9399/" data-ref-id="3005-9399">Star Paladin Cross</a>, and Neutral characters get <a href="/butch/3005-9245/" data-ref-id="3005-9245">Butch</a> and <a href="/sergeant-rl-3/3005-9384/" data-ref-id="3005-9384">Sergeant RL-3</a>. The player's Karma is points based and starts at zero. As the player performs Good and Evil actions they are evaluated and given the appropriate status:</p><h3>Actions that alter Karma</h3><ul><li>Killing an Evil character or creature: No gain or loss in Karma</li><li>Killing a very Evil character or creature: 100 Karma gain</li><li>Killing a good creature: -50 Karma</li><li>Killing a good person: -100 Karma</li><li>Stealing: -5/item</li><li>Good act during a quest: 50</li><li>Evil act during a quest: -50</li><li>Consuming a dead body: -1 (Perk needed)</li></ul><h3>Karma Classification</h3><p style="">Based on the number of points, the Karma system classifies the player as:</p><ul><li>Below -750 : Very Evil</li><li>-750 to -250: Evil</li><li>-250 to 250: Neutral</li><li>250 to 750: Good</li><li>Above 750: Very Good</li></ul><p style="">Furthermore, the Vault Dweller will be given a title based on their karma and current level, with Neutral, Evil and Good Karma titles unique for each level. There are 30 different Karma levels in Fallout 3.</p><h3>S.P.E.C.I.A.L.

It is a set of seven attributes that govern each of the game's skills, as well as certain character stats. They are first encountered during early childhood, when the player finds a picture book called "You're SPECIAL" and assigns points to the SPECIAL attributes. Each one starts at a level of 5, and at this moment the player is asked to split up a further 5 total points between the skills. There is little use in leveling one attribute up to 10, because then it cannot be improved later in the game. SPECIAL can't exceed 10 or drop lower than 1, so if they reach these caps even if an item is equipped or a chem or foodstuff consumed that could add a point to one of them, there will be no change.</p><p style="">SPECIAL stands for:</p><ul><li><b>Strength</b><br />Affects: Melee Weapons, Carry Weight, Melee damage bonus</li><li><b>Perception<br /></b>Affects: Explosives, Lock-pick, Energy Weapons, minimum distance for red compass markers</li><li><b>Endurance<br /></b>Affects: Hit Points, Poison Resistance, Radiation Resistance, Big Guns, Unarmed, oxygen counter when diving</li><li><b>Charisma<br /></b>Affects: NPC disposition towards player, Barter, Speech</li><li><b>Intelligence<br /></b>Affects: Number of new skill points per level, Medicine, Repair, Science</li><li><b>Agility<br /></b>Affects: Action Points available for V.A.T.S., Small Guns, Sneak</li><li><b>Luck<br /></b>Affects: All skills, Critical chance, Accuracy, random encounters</li></ul><h3>Skills</h3><p style="">Skills dictate the player character's effectiveness in specific elements of gameplay. They are affected by the player's SPECIAL stats, as well as certain equipment, perks, and temporary effects. The player is asked to "tag" three skills at the beginning of the game, which grants a bonus of fifteen points to each.</p><p style="">While Fallout 1 and 2 both had 18 skills in total, Fallout 3 reduces the number to 13, partly by merging similar skills - Doctor and First Aid are replaced by a general Medicine skill, for instance, and disarming traps is governed by Explosives or Repair, rather than a dedicated Traps skill. The Gambling and Outdoorsman skills are not carried forward in any form.</p><p style="">A Vault Boy bobblehead for each skill can be found hidden somewhere in the game world, adding 10 points to that skill when used.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Skill</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1618027-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-1618027" data-size="small" style="width: 150px" data-ratio="0.74666666666667" data-width="150" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:74.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1618027-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-1618027"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1618027-1.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1618027-1.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Barter</figcaption></figure></td><td>Affects prices when trading with merchants.</td></tr><tr><td><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1618028-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-1618028" data-size="small" style="width: 150px" data-ratio="0.74666666666667" data-width="150" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:74.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1618028-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-1618028"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1618028-1.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1618028-1.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Big Guns</figcaption></figure></td><td>Affects damage done with Big Guns (Fat Man, Flamer, Minigun, etc.)</td></tr><tr><td><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1618031-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-1618031" data-size="small" style="width: 150px" data-ratio="0.74666666666667" data-width="150" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:74.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1618031-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-1618031"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1618031-1.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1618031-1.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Energy Weapons</figcaption></figure></td><td>Affects damage done with Energy Weapons (Laser Pistol, Laser Rifle, Plasma Rifle, etc.)</td></tr><tr><td><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1618037-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-1618037" data-size="small" style="width: 150px" data-ratio="0.74666666666667" data-width="150" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:74.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1618037-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-1618037"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1618037-1.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1618037-1.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Explosives</figcaption></figure></td><td>Affects explosives damage (Frag grenades, plasma grenades, landmines, etc.) as well as the ability of handling explosive traps.</td></tr><tr><td><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1618036-_.png" data-ref-id="1300-1618036" data-size="small" style="width: 150px" data-ratio="0.74666666666667" data-width="150" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:74.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1618036-_.png" data-ref-id="1300-1618036"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1618036-_.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1618036-_.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Lockpick</figcaption></figure></td><td>Affects which level of locks can be picked (easy, average, hard).

The main character will begin by finding a standard array of basic weapons, like pistols, knives, and assault rifles. As the game progresses, however, players will find many unique weapons like the Alien Blaster, Lincoln's Repeater, and Mesmetron. These exotic weapons keep in tone with the 1950's sci-fi theme present in the Fallout universe.</p><h3>Random Encounters</h3><p style="">While exploring the Wasteland, the player may experience a random event/encounter.

Followed shortly after by the death of the character's mother, who dies in childbirth due to cardiac arrest, the story then jumps ahead to when the character begins walking. This is the first introduction to the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system, allowing for further character customization. Shortly after, the player enters their 10th birthday party, where they receive their Pip-Boy. Following a few altercations, the player reaches age 16 and takes the G.O.A.T. exam, determining their skills. Another advance occurs, and the player is awoken by Amata, who informs the character that their father, James, has left the vault without warning and under mysterious circumstances. This desertion attracts the ire of The Overseer, who attempts to apprehend the player character for questioning through his security force. The player fights their way to the father's lab, where they find the body of Jonas. In that lab, the player receives a message from their father, explaining that he had to leave and they should not follow. After persevering further through the vault, the player encounters Amata being questioned (or tortured) by her father. After securing her escape, the player learns of a secret exit through the Overseer's office, and fights their way to the exit. After leaving the vault, they venture out into an utterly destroyed Washington DC, though the wasteland is far from lifeless.</p><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17450/941318-400px_threedog.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-941318" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17450/941318-400px_threedog.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-941318"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/17450/941318-400px_threedog.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/17450/941318-400px_threedog.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Three Dog has info about James, but wants a favor in return </figcaption></figure><p style="">The first town the Lone Wanderer runs across is the town of Megaton, a gated community built in a crater around an unexploded atomic bomb. It is here that the player is given the choice to either disarm the undetonated bomb for their father's whereabouts from Lucas Simms, or pay off Colin Moriarty. Eventually, they learn that James ventured into the ruins of Washington DC, searching for a radio station, called Galaxy News Radio, located within. Following a perilous journey into the city, the player has their first encounter with a large contingent of the Brotherhood of Steel along with one of the leaders of the Brotherhood of Steel, Sarah Lyons. A large push occurs to reach the radio station, fighting through waves of Super Mutants, eventually resulting in an encounter with a Behemoth. Following their entry to the radio station, the player is introduced to the man that runs Galaxy News Radio, Three Dog. In return for information Three Dog has about James, the player must travel to the Museum of Technology within the DC ruins, in search of a new relay dish capable of broadcasting Galaxy News Radio across the Capital Wasteland. After mounting this new dish on the Washington Monument, the player returns to Three Dog, who recalls that James had come to ask about Rivet City, a settlement built in an old aircraft carrier. The Lone Wanderer sets off again, follows in James' footsteps.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="medium" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7395/2513396-2013-06-14_00007.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2513396" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7395/2513396-2013-06-14_00007.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2513396"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7395/2513396-2013-06-14_00007.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7395/2513396-2013-06-14_00007.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>One of the game's more surreal interludes</figcaption></figure><p style="">After a thorough security check to gain entry to Rivet City, the Wanderer is referred to an old acquaintance of James, one Dr. Li, who reveals exactly what their father's goals were. The player learns that their father left the Vault in order to complete a project from before the Lone Wanderer was born, a water purifier that would supply clean water for all living things, called Project Purity. She tells the Lone Wanderer of the former lab that housed Project Purity and that their father might have gone there. The Lone Wanderer visits the Jefferson Memorial and finds out through a series of audio notes that their father went to Vault 112 in search of a G.E.C.K., which was the last component needed to cause Project Purity to complete it's function. The Wanderer themselves then travels to Vault 112, where they are greeted by a Robobrain ushering them into a stasis chamber, only to discover that the residents, along with James, are all trapped within these chambers. All of the residents existed within a simulation, with Stanislaus Braun, disguised as a young girl, pulling the strings. The player is forced to either end the simulation, killing everyone inside, or comply with Braun's twisted desires and go on a murder spree. Following this, when the player is allowed to leave the simulation, they learn that James was trapped inside the simulation as well, disguised as a dog, watching all of the player's actions. Regardless of choice, the Wanderer and James escape Vault 112 and make their way back to Rivet City. James convinces Dr. Li to accompany the Wanderer and him, along with her team back to the Jefferson Memorial to restart Project Purity. Once inside, the entire team beings work to restore Project Purity to it's former glory, and the Wanderer and James enjoy their short reunion. Unfortunately, shortly after the team begins their repair, the Enclave comes to the Jefferson Memorial and tries to take over the project for their own purposes. During the confrontation, James and Colonel Autumn are locked inside the main chamber in a standoff for control. Eventually, James sacrifices himself and kills several Enclave soldiers (including, apparently, Col. Autumn) by flooding the testing chamber with lethal amounts of radiation.</p><figure data-align="left" data-size="medium" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3715/958675-fallout_3_broken_steel_pc_002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-958675" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3715/958675-fallout_3_broken_steel_pc_002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-958675"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3715/958675-fallout_3_broken_steel_pc_002.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3715/958675-fallout_3_broken_steel_pc_002.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Enclave troops are just bad news for everyone</figcaption></figure><p style="">After the sacrifice, the Lone Wanderer escapes the lab with Dr. Li and some of hear team through some underground tunnels and eventually ends up in the Citadel, the East Coast headquarters of the Brotherhood of Steel. After recovering and a short respite, Dr. Li pleads Elder Lyons to aid the Wanderer to finish Project Purity by finding a G.E.C.K. and take Project Purity back from the Enclave. Following a discussion with Scribe Rothchild, the player learns that they must travel through the Little Lamplight Caverns to reach Vault 87, which is believed to contain a G.E.C.K. The Lone Wanderer eventually reaches Little Lamplight, but is stopped by Mayor MacCready, who will only allow entry to the player, (barring excellent speech skill or the Child at Heart Perk) if they can rescue some children who were captured by slavers. Following the breakout from Paradise Falls, the Wanderer gains entry to Little Lamplight and eventually enters Vault 87. It is here that they learn that Vault 87 was used to create and test the F.E.V. (Forced Evolutionary Virus) and is the breeding source of the Super Mutants in Washington DC. Following the discovery and aid in extradition of Fawkes, the Lone Wanderer acquires the G.E.C.K. After parting ways with Fawkes while leaving the vault, the Lone Wanderer is ambushed by the Enclave, who knock him out and bring them to their headquarters in Raven Rock, commandeering the G.E.C.K. for themselves.</p><p style="">Awakening in their cell in Raven Rock, the Lone Wanderer is briefly interrogated by the revived Colonel Autumn, before being interrupted by President John Henry Eden, who allows the Lone Wanderer access to his control room. As the Lone Wanderer makes their way to the control room, Colonel Autumn goes against President Eden's orders and commands the Enclave soldiers to intercept the player. The Wanderer fights their way to the control room, and discovers that the President is actually a supercomputer who was given control of the United States. In the event of an end of the world scenario, President Eden was enacted to continue running the government sectors.The President and the Wanderer have a lengthy conversation, with Eden eventually imploring the player to feed a modified F.E.V. into Project Purity. This strain would kill anything with mutations that drinks from the purified water, allowing the Enclave to begin a new, mutation free society. Unfortunately, this would also kill most of the allies the Wanderer has encountered, weighing the decision heavily. If the Wanderer had the skill, (or the override code stolen from Col. Autumn) they can in fact destroy Raven Rock, crippling the Enclave forces immensely.</p><p style="">After the Lone Wanderer escapes Raven Rock, they are reunited with Fawkes, who aid in their return to the Citadel. The Brotherhood of Steel is preparing an all out assault on the Jefferson Memorial, planning to strike while the Enclave is off balance. Fortuitously, along to help the assault is Liberty Prime, who had regained function through the use of Dr. Li's research. Sarah Lyons invites the player to join Lyons' Pride, and the assault begins. With the aid of Liberty Prime in removing barriers, and the assault force of the Brotherhood, eventually the alliance is able to decimate the Enclave defenders which allows the Lone Wanderer to enter the control room. It is there the Wanderer and Lyons' Pride confront Colonel Autumn, who could be forced to stand down either through violence or persuasion. Following the confrontation, the player is then informed by Dr. Li through the intercom that Project Purity has been damaged in the attack will overload if someone doesn't activate it. Unfortunately, the chamber must be sealed with the start-up sequence begins, and the one who activates it will be bathed in lethal doses of radiation. Before entering the chamber, the player is faced with the choice of injecting the modified F.E.V. into Project Purity effectively killing everyone, or allowing mutants and wastelanders to continue to exist. The Lone Wanderer will then have the choice to activate Project Purity, tell Sarah Lyons she must activate it, or do nothing and allow it to be destroyed.

The new weapons and armor include top-secret technology used by both sides during the war, some of which the player can then use throughout the main game.

However, Black Isle Studios was suddenly closed down when their owner, Interplay Entertainment, went bankrupt. Bethesda first announced it had acquired the rights to the Fallout series from Interplay in 2004, although no information about Fallout 3 was released until 2007, when a teaser video and concept art were released. Bethesda purchased the license from struggling Interplay for just over $1 million and considered an upfront payment on future royalties. Bethesda only got the rights to make single-player Fallout games, while Interplay retained the rights to develop a Fallout MMO. Reactions to the acquisition in the gaming community were generally positive. Bethesda, having achieved critical and financial success with Morrowind, and nearing the final stretch of development for the much hyped Oblivion, had become a well-respected developer in the RPG genre, establishing a considerable pedigree. Controversy among Fallout fans abounded, however, when it became apparent that Fallout 3 was going to move away from its traditional top-down, isometric view from the original games.</p><h3>Van Buren</h3><p style="">Van Buren was the codename for <a href="/black-isle-studios/3010-99/" data-ref-id="3010-99">Black Isle</a>’s version of Fallout 3. It was canceled in 2003 when <a href="/black-isle-studios/3010-99/" data-ref-id="3010-99">Black Isle</a> went out of business, although the game itself was nearing completion. It would have had a multiplayer mode and a combat system where the player could wield two weapons. A tech demo was created, but Bethesda will not be releasing it to the general public.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14220/361452-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-361452" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.8" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14220/361452-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-361452"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14220/361452-1.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14220/361452-1.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Inventory in the Van Buren Tech Demo</figcaption></figure><p style="">The story took place around the year 2250 and unfolded across Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and Nevada. The player was going to find him or herself in prison for crimes that they were either innocent or guilty of. One day they’d wake up in a different cell than they had gone to sleep in. Then an attack on the prison would rupture the walls and give the player (and many others) a chance to escape into the Wasteland. Once free, the player would be besieged by robots and questions.</p><p style="">The villain was a man called Presper. He was a mad scientist who planned on using remaining nuclear weapons to totally obliterate all the life on the planet, as he deemed it unworthy. The attack on the prison was one step in that plan. The prisoners were all marked as contaminated with a virus similar to FEV called Limit 115. When a large majority of prisoners were returned to the Quarantine Zone (otherwise known as the prison) a Super AI called Ulysses that controlled it would scan and purge the world's contaminated zones to prevent further contagion. The problem was that so much of the world was tainted it would result in a new and more devastating nuclear strike than what had come before. Presper was counting on this and those he deemed Pure would survive on in his Boulder Dome until a time he decided the Earth was safe for resettlement. At that point they’d ascend to the surface and start again. The player's mission was to uncover his plot and stop it. Ultimately, though, the player would at least partially fail. In the critical moments some nukes would launch and it was up to the player to decide exactly what got hit and what didn't.</p><p style="">In the Fallout continuity, all the events of Van Buren are considered non-canon.</p><h2>Rating Controversy</h2><p style="">On July 4, 2008, Fallout 3 was refused classification by the OFLC in Australia, thus making the game illegal for sale in the country. In order for the game to be reclassified, the offending content in the Australian version of the game would have to be removed by Bethesda Softworks and the game resubmitted to the OFLC. According the OFLC board report, the game was refused classification due to the "realistic visual representations of drugs and their delivery method (bringing) the 'science-fiction' drugs in line with 'real-world' drugs. However, just a month later, Australian retailer Gamechip started taking pre-orders for a drug-free version of the game. It now looks like the</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4057/190914-fallout_3_4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-190914" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.56333333333333" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4057/190914-fallout_3_4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-190914"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4057/190914-fallout_3_4.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4057/190914-fallout_3_4.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>And with all the heads exploding, you can see why.</figcaption></figure><p style="">game has been modified for release instead of outright banned though nothing is official. Australia is no stranger to banning games, in 2008 <a href="/dark-sector/3030-20497/" data-ref-id="3030-20497">Dark Sector</a>, <a href="/shellshock-2-blood-trails/3030-23254/" data-ref-id="3030-23254">Shellshock 2: Blood Trials</a> and Fallout 3 were banned. In August of 2008, however, the Australian Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC) granted a rating of MA15 after changes were made to in-game drug references, particularly the renaming of morphine to " <a href="/med-x/3055-1942/" data-ref-id="3055-1942">Med-X</a>." In their report on the revised edition of the game, the OFLC found that "The drug references within this revised version are justified by context and lend a strong playing impact to the game." The report also notes that drugs in the game are now "depicted as stylized icons on a menu with the drug use itself not depicted."</p><h3>Original ruling</h3><p style="">The original ruling by the OFLC's stated that "the game contains the option to take a variety of drugs known as "chems" using a device which is connected to the character's arm. These "chems" have positive and some negative effects (lowering of intelligence, or the character may become addicted to the chem). The positive effects include increase in strength, stamina, resistance to damage, agility, and hit points. Corresponding with the list of various "chems" are small visual representations of the drugs; these include syringes, tablets, pill bottles, a crack-type pipe, and blister packs. In the Board's view, these realistic visual representation of drugs and their delivery method bring the 'science-fiction' drugs in line with 'real-world' drugs. The player can also select and use Morphine (a prescribed drug) which has the positive effect of enabling the character to ignore limb pain when the character's extremities are targeted by the enemy."</p><h2>Further Controversy</h2><h3>Japan</h3><p style="">Some changes to the Japanese version of Fallout 3. The biggest change involves the elimination of the "Power of the Atom" side-quest, about a nuclear bomb in the middle of a town, with players having the option to detonate the device or not. Also removed is Mr. Burke, an NPC who invites the player to detonate the town. Another change relates to the name of a weapon. Although not mentioned in the announcement, it refers to the "Fat Man" mini-nuke launcher. Lesser changes involve the renaming of creatures, as well as a reduction in the amount of blood and corpses found in the game.</p><p style="">Another mini-controversy caused by the game appeared at Game Developers Conference in <a href="/san-francisco/3035-191/" data-ref-id="3035-191">San Francisco</a>, where the game's developer <a href="/emil-pagliarulo/3040-74863/" data-ref-id="3040-74863">Emil Pagliarulo</a> asked the audience what landmarks in Japan could be destroyed for the game.</p><h3>India</h3><p style="">Microsoft India canceled its plans to release Fallout 3 for the Xbox 360 in India, which was earlier set to release in the country on October 28 2008. A press statement issued by Microsoft states that the game included certain content that could potentially hurt Indian sensibilities. Due to distribution issues in the region, Microsoft had taken up the role of distributor for Fallout 3 in India, while the PlayStation 3 and PC versions of the game were never scheduled for release in the country.</p><h2>Pop Culture References</h2><ul><li>The quest titled "THOSE!" is reference to the 1950's Sci-Fi film THEM! about giant ants.</li><li>The quest "Replicated Man" is very similar to film Blade Runner in which Harrison Ford's character may or may not be Android hunting down other Androids.</li><li>The character <a href="/bryan-wilks/3005-8556/" data-ref-id="3005-8556">Bryan Wilks</a> during the quest "Those" utters the line "Now I know what a TV dinner feels like".

Fracture tells the story of Jet Brody, a soldier for the Atlantic Alliance (the former East Coast), as he fights the Republic of Pacifica (the former West Coast) led by former Alliance General Sheridan. ]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<p style="">The year is 2161 and the United States has become divided between two ideologies. In the eastern U.S. is the Atlantic Alliance, a group that believes the cure to global warming is cybernetic engineering. In the west, the Republic of Pacifica has turned to human genetic engineering to curb the bodily effects of global warming. You play as Jet Brody, formerly Mason Briggs, a foot soldier and demolitions expert for the Atlantic Alliance. Throughout the game, you'll progress from San Francisco down along the coast of California, witnessing along the way the harsh ramifications of unchecked global warming. From there, you will proceed to the Southwest and witness the full-brunt of genetic engineering. Finally, you will head to Washington DC to finish the fight. Throughout the game, you will be chasing the Pacificans' secret weapon. </p> <p style="">The most innovative aspect of Fracture is Jet's ability, through various weapons, to deform the environment. With these weapons Jet can raise and lower the ground (to provide cover from enemy fire or reach higher places, for instance). A Spike Grenade will cause a magma spike-tower to rise from the ground. A vortex grenade uses the Earth's gravitational pull to suck surrounding objects into a whirlwind using a vortex grenade. Jet also has conventional weapons, including the Bulldog Assault Rifle, a shotgun, and a sniper-rifle. Terrain-specific weapons include the Black-Widow, the Bangalore, and more.</p> <p style="">The enemies will be mostly Pacificans. Pacifican enemies will be genetically-enhanced, yet can deform terrain to a certain extent. A mini-boss shown in many demos is a Pacifican enemy that has a giant, green head. Only a headshot will kill it. Enemy AI has been a focus of Day 1 Studios.  Since the terrain is dynamic, it has served as a problem that the developers were eager to conquer. </p> <p style="">Award-winning composer Michael Giacchino along with Chad Seiter and Chris Tilton have composed the music for Fracture.</p> <p style="">Fracture was developed at Day One Studios, makers of MechAssault, and is published by Lucasarts.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>20516</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/1/14036/824171-fracture_cover.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14036/824171-fracture_cover.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/1/14036/824171-fracture_cover.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14036/824171-fracture_cover.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/14036/824171-fracture_cover.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/14036/824171-fracture_cover.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/1/14036/824171-fracture_cover.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Fracture]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>6</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-1/]]></api_detail_url><id>1</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB:

Like most other games, the handheld and console versions of the game are significantly different, whereas one is an open-world action game and the other is a top-down perspective shooter. The game loosely follows the plot of the film (introducing new characters from the comics not found in the film), and features the voices of <a data-ref-id="3040-97850" href="/robert-downey-jr/3040-97850/" slug="robert-downey-jr">Robert Downey Jr.</a> and <a data-ref-id="3040-98017" href="/terrence-howard/3040-98017/" slug="terrence-howard">Terrence Howard</a>.</p><p style="">The game was universally panned by critics. Receiving scores ranging from 15% to 60% (depending on the version), the game was criticized for poor controls, graphical quality, and tedious gameplay. Generally, the Nintendo DS version was more well-received than the console based versions, although it was still criticized for repetitiveness and unnecessary difficulty. In addition, the game was "honored" by being awarded the Worst Game Everyone Played in GameSpot's 2008 awards.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2287/573816-irmap3082.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-573816" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2287/573816-irmap3082.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-573816"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2287/573816-irmap3082.jpg"></a><figcaption>The flight sequences of the game were well-received</figcaption></figure><p style="">Spanning over 13 missions, Iron Man stars <a data-ref-id="3005-1370" href="/iron-man/3005-1370/" slug="iron-man">Tony Stark</a> fighting a variety of enemies and supervillains who are in possession of Stark weapons. An open-world game, the only levels that are linear are the first few tutorial missions. While the game only loosely follows the plot of the film, each mission is still introduced and finished with a cutscene. While the game was praised for the detailed open-world environments, the combat was not as well-received.</p><p style="">Consisting primarily of aerial combat, Iron Man has a variety of weapons and abilities at his disposal. His primary modes of attack are missiles and repulsor beams, which consistently recharge, as well as a powerful unibeam attack. As combat progresses, the player is tasked with dodging incoming missiles, enemy fire, and other aerial enemies (particularly helicopters). To deal with larger enemies such as helicopters and tanks, Iron Man can grapple himself towards an enemy, quickly disposing of the target (e.g. breaking a helicopter in half, ripping the lid off of a tank).</p><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2287/573813-irmap3081.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-573813" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2287/573813-irmap3081.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-573813"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2287/573813-irmap3081.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2287/573813-irmap3081.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The combat was criticized for being too repetitive.</figcaption></figure><p style="">As the player completes missions, credits are earned that can be used to continuously upgrade Iron Man's abilities. Not only is the recharge time upgradeable, but the player can also customize Iron Man's default Mark III armor. Additionally, the player can upgrade health, speed, and attack power (which can also be upgraded by rerouting auxiliary power, although this quickly detracts from Iron Man's health).</p><p style="">After the completion of certain levels, a new mode is unlocked known as One Man Army. In this mode, the player can go into certain timed levels in which the sole goal is to kill as many enemies as possible. Completing these levels unlocks new suits for the player, such as Hulkbuster and Extremis armor.

The only story sequence involved is the first portion of the film, in which Tony Stark is kidnapped by terrorists. Controlled by the D-pad and touch screen in conjunction (whereas the D-pad controls movement and the touch screen controls weapon fire), the game pits Iron Man against a variety of enemies.</p><p style="">Differing from the console versions in many aspects, Iron Man also features ground missions as well as aerial missions. While both are controlled in the same way, ground combat progresses at a slower rate than the aerial missions. Each mission gives players specific tasks to complete, but players are still rewarded for destroying other structures and enemies (these points can be used to purchase upgrades to Iron Man's suit).</p><p style="">The largest criticism for the game was its field of view, as players are only able to see enemies on the top screen (as well as the lack of a radar). This causes a variety of problems, including the fact that enemies can attack from off-screen. Other criticisms include the lack of a map, the occasionally awkward control scheme, lack of multiplayer, and general length of the game.

and subways as you fend off destructive mythical creatures.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2>Legendary was a game developed by <a data-ref-id="3010-2364" href="/spark-unlimited/3010-2364/" slug="spark-unlimited">        Spark Unlimited</a> and published by Gamecock Media Group.  Legendary was  released on November 4th, 2008 (on PS3 and Xbox 360) and November 18th, 2008 (PC).  The game includes a single player campaign and multiplayer.<br/><br/><h2>Story</h2>Legendary follows the story of an art thief named <a data-ref-id="3005-10025" href="/charles-deckard/3005-10025/" slug="charles-deckard">    Charles Deckard</a>.  The game begins in <a data-ref-id="3035-109" href="/new-york/3035-109/" slug="new-york">        New York's</a> Museum of Modern Art, where Deckard is tricked into opening <a data-ref-id="3055-2091" href="/pandoras-box/3055-2091/" slug="pandoras-box">   Pandora's Box</a> during a routine art heist.  Once Deckard opens the box, his left hand is burned with a Signet, an insignia of Pandora.  In addition to gaining the insignia of Pandora, Deckard also releases mythical creatures upon the earth.  Such creatures include: griffons,  golems, <a data-ref-id="3015-543" href="/werewolves/3015-543/" slug="werewolves">        werewolves</a>, fire drakes, and minotaurs.  Along the way, Deckard discovers the Black Order, a group sent to destroy Deckard and contain the monsters released from Pandora's box.  Eventually, the player discovers that the Black Order isn't actually trying to contain the mythical monsters, rather, they plan to capture the monsters so they can be used as super soldiers for its developing army.<br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2> <figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image"

in standard FPS games, Legendary gives the player the ability to siphon Animus Energy through the Pandora Signet when an enemy is killed.  Once siphoned, the souls become energy that can be used to replenish health or to perform a force-push that can knock down impending barricades or stun enemies.  Enemies include many different mythical creatures, including: "normal" and "alpha" werewolves, minotaurs, griffons, golems, a kraken, fire drakes, echidnas, Nari (or Narfi), the God of Chaos Loki, bloodticks, and dragons.<br/><br/> <br/><br/><h2>Enemy Types</h2> <u> <b><i>Firedrakes:</i></b></u>   <br/> These fire-breathing, heavily armored lizards can usually be found underground, although some do venture out into the sunlight in search of fresh meat. They can spit large fireballs at foes, so even if you are a good distance away, they can still get you. If  you get too near, the drake will send out a fire pulse from its body, pushing you back. Their armor can stand up to large barrages of bullets, so your best bet would probably be either the shotgun or, of all things, the fire axe. Like mythological salamanders, firedrakes spawn in fire pits, so you will want to use water to take those out. On contact with water, even the hardiest firedrake will harden and die.<br/><br/><h3><i>Limos Werewolves:</i></h3>Despite the myths, werewolves are not transformed humans, but a killer canine-ape hybrid. They can't turn you into one of them, so they'll just settle for ripping your head off. Cursed by Limos, the Greek god of hunger, the lesser Limos werewolves have to eat constantly, or risk eating themselves from the inside out. They are extremely agile, so rapid-fire guns are your best bet. Werewolves can regenerate from most damage, meaning you have to decapitate them to prevent them from coming back. If one falls with its head still intact, rush in with the fire axe to stop it from getting back up.<br/><br/><h3><i>Alpha Werewolves:</i></h3>Recognized by their thick coat of fur, Alpha werewolves are much more hardy  than their lesser cousins. The same rules apply, but Alphas can take a lot more damage. Occasionally, Alpha werewolves will jump on you and attempt to maul you. Follow the on-screen prompts to save your life and turn the tables, resulting in a one-hit K.O.! Oh, one more thing: Alphas most often attack in packs with their weaker cousins, so stay on your toes.<br/><br/><h3><i>Nari<u> </u></i><i><b> :</b></i></h3>  These flying imps resemble pixies, but are equipped with razor-sharp teeth and talons. Keep on the alert for their trademark laughter, sounding like hundreds of little girls. Nari mainly flitter around in flocks, becoming intangible and invulnerable. When they want to attack you, they turn solid and float in to claw at your face. In those few seconds, use a rapid-fire weapon to shoot them out of the air. Nari are very cunning and very, very dangerous. They can possess inanimate objects and turn them against you, leading to all kinds of mischief and slaughter.<br/><br/><h3><i>Minotaurs:</i></h3>These towering bull-men are not to be taken lightly. They are immensely  strong, fast, and carry huge clubs. They are nearly bullet-proof from the front, so your only chance is to evade them and blast away at their back with heavy-duty weapons like the shotgun. Even then, it still takes a lot to bring them down. Good luck fighting more than one at the same time...<br/><br/><h3><i>Griffons:</i><u> <b> </b></u></h3>  You will want to avoid these as much as possible. These flying predators are as large as buses and more powerful than minotaurs. Fortunately, griffons tend to keep away from you, flying around in the sky (and taking down your air support). However, on occasion, one will swoop in close enough to decide that you look tasty, at which point you have no choice but to do battle. Keep as far away from the slashing beak as possible, and proceed to fill it with as many kinds of lead as you can find. It's an entire different story when you have the rocket launcher, however. One well placed rocket should ensure that the bird never flies again.<br/><br/><h3><i>Echidnas:</i></h3>No, these are not the spiky monotremes from Australia. They're not the lost members of Knuckle's race either. These tentacled monsters are based off of the deadly serpent-woman from Greek mythology, and are every bit as slimy and bloodthirsty as their mother. You never get to see the full monster, but the tentacles will eagerly snatch passerby and pull them to a grisly death. If you should find yourself in an echidna's grasp, quickly blast it with your gun to make it release you. Since these creatures actually grab you, you will want to avoid using fire to attack them. Although echidnas never venture out of water, staying dry doesn't always mean you are safe...<br/><br/><h3><i>Tsuchigumo's Children:</i></h3>In Japanese mythology, the ancient spider-demon Tsuchigumo was killed by the hero Raiko. From the demon's corpse, however, thousands of red spiders poured out into the world. Nicknamed "Blood Spiders", these little devils come in colonies produced by a vile-looking queen. The queen will constantly pump out spiders, which will make a beeline (spiderline?) straight for you, exploding when they reach you. The only way to stop the swarm is to take out the queen. Even then, the queen will release the rest of her offspring upon her death, so don't let up until there's not an insect in sight.<br/><br/><h3><i>Golem:</i></h3> In Jewish folklore, golems are hulking brutes made from clay, used as household servants. <em><strong>This </strong></em>golem, on the other hand, is made from building rubble and smashed cars, and is getting his "Godzilla" on in Times Square. Bullets and even missiles are a joke against this fella, since he <em>is </em>made out of <strong>BUILDINGS</strong>. However, the only thing keeping the colossus together is a magnetic field sucking in debris. Your one chance on stopping this guy is to use E.M.P. devices to knock out the field, and even that is FAR from easy.<br/><br/><h3><i>Kraken:</i></h3> While the situation on land is bad, it's even worse in the oceans. Pandora's Box has awoken nameless leviathans from their ancient slumber. One of the worst is the Scandinavian sea monster, the Kraken. Big Boy here decides to get in on the action too, heading to London. Soon enough, the Kraken hauls itself out of the Thames and rips down Big Ben! Like the golem, the kraken requires heavy-duty weapons to take down, the difference being that the kraken is still flesh and blood. Use the rocket launcher to shoot its tentacles. When the kraken roars in pain, shoot another rocket  down the sea monster's throat. Easy? You wish. <br/> <br/><br/> <h2>Multiplayer</h2> Legendary has an online multiplayer component.  <br/><br/><u> <b><br/></b></u><h2>Critical Reception</h2>Legendary received mostly negative reviews, including a 2.5 (Xbox version) and a 2.3 (PS3) from IGN, although OXM and Gameplanet each gave it a 7.5.]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>20532</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/1817650-box_legend.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/1817650-box_legend.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/1817650-box_legend.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/1817650-box_legend.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/1817650-box_legend.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1817650-box_legend.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/1817650-box_legend.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Legendary]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>8</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-16/]]></api_detail_url><id>16</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: M]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-31/]]></api_detail_url><id>31</id><name><![CDATA[OFLC: M]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2008-10-21 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/legendary/3030-20532/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20534/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-05-16 11:45:50</date_added><date_last_updated>2014-04-28 13:36:56</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[Take control of Indiana Jones and play through the first three original films, Lego style!]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Released on June 3, 2008 for <a data-ref-id="3045-94" href="/pc/3045-94/">  PC</a>, <a data-ref-id="3045-19" href="/playstation-2/3045-19/">  PS2</a>, <a data-ref-id="3045-35" href="/playstation-3/3045-35/">  PS3</a>, <a data-ref-id="3045-18" href="/psp/3045-18/">  PSP</a>, <a data-ref-id="3045-20" href="/xbox-360/3045-20/">  Xbox 360</a>, <a data-ref-id="3045-52" href="/nintendo-ds/3045-52/">  DS</a>, and <a data-ref-id="3045-36" href="/wii/3045-36/">  Wii</a>, Lego Indiana Jones lets players get into <a data-ref-id="3005-1424" href="/indiana-jones/3005-1424/">  Indy</a>'s Lego shoes and experience breathtaking events from the films Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4938/741381-indy.png" data-ref-id="1300-741381" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4938/741381-indy.png" data-ref-id="1300-741381"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4938/741381-indy.png"></a><figcaption>Artifacts from each level come together</figcaption></figure><p style="">Much like in the previous <a data-ref-id="3025-449" href="/lego-star-wars/3025-449/">  Lego Star Wars</a> games, Lego Indy offers a number of levels based on each of the three films, and you're free to play through each movie's storyline in any order you want.

hit.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style=""><i>Mafia II</i> is a <a href="/sandbox/3015-453/" data-ref-id="3015-453"> sandbox</a>-style <a href="/third-person-perspective/3015-464/" data-ref-id="3015-464"> third-person</a> action/driving game developed by <a href="../../2k-czech/65-6511/" rel="nofollow"> 2K Czech</a> for the <a href="/xbox-360/3045-20/" data-ref-id="3045-20"> Xbox 360</a>, <a href="/playstation-3/3045-35/" data-ref-id="3045-35"> Playstation 3</a>, and <a href="/games-for-windows-live/3015-2452/" data-ref-id="3015-2452"> Games for Windows</a>. The game was announced at the 2007 Leipzig Games Convention, where five screenshots along with a brief trailer were revealed. After two delays, <i>Mafia II</i> was released in North America on August 24, 2010 and internationally on August 27, 2010.</p><p style="">Set in the post-WW2 era, the player assumes the role of <a href="../../vito-scaletta/94-8707/" rel="nofollow"> Vito Scaletta</a>, a young soldier returning from <a href="../../world-war-ii/92-471/" rel="nofollow"> World War 2</a> to <a href="../../empire-bay/95-1769/" rel="nofollow"> Empire Bay</a> after a tour of duty overseas. Vito and his friend, <a href="../../joe-barbaro/94-8975/" rel="nofollow"> Joe Barbaro</a>, begin working in the criminal underworld of Empire Bay upon Vito's return. The story focuses on Vito and Joe’s friendship and life as part of the mafia. <i>Mafia II</i> plans to be much darker and less romantic than <a href="/mafia/3030-15879/" data-ref-id="3030-15879"> the first game</a> showing the story of a made man. The game will be set in the 1940s and 1950s in Empire Bay, a city inspired by <a href="../../new-york/95-109/" rel="nofollow"> New York</a> and <a href="../../san-francisco/95-191/" rel="nofollow"> San Francisco</a>.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style=""><i>Mafia II</i>'s story follows the long and dark journey of Vito Scalleta, as he progresses through his life of becoming a made man in the <a href="../../the-mafia/92-1294/" rel="nofollow"> mafia</a>. The game's setting will feature staples of the post-World War II period through the course of the story. In the game, you start poor but with the help of your friend Joe, you'll start doing a lot of criminal stuff to get money, <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/alcoholic-beverages/3055-698/" data-ref-id="3055-698">booze</a>, and chicks. First, you fight in <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/world-war-ii/3015-471/" data-ref-id="3015-471">WW2</a> for short time. Then, you come back and live in your mother's apartment for a day. You have a sister named <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/francesca/3005-19940/" data-ref-id="3005-19940">Francesca Scaletta</a>. You meet many people on your journey and make many bad decisions that you and Joe must fix.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style=""><i>Mafia II</i> takes place in 10 square miles of open-ended environments, and the player is able to explore the entire scenario without any restrictions from the start of the game. There are <i>no</i> loading screens, city will load continuously during play.</p><p style="">The Law in Empire Bay must be obeyed. When these laws are broken in view of the police, they will respond. However, the police interaction will be toned down compared to its predecessor.</p><h3>New Features</h3><figure data-ref-id="1300-1120157" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14036/1120157-snap10.jpg" data-size="small" data-align="right" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.56213017751479" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14036/1120157-snap10.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1120157"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14036/1120157-snap10.jpg"></a><figcaption>Vehicles can be customized, tuned, and repaired.</figcaption></figure><ul><li>There are over 120 licensed songs split between both eras and over 3 hours of original composed music.</li><li>There are about 50 different vehicles between both eras and can get dirty, suffer damage and run out of gas.</li><li>The <a href="/"> AI</a> has been improved, so the pedestrians will smoke, read newspapers, buy clothes, and wait for buses, while homeless people will search through garbage bins.</li><li>The player can own their own customizable cars that can even be customized with a personal license plate. Up to ten vehicles can be stored in Vito's garage.</li><li>Since such heavy emphasis has been placed on your own personal ride, the ability to utilize public transportation has been taken out. Vito may still ride in a cab for mission or two though.</li><li>Vito can buy various foods and drinks in restaurants scattered about the city.</li><li>Vito can also vandalize those restaurants and any other stores and the cops will be called. If you return to the scene of the crime you'll see police tape and the clerk or witnesses telling the officer your description based on what clothes you were wearing.</li><li>Cops only radio for reinforcements if you committed a large enough crime. New and multiple strategies to deceive them.</li><li>The police can chase other criminals instead of just you, and therefore it will contribute to their new, greater leniency.</li><li>There are 15 main chapters and some interwoven, voluntary sub-missions.</li><li>New and improved checkpoints.</li><li>The story may vary depending on how the player chooses to progress throughout the game.</li><li>In missions with a car, Joe often rides with you. Player controlled drive-by shooting has been completely taken out, though Joe may shoot out of the window when you're driving.</li><li>There are multiple gangs who have their territories in the different districts of Empire Bay.</li><li>There are two types of context-sensitive environment interactions: A "standard" action and a "violent" action.</li><li>Vito can steal a car by smashing the window, <a href="/"> lockpicking</a>, or <a href="/jacking/3015-1025/" data-ref-id="3015-1025"> carjacking</a>.</li><li>Objects in the environment e.g. bottles, chairs, etc. will be interactive, in both standard and violent contexts.</li><li>The game features over 200 <a href="/"> hand-to-hand</a> animations, as well as using the environment as an integral part of that combat.</li><li><a

violence will take a less 'gory', more realistic approach (i.e. bullet wounds, blood stains/ splatters.)</li><li>Many guns from the first game are back (i.e. <a href="/tommy-gun/3055-261/" data-ref-id="3055-261"> Thompson M1928</a>, <a href="/m1911/3055-61/" data-ref-id="3055-61"> Colt 1911</a>, pump-shotgun) but the 50's will bring about more modern firearms.</li></ul><figure

The game was developed by <a href="/clover-studio/3010-3345/" data-ref-id="3010-3345">Clover Studio</a>, and the port for the <a href="/wii/3045-36/" data-ref-id="3045-36">Wii</a> was developed by <a href="/ready-at-dawn-studios-llc/3010-5291/" data-ref-id="3010-5291">Ready at Dawn Studios</a> which was released in North America on April 15, 2008, and released in Europe on June 13, 2008, respectively. A high definition remaster, developed by <a href="/hexa-drive/3010-6576/" data-ref-id="3010-6576">Hexa Drive</a>, was released through the <a href="/playstation-network-ps3/3045-88/" data-ref-id="3045-88">PlayStation Network</a> on <a href="/playstation-3/3045-35/" data-ref-id="3045-35">PlayStation 3</a> on October 30, 2012, and features <a href="/playstation-move-support/3015-4669/" data-ref-id="3015-4669">PlayStation Move support</a>.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">In Ōkami, the player controls the sun goddess Amaterasu, who takes the form of a wolf. Ōkami is somewhat reminiscent of <a href="/the-legend-of-zelda/3025-9/" data-ref-id="3025-9">The</a> <a href="/the-legend-of-zelda/3025-9/" data-ref-id="3025-9">Legend of Zelda</a> games; Ōkami director <a href="/hideki-kamiya/3040-60123/" data-ref-id="3040-60123">Hideki Kamiya</a> has stated that <a href="/the-legend-of-zelda/3025-9/" data-ref-id="3025-9">Zelda</a> had a huge influence on himself and the game.</p><p style="">The player starts the game in the northern parts of Hokkaido, <a href="/japan/3035-37/" data-ref-id="3035-37">Japan</a>, and travels through the game world in linear fashion, saving each area from evil by rejuvenating Guardian Saplings. Ammy (the nickname given to Amaterasu by <a href="/issun/3005-1295/" data-ref-id="3005-1295">Issun</a>) does this primarily with the Celestial Brush, a paintbrush with powers awarded by the 13 brush gods that she meets over the course of the game.</p><p style="">The battle system is rather unique, in that it combines elements of role-playing and action-adventure games. Groups of enemies in the overworld are depicted as scrolls surrounded by plumes of colored fire. When Amaterasu comes in contact with one, a barrier entraps her in a sort of arena. In this arena, the player must fight foes using one of three weapon types: glaives (sword-like, attacks offensively), reflectors (shield-like, acts defensively as a sub-weapon), and rosaries (bead-like weapons for ranged combat). Each can be equipped either as a primary or secondary weapon, allowing one to find a personal combat style. Players receive yen and, on rare occasions, demon fangs, for successfully defeating a group of enemies. Both can be used to buy various consumables, buffs, and upgrades for Amaterasu.</p><h3>The Celestial Brush</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13353/457269-81867_3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-457269" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.752" data-width="250" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 250px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13353/457269-81867_3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-457269"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/13353/457269-81867_3.jpg"></a><figcaption>The Celestial Brush in action. Here, it's calling up a gust of wind.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The brush mechanic in Ōkami is one of the game's most unique aspects. By pressing and holding down R1 (on the PS2 version) or B (on the Wii version), time freezes and the screen seemingly turns into a canvas, although players can still move the camera freely. Using Ammy's tail like a paintbrush, players can paint various symbols over the screen -- which, once the button is released, result in different effects.</p><p style="">Over the course of the game, players collect 16 brush techniques, granted to them by Ammy's peers and fellow gods. Most serve multiple functions, as not only do they help Ammy explore the world and get past obstacles, but they can also be used in battle:</p><ul><li><b>Sunrise:</b> Amaterasu's innate ability, this technique allows her to summon the sun, turning night back to day. Triggered by painting a circle in the sky.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Rejuvenation:</b> Granted by <a href="/yomigami/3005-9610/" data-ref-id="3005-9610">Yomigami</a>, this technique allows Ammy to restore broken objects to their original form, such as repairing broken bridges. Triggered by completely painting over the broken area.</li><li><b>Power Slash:</b> Granted by <a href="/tachigami/3005-9611/" data-ref-id="3005-9611">Tachigami</a>, this technique lets Ammy slash through objects and enemies alike. Triggered by painting a straight, horizontal line over the desired target.</li><li><b>Cherry Bomb:</b> Granted by <a href="/bakugami/3005-9612/" data-ref-id="3005-9612">Bakugami</a>, this technique lets Ammy create a bomb that can be used to open new passages and damage enemies in battle. Triggered by drawing a circle with a line going through one of the edges.</li><li><b>Greensprout: Bloom:</b> Granted by <a href="/sakigami/3005-9609/" data-ref-id="3005-9609">Sakigami</a> -- one of the triumvirate Hanagami flora gods -- this technique causes flowers to bloom and rejuvenates withered trees. Triggered by painting a circle over the flower or tree.</li><li><b>Greensprout: Water Lily:</b> Granted by <a href="/hasugami/3005-9614/" data-ref-id="3005-9614">Hasugami</a> -- another one of the Hanagami flora gods -- this technique allows Ammy to create a path of lily pads on water so that she can cross large bodies of water. Triggered by painting a circle on the water.</li><li><b>Greensprout: Vine:</b> Granted by <a href="/tsutagami/3005-9615/" data-ref-id="3005-9615">Tsutagami</a> -- the last of the Hanagami flora gods -- this technique allows Ammy create a vine that spawns out of Konohana blossom and can be attached to certain objects, or Ammy to reach otherwise inaccessible places. Triggered by painting a line from a Konohana blossom to Amaterasu.</li><li><b>Watersprout:</b> Granted by <a href="/nuregami/3005-9616/" data-ref-id="3005-9616">Nuregami</a>, this technique can be used to move water to different places, and activate Power Springs that can be used to ascend to higher ground. Triggered by either drawing a line from the water to a desired target, or drawing a line straight up from a power spring.</li><li><b>Crescent:</b> Granted by <a href="/yumigami/3005-9617/" data-ref-id="3005-9617">Yumigami</a>, this technique allows Ammy to turn day to night by bringing out the moon. Triggered by drawing a crescent shape in the sky, with the edges pointing left.</li><li><b>Galestorm:</b> Granted by <a href="/kazegami/3005-9618/" data-ref-id="3005-9618">Kazegami</a>, this technique allows Ammy to create gusts of wind. Triggered by drawing a line with a loop in the middle in whichever direction the player want the wind to travel, or a spiral shape to make it go forward.</li><li><b>Inferno:</b> Granted by <a href="/moegami/3005-9619/" data-ref-id="3005-9619">Moegami</a>, this technique lets Ammy move fire to different places, which can be used to melt ice or damage enemies. Triggered by drawing a line from the source of fire to the desired target.</li><li><b>Veil of Mist:</b> Granted by <a href="/kasugami/3005-9620/" data-ref-id="3005-9620">Kasugami</a>, this technique allows Ammy to temporarily slow down time. Triggered by drawing two horizontal lines parallel to each other.</li><li><b>Catwalk:</b> Granted by <a href="/kabegami/3005-9621/" data-ref-id="3005-9621">Kabegami</a>, this technique lets Ammy stick to walls that have cat prints on them. Triggered by drawing a line straight up from a cat statue.</li><li><b>Thunderstorm:</b> Granted by <a href="/gekigami/3005-9622/" data-ref-id="3005-9622">Gekigami</a>, this technique lets Ammy shock enemies or objects with bolts of lightning. Triggered by drawing a line from the source of lightning to the desired target.</li><li><b>Blizzard:</b> Granted by <a href="/itegami/3005-9623/" data-ref-id="3005-9623">Itegami</a>, this technique lets Ammy freeze things or create bridges of ice. Triggered by drawing a line connecting the source of ice to the desired target.</li></ul><p style="">There are also extra techniques and upgraded versions of existing strokes that can be found by completing side quests and exploring the world. These are:</p><ul><li><b>Fireburst:</b> An upgraded version of Inferno, Fireburst allows Ammy to call upon the power of Fire whenever she wants by drawing an infinity symbol (a horizontal 8), and roasts all enemies on screen to a crisp when used in battle.</li><li><b>Whirlwind:</b> An upgraded version of Galestorm, Whirlwind, when activated, calls upon a tornado that continuously damages for the duration it is active. It is activated by drawing three horizontal lines parallel to each other.</li><li><b>Mist Warp:</b> This ability grants Amaterasu the ability to teleport across Nippon via objects known as "Ultimate Origin Mirrors" (otherwise known as save points), by drawing an X upon the mirror's surface.</li><li><b>Fountain:</b> Fountain is similar to Mist Warp in that it allows Amaterasu to quickly teleport across Nippon, but instead of using mirrors to do so, Fountain utilizes Mermaid Springs -- small, glowing sections of water spread throughout Nippon. To use this, Ammy must simply draw a spiral on the spring's surface and subsequently jump in.</li><li><b>Deluge:</b> This technique calls upon a torrent of rain that can be used to damage foes in battle. It is activated by drawing two vertical lines.</li><li><b>Thunderbolt:</b> This ability allows Ammy to summon a large lighting bolt to attack enemies with the power of lighting. It is activated by drawing a lighting bolt.</li><li><b>Icestorm:</b> This one causes icicles to rain down upon enemies. It's activated by drawing an X with a line struck through vertically.</li></ul><p style="">There are also upgrades available for both the Power Slash and Cherry Bomb techniques; the former increasing its proficiency and the latter increasing the number of bombs that can be spawned. Both can be obtained by donating Yen to offertory springs hidden throughout Nippon.</p><h2>Characters</h2><ul><li><b><a href="/amaterasu/3005-897/" data-ref-id="3005-897">Amaterasu</a>:</b> The Goddess of the sun who has taken the form of a wolf, and the game's protagonist.</li><li><b><a href="/issun/3005-1295/" data-ref-id="3005-1295">Issun</a>:</b> Amaterasu's trusty sidekick who isn't much taller than an inch. He does all the talking for you through out the game and fancies himself to be a great artist.</li><li><b><a href="/waka/3005-9280/" data-ref-id="3005-9280">Waka</a>:</b> A mysterious flute player who appears from time to time to test Amaterasu's strength and give prophecies.</li><li><strong><a href="/susano/3005-11967/" data-ref-id="3005-11967"><b>Susano</b></a>:</strong> A warrior descended from <a href="/nagi/3005-11370/" data-ref-id="3005-11370">Nagi</a>. Usually sleeps throughout the day when he's supposed to be honing his swordsmanship. He has feelings for Kushi.</li><li><strong>Kushi:</strong> A sake brewer and beautiful maiden who resides in Kamiki Village.</li><li><b><a href="/orochi/3005-3252/" data-ref-id="3005-3252">Orochi</a>:</b> This evil, eight-headed demon is a major villain in the game.

The game uses <a href="/cel-shading/3015-173/" data-ref-id="3015-173">cel-shaded</a> graphics to emulate the look of traditional Japanese sumi-e brush art. (Sumi-e involves painting with brushes on traditional washi-paper, which is commonly used for calligraphy and making Japanese paper cranes.)</p><p style="">Clover Studio initially intended to employ a more realistic aesthetic in Ōkami, but the <a href="/playstation-2/3045-19/" data-ref-id="3045-19">Playstation 2</a> was deemed too weak to render their original vision. The <a href="/celestial-brush/3055-355/" data-ref-id="3055-355">Celestial Brush</a> mechanic used to draw in the game also influenced the decision to use cel-shading.</p><h2>Wii Port</h2><p style="">In the Wii release, the staff credits were removed from the game. The director of Ōkami, <a href="/hideki-kamiya/3040-60123/" data-ref-id="3040-60123">Hideki Kamiya</a>, stated his thoughts about their removal on a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=16464768311%26amp%3Bref=mf" rel="nofollow">officially translated blog entry,</a> stating, "It was a special staff roll for a special moment. And now it is gone. All of it. ...It’s incredibly disappointing and sad."</p><p style=""><a href="/capcom/3010-367/" data-ref-id="3010-367">Capcom</a> U.S. had this to say in response: "The credits were removed because they were a pre-rendered movie that contained the Clover logo. We have no legal right to use the Clover logo in a game they were not involved with directly. We also didn't have the source to the credit movie itself, so we couldn't just use it and remove the Clover logo." The credits were added for the Japanese release of the game, however, which was more than a year after the game's release in English speaking territories.</p><p style="">The Wii version is infamous for having a not-so-subtly hidden <a href="http://www.ign.com/" rel="nofollow">IGN</a> watermark on its cover that caused Capcom to offer some new cover art for a short while after the discovery was made.</p><h3>Wii port differences</h3><ul><li>Motion controls added for celestial brush and combat</li><li>Paper filter effect removed from the screen</li></ul><h2>Ōkami HD</h2><p style="">An HD port of Ōkami, developed by <a href="/hexa-drive/3010-6576/" data-ref-id="3010-6576">Hexa Drive</a>, was released on the <a href="/playstation-network/3015-2623/" data-ref-id="3015-2623">PlayStation Network</a> on October 30th, 2012 for $20.

Just like the Wii version, it does not have the rice paper filter found in the original PS2 release. Though there is an option to increase the filter to make it look like the original PS2 release. This means the HD version is most likely an up-res of the Wii version with the <a href="/wii-remote/3055-1304/" data-ref-id="3055-1304">Wii remote</a> controls being mimicked with the PlayStation Move.

It functions primarily as a third-person shooter with an <a href="/over-the-shoulder/3015-2621/" data-ref-id="3015-2621">over-the-shoulder</a> perspective, only players cannot simultaneously move and shoot. This then gives the game a more methodical feel that prioritises accuracy and crowd management rather than commonly hunkering behind cover or running &amp; gunning. Though while there is in fact a cover system, it is relatively rudimentary and is only accessible at specific segments -- most notably during when enemies that can shoot back such as Soldier Majini are introduced. When available, players can pop-out to fire, but cannot shimmy along nor dive between different pieces of cover.</p><p style="">For as much as RE5 resembles RE4, it still nonetheless carves out its own identity by way of its faster pace and more action-orientated focus. Puzzles have been near-completely removed, and RE5 has adopted a more modern shooter control scheme that by default has players aim with L1/LB and shoot with R1/RB. Characters can now slowly strafe left or right as well, though amongst the four variable control schemes exists the 'Classic' Type D, which has RE5 control much like RE4. However that also includes removing the player's ability to strafe. A basic map in the top right corner of the screen can be displayed by pressing R2/RT. It won't disclose the information of enemy locations, but will at least visualise the blueprint-like design of the area.</p><p style="">The story is now told almost-exclusively via in-game cutscenes this time around, though nearing the later segments there are still a number of Files (diaries, memos ect.) that shed light on the series' backstory and mythos.</p><p style="">The most notary change from RE4 is the addition of a secondary character that persists throughout the whole game, in both single-player and cooperative formats. (See further below for more details)</p><h3>Inventory &amp; Shop</h3><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637083-resident_evil_5_pc_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2637083" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637083-resident_evil_5_pc_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2637083"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637083-resident_evil_5_pc_02.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637083-resident_evil_5_pc_02.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The in-game inventory display</figcaption></figure><p style="">Possibly the most notable overhaul is the inventory system. Long gone is the tetris-like inventory management of Resident Evil 4, and in its stead is a new format that is presented as a grid made up of nine squares -- each of which can hold any type of weapon or item. Players press triangle/Y to bring up their inventory, where they can then choose to move around their items into whichever square they desire. However inventory management is done in real time, and players cannot move whilst in their inventory leaving them potentially vulnerable to attack. To compensate, players can now once again reload their weapons via their inventory screen--by moving ammo towards the hypothetical weapon square--as opposed to only being able to do so manually like in RE4. Due to the animation-priority concerning certain actions, this allows players to reload their weapons or move items around while the character is climbing a ladder or opening a door for example. The speed with which the inventory menu can be opened &amp; closed attributes to this factor also.</p><p style="">Another benefit is with the use of the d-pad players can select between whatever items they have in the top, left, right, and bottom squares. This thusly allows players to switch between their weapons in real time.</p><p style="">There is no longer a mysterious merchant by which players buy and upgrade their weapons. Instead there is a HUB that the player can use to store unwanted weaponry or ammunition and so forth, and can then use their accumulated gold from killing enemies to potentially buy new weapons or upgrade their current ones. Though not all weapons are available for purchase; some are unlocked as the story progresses, while others are made available once other certain weapons have been fully upgraded. Treasures can once again be collected through the game, be they hidden within the environment or dropped by a powerful enemy, which can be sold in the HUB for additional cash. Treasures cannot be combined like in RE4 for an increase in value, however.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637075-res5_inventory.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2637075" data-ratio="0.62588235294118" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637075-res5_inventory.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2637075"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637075-res5_inventory.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637075-res5_inventory.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Inventory &amp; Cooperative HUB</figcaption></figure><p style="">Players are sent to the HUB whenever they re-enter the story should they have quitted earlier, in-between story chapters, and even when they die. Whatever treasures/weapons/ammunition the player may have collected (or used up, in the case of ammunition) before reaching a hard checkpoint will still persist in the player's inventory when they are sent back to the HUB. Players can also access it via the game's main menu as well.</p><h3>Health &amp; Healing Items</h3><p style="">A character's health is now again represented as 3/4's of a circle; whence damaged, the health of the circle will deplete and change color the more health is lost. A character's extent of health is static and cannot be upgraded with yellow herbs anymore, though there are items that can be equipped to reduce damage.</p><p style="">While yellow herbs are no longer available, green and red still persist and can be combined to increase their effectiveness. A list of herbs and their effectiveness is as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Green Herb</strong> - On its own will heal roughly 25% of health.</li><li><strong>Green + Green Herb</strong> - Mixed will now health roughly 50% of health.</li><li><strong>Green + Red Herb</strong> - Mixed will heal the player character fully.</li><li><strong>Red Herb</strong> - On its own will do nothing.</li></ul><p style="">Besides herbs, first aid sprays are available for use and like always will heal the character fully. Eggs can also be found throughout the game in three varieties:</p><ul><li><strong>White</strong> - Roughly heals about 30% of health</li><li><strong>Brown</strong> - Roughly heals about 40% of health</li><li><strong>Gold</strong> - Heals a character fully.</li></ul><p style="">While they're ordinarily found like any other item, the player will sometimes encounter chickens. If a player scares it enough, be it by aiming or shooting near one, there's a chance it'll lay an egg the player can collect. Snakes also exist within the world (and often like to hide within destructible crates/barrels) that have a chance of dropping an egg whence killed, too.</p><p style="">When healing with a herb mixture or first aid spray it's beneficial that the characters are close by as it will heal them both -- eggs, however, will not. Though they do at least have the advantage of being stackable, with up to five of a single variety being able to fit into a single inventory square.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637076-re5_dying.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2637076" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637076-re5_dying.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2637076"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637076-re5_dying.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637076-re5_dying.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Chris, shown to be in the 'Dying' state.</figcaption></figure><p style="">When a character's health gets into the red the player will visually walk with their hand on their hip with a slight decrease in movement speed. Should a character lose all of their health, however, they will go into the Dying state -- represented by the fourth segment of the circle. When in the Dying state players can only slowly limp while what remains of their dying gauge begins to drop; the only way out of it is if the other character can either heal them with a herb/first aid spray, or will otherwise administer a shot of adrenaline to bring them out of it -- a prompt to do so for both actions will appear on the saviour character's screen. The shot will not heal any health, however, and any attack will throw the character back in the Dying state--if not kill them outright--which will continue to drop from whence it was left before the player was pulled out of it.</p><h3>Cooperative Gameplay</h3><p style="">In-line with the game's bigger emphasis on action, the whole of RE5's story can be played cooperatively for up to two-players. By default player 1 is always Chris Redfield while the second takes control of Sheva Alomar. Though upon completing the game the first player can then choose which character they want to play as. RE5 can be played cooperatively Online, though split-screen and even LAN are available methods also. However there is no drop-in drop-out functionality; whence a new player joins an online game, the game will take both players back to the HUB screen as mentioned before.</p><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637077-resident-evil-5-screenshot-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2637077" data-ratio="0.56276150627615" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637077-resident-evil-5-screenshot-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2637077"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637077-resident-evil-5-screenshot-2.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637077-resident-evil-5-screenshot-2.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Playable story characters Sheva &amp; Chris</figcaption></figure><p style="">Both Chris &amp; Sheva play almost the exact same as one another, and have the same capabilities and can use nearly all of the weapons available in the game, however they each have their own single, exclusive weapon that only they can use. The one major difference between how they each play is their perspective; Chris, like the playable characters of RE4 before him, aims over his right shoulder, whereas Sheva aims over her left. This was done to give the game a more pleasing visual aesthetic in split-screen mode.</p><p style="">There are a number of times throughout the game where the two characters are forced to split-up. This usually involves Sheva, with the help of Chris, leaping over a gap to reach another part of the environment to collect a key item -- while the other may likely be able to provide cover fire. However since the players are split up, they can no longer heal each other nor bring the other back out of the dying state. Though sequences where characters split-up are short-lived.</p><p style="">Players are able to trade supplies such as ammunition and healing items (thought not weapons) between each other both in-game and in the HUB. There is also a small series of in-game commands players can give each other. These are: Go, Wait, Come On, and Thanks. Go, Wait, and Thanks are triggered by holding (by default) the circle/B button down, and then choosing from the three commands with the d-pad; Come On is triggered by simply pressing the circle/B button. Though Thanks can also be triggered this way in response to assistance from the other character, such as after being gifted/traded an item or after being saved from an enemy grappling the player. Pressing circle/B when the player's partner scores a headshot or manages to successfully enact a follow-up melee attack will also have their character compliment their partner.</p><p style="">With the map up, both players will be shown. Though if one player gets out of range of the map, the other player can then hold down L2 directing the player's attention to the location of the other player.</p><h3>Secondary Character AI</h3><p style="">When playing in single-player the secondary character will still persist, but is now controlled by a friendly AI. However it is still just as vulnerable as the player and shares all of the same gameplay mechanics and trappings, including its own 9-square inventory grid. It will often act of its own accord and will fire at whatever enemy it encounters, regardless of how much ammunition it has. It will heal itself when damaged and usually knows which healing item is most suitable, though it will usually rush to the player first to make sure they both get healed -- regardless of whether the player actually requires healing or not. It will also collect supplies on its own, though will at least give some to the player should they feel the player is in need of them, or if it collected ammunition it can't use. Though this may not always be the case.</p><p style="">Fortunately it will gladly trade items with the player when requested and will even always thank the player for any assistance as well. However because it tends to go through ammo relatively quickly, it's advised that the human player equips themselves with different weapons to the AI. Such as for example sticking the AI with an SMG or Assault Rifle while the player uses a Handgun. As it's an AI, its accuracy is very high, thus it excels with Sniper Rifles in particular. While it will use whatever firearms it has at its disposal, it will not use any explosive weapons such as the RPG Launcher, Grenade Launcher, or even grenades.</p><p style="">When the player is forced to split-up with the AI it will follow a specific script, be it collecting the necessary key item or unlocking a door, and will then attempt to regroup with the player ASAP. It will at least attempt to defend itself when necessary, though it will not revert to its default patterns until it is reunited with the player.</p><p style="">Though while it is largely agreed upon by its community that Resident Evil 5 makes for a better experience when playing cooperatively, it's worth noting there is unique dialogue in the single-player version--dialogue that also differs dependant on whether the player is controlling Chris or Sheva--that isn't heard otherwise.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2685869-goodguys.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2685869" data-ratio="0.56666666666667" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2685869-goodguys.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2685869"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2685869-goodguys.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2685869-goodguys.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Chris, Sheva, and Josh</figcaption></figure><p style="">On two occasions the player(s) will be accompanied by BSAA Delta leader, Josh Stone. However he is not playable under any context within the main game and functions as a friendly AI compatriot. Though unlike Sheva, Josh Stone sticks to a script and isn't as dynamic as the player's partner AI. He is often shown trying to work a piece of machinery to help open the way. During the first scenario Josh will defend himself when necessary, equipped with an M9SF pistol, but can also die if he receives enough damage. Though for his second appearance he merely awaits for the players on a boat, and none of the enemies will pay him any heed.</p><p style="">Josh's melee attacks are a carbon copy of Chris', and it wasn't until the DLC story Desperate Escape that Josh was given his own set of unique attacks.</p><h3>Quick Time Events</h3><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661828-gam210.know.act5_b1_1--article_image.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661828" data-ratio="0.5622009569378" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661828-gam210.know.act5_b1_1--article_image.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661828"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661828-gam210.know.act5_b1_1--article_image.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661828-gam210.know.act5_b1_1--article_image.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">QTEs return and are again most commonly encountered should a player be grabbed by an enemy--which'll require the player to wiggle the right analogue--or in the case of bosses to sometimes avoid an attack entirely. They are also encountered during specific cutscenes, where the player must press the on-screen prompts as they appear otherwise they will die. Sometimes players may also have to rapidly tap a single button as well, usually as a means to further illustrate a scene depicting a struggle for example.</p><p style="">If playing cooperatively, cutscene QTEs are divided between players depending on which character is doing the action on-screen. Though there are still some that require both players to press the prompts simultaneously.</p><h3>Melee Combat</h3><p style="">Melee attacks return and have been further expanded upon. When fighting the variety of regular Majini enemies, shooting them in the head, leg, or shoulder will stun them for a couple of seconds, allowing players to then perform a powerful melee attack by way of a prompt next to the stunned enemy. Though depending on which part of the Majini is shot will prompt a different attack -- Chris &amp; Sheva each have unique melee attacks as well. Characters are also invulnerable whilst performing a melee attack, making them suitable for both offence and defense.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637078-st-106.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2637078" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637078-st-106.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2637078"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637078-st-106.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637078-st-106.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Chris, managing to hit two Majini at once with a Right Hook</figcaption></figure><p style="">Certain melee attacks can be chained between characters, with for example Chris enacting one following by Sheva committing another, with Chris unleashing a final third. The third attack of the chain is extremely powerful and cannot be triggered any other way beyond being the final attack of a combo. They will most often be used against the larger enemies, as they tend to stagger rather than get knocked to the ground like common Majini enemies. When playing alone with the AI, it will attempt to chain melee attacks with the player when possible, though it will usually rely on firearms more so than melee attacks.</p><p style="">A list of Chris &amp; Sheva's melee attacks are as follows:</p><h4><strong>Chris:</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Straight Punch</strong> - A straight lung, usually only striking a single enemy but may still knock the enemy far enough to topple over other enemies. Is often comically compared to<a href="/captain-falcon/3005-1215/" data-ref-id="3005-1215"> Captain Falcon</a>'s Falcon Punch attack in <a href="/nintendo/3010-90/" data-ref-id="3010-90">Nintendo</a>'s <a href="/super-smash-bros/3030-19125/" data-ref-id="3030-19125">Super Smash Brothers</a> franchise. Within the context of a regular Majini enemy, it is actionable when it has been shot to the face and is forced to clasp its face.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Right Hook</strong> - Chris' weakest attack, though it has a good chance of hitting multiple enemies and is useful for potentially starting a combo with Sheva. Within the context of a regular Majini enemy, this attack is actionable when it has been shot in the left or right shoulder.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Kick - </strong>Another relatively weak attack, this too is primarily useful for leading into another attack by Sheva. Within the context of a regular Majini enemy, this attack is actionable from behind when it has been shot in the left or right shoulder.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Uppercut - </strong>Roughly about the same power as the Straight Punch, the uppercut has a better chance of hitting multiple enemies. Within the context of a regular Majini enemy, this attack is actionable from the front when it has been shot at the knee and keels over in pain for a few seconds.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Neck Snap</strong> - Chris' most powerful attack as it will kill a regular Majini instantly. Within the context of a regular Majini enemy, this attack is actionable from the back when it has been shot at the knee and keels over in pain for a few seconds.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Stomp - </strong>A very powerful attack, and one that may often act as a finisher due to the damage an enemy may have already received to get knocked over. Within the context of a regular Majini enemy, this attack is actionable when it has been knocked to the ground.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Haymaker</strong> - Besides the Neck Snap, this is easily Chris' most powerful attack. However it can only be performed as the third attack of a combo chain--beginning with Chris--and when directed at an enemy from the front.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Backhand</strong> - Like the Haymaker, this too deals an equally incredible amount of damage. However it can only be performed as the third attack of a combo chain--beginning with Chris--and when directed at an enemy from the back.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Top Down Punch</strong> - A relatively weak attack, this is the attack Chris uses against an enemy that is currently grappling the other character. It visually resembles <a href="/ryu/3005-103/" data-ref-id="3005-103">Ryu</a>'s top down punch from the <a href="/street-fighter-alpha/3025-960/" data-ref-id="3025-960">Street Fighter Alpha</a> series.</li></ul><h4><strong>Sheva:</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Roundhouse Kick</strong> - A reliable manoeuvre due to its high likelihood that it'll disperse a crowd, and can at least knock an enemy over. Within the context of a regular Majini enemy, it is actionable when it has been shot to the face and is forced to clasp its face.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Twist Kick</strong> - Sheva's weakest attack, and is only primarily useful for potentially starting a combo chain with Chris. Within the context of a regular Majini enemy, this attack is actionable when it has been shot in the left or right shoulder.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Knee</strong> - Another relatively weak attack, this too is primarily useful for leading into another attack by Chris. Within the context of a regular Majini enemy, this attack is actionable from behind when it has been shot in the left or right shoulder.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Somersault</strong> - Somewhat reminiscent of <a href="/guile/3005-266/" data-ref-id="3005-266">Guile</a> from Street Fighter's Flask Kick move, Sheva's somersault does a high amount of damage, but will often only manage to hit a single enemy. Within the context of a regular Majini enemy, this attack is actionable from the front when it has been shot at the knee and keels over in pain for a few seconds.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Throat Slice</strong> - Sheva's most powerful attack, as like Chris' Neck Snap will kill a regular Majini instantly. However the animation is noticeably longer overall. Within the context of a regular Majini enemy, this attack is actionable from the back when it has been shot at the knee and keels over in pain for a few seconds.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Impale</strong> - A very powerful attack, even more so than Chris' stomp, and one that may often act as a finisher due to the damage an enemy may have already received to get knocked over. Within the context of a regular Majini enemy, this attack is actionable when it has been knocked to the ground.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Skull Crusher - </strong>Besides the Throat Slice, this is easily Sheva's most powerful attack. However it can only be performed as the third attack of a combo chain--beginning with Sheva--and when directed at an enemy from the front.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Spinning Back Kick</strong> - Like the Skull Crusher, this too deals an equally incredible amount of damage. However it can only be performed as the third attack of a combo chain--beginning with Sheva--and when directed at an enemy from the back.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Pivot Kick</strong> - A relatively weak attack, this is the attack Sheva uses against an enemy that is currently grappling the other character.</li></ul><h2>Story</h2><h3>Main Characters</h3><h4><a href="/chris-redfield/3005-413/" data-ref-id="3005-413">Chris Redfield</a></h4><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/25/10649-ChrisRedfieldRE5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-10649" data-size="small" data-ratio="2.8264758497317" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:282.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/25/10649-ChrisRedfieldRE5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-10649"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/25/10649-ChrisRedfieldRE5.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/25/10649-ChrisRedfieldRE5.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">The leading protagonist and returning hero from the original Resident Evil, Chris is now apart of the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance (of which he is a founding member) heading into Africa to investigate a possible arms deal under way lead by Ricardo Irving.</p><p style="">Now aged at 35, Chris' overall motivations have slipped somewhat and he has begun to question if what he is doing is even making a difference to the world.</p><ul><li>Voiced by <a href="/roger-craig-smith/3040-4136/" data-ref-id="3040-4136">Roger Craig Smith.</a></li><li>Motion captured by <a href="/reuben-langdon/3040-40654/" data-ref-id="3040-40654">Reuben Langdon</a>.</li></ul><h4><a href="/sheva-alomar/3005-1085/" data-ref-id="3005-1085">Sheva Alomar</a></h4><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4432/607207-re5_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-607207" data-size="small" data-ratio="2.1944444444444" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:219.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4432/607207-re5_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-607207"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4432/607207-re5_1.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4432/607207-re5_1.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">An all new character, Sheva is a native of West Africa, a part of the B.S.A.A. branch stationed there.

However he is rescued by a woman concealed by a bird mask and cloak. The duo are thusly forced to continue the chase.</p><p style="">Upon meeting up with B.S.A.A. member <a href="/dave-johnson/3005-15420/" data-ref-id="3005-15420">Dave Johnson</a>, they hitch a ride on his humvee. Though upon their arrival at the next checkpoint, they are ambushed by a massive creature called N'desu. It kills Dave, but is then taken down thanks to the weaponry located on the humvee by Chris and Sheva. After travelling through a Tribal Village that has also been infected with the Las Plagas, with the return of Josh they are then able to finally reach Irving once more on his yacht.</p><p style="">However, Irving injects himself with a Master Plagas sample, rapidly transforming himself into a humongous, amphibious monster. With the use of the gatling and rocket turrets on his boat, the two are able to kill it. Barely hanging on to life, what remains of Irving--who was functioning as the uvula of the creature--upon realising the male agent that killed was Chris Redfield, states the two should head to the nearby cave and look for an ''<a href="/excella-gionne/3005-8921/" data-ref-id="3005-8921">Excella</a>''.</p><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1689389-re5dx9__218_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1689389" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1689389-re5dx9__218_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1689389"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1689389-re5dx9__218_.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1689389-re5dx9__218_.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Excella Gionne</figcaption></figure><p style="">Taking his advice, Josh ferries them to the cave, but then departs once again to try and locate help. Chris &amp; Sheva fight their way through the cave, which is infested with more Las Plagas-infected tribesman. They eventually are introduced to Excella, the CEO of Tricell who are in fact a B.S.A.A. benefactor. Like Irving she continually gives them the slip. Upon their chase, Chris discovers that Jill Valentine may actually be alive; footage of her in a test beacon is found on an Umbrella computer. Chris demands answers from Excella, but she instead unleashes a huge crab-like B.O.W. Though this too is bested by the combined skill of Chris and Sheva.</p><p style="">Upon reaching Excella within an underground temple, Chris' arch-nemesis Albert Wesker reveals himself, alongside the woman wearing the bird mask. The woman is also then revealed to be Jill Valentine, however she is shown to be a puppet of Wesker and follows his command.</p><p style="">While Excella leaves the scene, Wesker opts to engage in a two-vs-two fight; Chris &amp; Sheva vs Wesker &amp; Jill. Wesker, however, still retains all of his super-human agility and strength, and cannot be fought by normal means. As such, Sheva attempts to keep Jill occupied--whom while is incredibly aggressive is still only human--while Chris lures Wesker into the side corridors of the temple. From there he uses stealth to catch Wesker off guard, doing whatever damage he can. Eventually, Wesker is forced to draw the fight to a premature close due to other business, but leaves Jill to finish them off.</p><p style="">Jill soon reveals by opening up her battlesuit that she is being controlled by a strange virus that is continually being pumped into her system. Upon Chris using his voice to remind her of him, he is able to temporarily confuse her enough so as to try and tear the device off. With the help of Sheva, they are finally able to tear the thing off completely. While back to her normal self Jill is still in a weakened state, and urges them to go and stop Wesker without her. But only before she indulges vital information regarding Wesker's own virus; by over-dosing him with a specific serum, that'll then course it to act as a poison. She also reveals Wesker's plan to use jets to unleash Uroborus upon the world. With this information in hand, Chris &amp; Sheva go after Wesker.</p><p style="">Upon arriving on Wesker's battleship, they encounter Excella. However it turns out that she was betrayed by Wesker and infected with Uroborus so as to slow the two down. Excella begins to vomit out black-as-night tentacles, which envelop her as well as a small mountain of corpses nearby Wesker must have placed.</p><p style="">It grows large enough to practically encompass the entire ship, though with the use of a portable ion cannon Chris &amp; Sheva are able to destroy the creature, while also finding the aforementioned serum in Excella's briefcase amidst it all.</p><p style="">The two again catch up to Wesker and do battle with him in the hanger; amidst the fight Wesker's explains his motivation to create a new world order via natural selection with Uroborus. With the use of an RPG, they are able to weaken him enough so as to inject the serum. However is able to escape onto a jet; Chris and Sheva soon join him and another battle occurs, with Sheva injecting Wesker with the serum once more.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1689480-re5dx9__306_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1689480" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1689480-re5dx9__306_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1689480"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1689480-re5dx9__306_.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1689480-re5dx9__306_.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Chris, Jill, and Sheva after another day's work</figcaption></figure><p style="">The jet ultimately crash lands near a volcano during the chaos inside. All three managed to survive the crash, with Wesker now morphing himself with Uroborus. Though unlike past subjects, Wesker's DNA is proven to be compatible, so he retains free-will while also mostly keeping to a humanoid-appearance.</p><p style="">Chris &amp; Sheva split-up so as to confuse, and then regroup upon a small hill. From there they are able to weaken Wesker's heart-like orifice; Wesker then eventually falls into the lava below. Amidst the battle, Josh and Jill arrive via helicopter and pick up Chris and Sheva. Wesker then gives one last attempt at Chris' life, but is then killed once and for all when Chris &amp; Sheva--each equipped with an RPG--destroy him.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><table><tbody><tr><th>Pistols</th></tr><tr><td><h3>M92F</h3><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14440/1286682-beretta_m92fs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1286682" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.68016194331984" data-width="247" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 247px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:68.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14440/1286682-beretta_m92fs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1286682"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14440/1286682-beretta_m92fs.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14440/1286682-beretta_m92fs.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>M92F</figcaption></figure> Main page: <a href="/m9-pistol/3055-940/" data-ref-id="3055-940">M9 Pistol</a><br /><b>Firepower</b>: 150 -

The Majini will no longer make use of any weapons they previously used and will instead use the plagas almost like a whip to swipe the player. Because of the many skittering legs that litter the plagas, simply being too close to the mutated Majini can inflict damage without the Majini actually initiating an attack. Damage to the plagas host is now largely ineffective, and the Majini from then on is most vulnerable by shooting the plagas itself.</p><h4>Kipepeo</h4><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637096-re5-kipepeo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2637096" data-ratio="1.0227272727273" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:102.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637096-re5-kipepeo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2637096"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637096-re5-kipepeo.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637096-re5-kipepeo.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">The second most common mutation, and another that is largely ported from one such Ganado mutation in Resident Evil 4. This one is a form a flying plagas that bursts out of the Majini's back once it has received enough damage.

Otherwise it is relatively weak and can be taken down in groups easy with a few accurate shotgun rounds.</p><h4>Duvalia</h4><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637097-duvalia.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2637097" data-ratio="1.4" data-width="250" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 250px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:140.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637097-duvalia.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2637097"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637097-duvalia.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637097-duvalia.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Only encountered against the soldier Majini, the Duvalia, as is custom with mutations, occurs once the Majini has received so much damage.

The entire upper-half of the Majini is enclosed within an impenetrable shell, with the vulnerable 'mouth' residing with. The Duvalia will primarily try to whack the player using its shell, but given the chance should the player get close enough will open its shell and 'chomp' the player, instantly placing the player in the dying state. The only way to kill it is to shoot the lower regions of the Majini, forcing the Duvalia to fall onto its knees with the shell open, then shooting the inside.</p><h4>Explosion</h4><p style="">While not a mutation per se, sometimes a soldier Majini will quickly begin to boil and eventually explode after it has taken enough damage.</p><h3>Bui Kichwa</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234135-bui_kichwa.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234135" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.85470085470085" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:85.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234135-bui_kichwa.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234135"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234135-bui_kichwa.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234135-bui_kichwa.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">While they were originally meant to be another Majini mutation, for the final game they are instead only encountered independently. Resembling a sort of exotic arachnid, their main attack is to quickly latch around the player. They do minimal damage, but they also restrict the player to only walking as they struggle to remove the Kichwa. This then allows other enemies in the vicinity to more easily attack the player.</p><p style="">They are otherwise dispatched easily enough with just one or two pistol rounds. Because of their small size, however, they are often able to strike outside of the player's view catching them off-guard.</p><h3>Adjule</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234143-cerberusre5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234143" data-size="small" data-ratio="1" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234143-cerberusre5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234143"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234143-cerberusre5.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234143-cerberusre5.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Infected Doberman dogs, these are mostly encountered during the stages set in the Kijuju village and on Wesker's ship deck .

Though unlike Salvador, before Chainsaw Majini strike they tend to laugh manically often giving the player an added second to escape the Majini's attack range.</p><p style="">There are two versions of the Chainsaw Majini distinguished by the color of their trousers. The Chainsaw Majini wearing red, once killed, will stay dead. The ones wearing blue, however, once bested will soon get up and begin to flail madly with their Chainsaw making them much more so dangerous than usual. To compensate, their health is kept to be relatively low during this phase.</p><h3>Executioner Majini</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234146-executioner.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234146" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.0625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:106.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234146-executioner.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234146"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234146-executioner.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234146-executioner.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Huge, intimidating lumbering Majini, these are only encountered once during the main game, though are much more prevalent in other areas of the game including the Mercenaries modes and Desperate Escape DLC story.</p><p style="">Wielding a massive hammer, they will pull it along the ground and slowly slam it unto the player should the player be close enough. The attack itself will empty a character's entire health bar, leaving them in the dying state. Besides that, the Executioner may also pick up the player forcing them to quickly tap a button to escape, or to rely on their partner to save them. If neither is successful, the Executioner throws the player to the ground and will execute and kill the player instantly - ignoring the dying state completely.</p><p style="">There is another variant encountered only in the Prison map for the Mercenaries modes.

They are still highly resistance to damage all the same, however.</p><p style="">Using their large mace for attacks, they will most often swing it within close proximity doing severe damage to players caught within range.

Chomping on a cigar, sporting aviators and a beret, these Majini's are understandably only encountered amongst the soldier Majini.

Reapers are pretty much indestructible lest the player shoots their weak points, which are littered across the back of the Reaper and will sporadically expose themselves only for a second. Should the player manage to shoot one of the weak points, the Reaper keels over revealing two more weak points, finally resulting in the Reaper bending backwards to reveal its most vulnerable region within the middle of its carapace.</p><p style="">If the player shoots anywhere else besides one of the telegraphed weak points, the Reaper emits a mist which clouds the player's vision of the Reaper. Because of their high demand for precise timing to kill it, and the fact that they can swiftly kill a player instantly should they get close enough, Reapers are arguably one of the most antagonizing enemies of the game.</p><h3>Licker β</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234145-lickerb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234145" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.57857142857143" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:57.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234145-lickerb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234145"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234145-lickerb.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234145-lickerb.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Primarily recognised for their appearance in <a href="/resident-evil-2/3030-9418/" data-ref-id="3030-9418">Resident Evil 2</a>, Licker β's are an advanced form of Lickers that have been injected with the progenitor virus. While they largely look the same, they are noticeably bigger in mass with more muscle. The most notary difference is for their resistance to bullets, allowing them to withstand copious amounts of firearm fire. Unlike the original Lickers, however, Licker β's have one particular weakness: Their exposed heart. Because of this, should the player manage to knock a Licker onto its back, they can then commit and instant kill by way of a button prompt allowing them to stab the Licker directly in its heart. One other weakness they have inherited over their predecessors is their inability to see. Though they have highly acute hearing, it is possible during some occasions for the player to avoid combat with Lickers altogether as long as they walk past without firing their weapons.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234162-licker4__article_image.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234162" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5622009569378" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234162-licker4__article_image.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234162"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234162-licker4__article_image.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234162-licker4__article_image.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Licker β's still attack using the same array of moves, including their tongue which they now use to pierce a character's shoulder continually draining the character's health the longer it stays. Their large claws are also an asset Licker's will often use given the chance if a player is close enough, or sometimes they will even leap across the air - potentially grabbing the player and killing them instantly by stabbing them if the player's partner can't save them in time. One final similarity Licker β's have with their predecessors is the ability to maneuver across flat surfaces, crawling up walls and across ceilings.</p><h3>Guardian of Insanity</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/100000/1454610-thekeeperofmadnessresidentevil5goldedition_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1454610" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.2690355329949" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:126.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/100000/1454610-thekeeperofmadnessresidentevil5goldedition_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1454610"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/10/100000/1454610-thekeeperofmadnessresidentevil5goldedition_2.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/10/100000/1454610-thekeeperofmadnessresidentevil5goldedition_2.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Only encountered during the Lost in Nightmares story DLC, the Guardians of Insanity are an iteration of the Executioner Majini seen during Resident Evil 5. They lumber around carrying large anchors rather than hammers, however, and are also much more resistant to gunfire. Shooting them forces them to temporarily bleed acid, which does minimal damage but will also stun the player if caught within the splash. The most suitable tactic for beating the creatures is to shoot the small eye it has located on the back on its large hump.</p><p style="">Unlike the Executioners, should a Guardian manage to grab the player, they need their partner to save them otherwise the player currently grabbed will die - no QTE's to allow them to escape the Guardian's grasp.</p><h3>Crocodiles</h3><p style="">While not infected, the native crocodiles of West Africa are much more so aggressive than average crocs. They are only encountered during the marshlands: First whilst the player is riding a raft, as the crocodiles attempt to bite them, and secondly as the player is traversing waist-high water to reach a small settlement of huts. On the raft they can only be avoided via QTE's, but when travelling through the water they can be killed. The crocodiles are unusually sturdy against gunfire, however, and should they get close enough can kill the player instantly.</p><h2>Boss Battles</h2><h3>Uroboros Test Subject</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234175-re5_uroboros_concept.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234175" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.65217391304348" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:65.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234175-re5_uroboros_concept.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234175"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234175-re5_uroboros_concept.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234175-re5_uroboros_concept.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Unleashed by Ricardo Irving after the B.S.A.A.

It takes two attempts to kill it using this method, but would still save players a great degree of supplies.</p><h3>Popokarimu</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234177-popocarimre5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234177" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.0769230769231" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:107.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234177-popocarimre5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234177"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234177-popocarimre5.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234177-popocarimre5.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">A Bio-Organic Weapon that was being transported to be sold, it is accidentally let loose during a vehicular crash. The Popkarimu is faced twice: First on the outskirts of a mining station, and then again while Chris &amp; Sheva are exploring a series of underground African caves. The first time is mandatory, though the second may be avoided if the player can manage to outrun it. For both appearances the boss fight plays out the same.</p><p style="">Resembling a giant bat with a scorpions tail, it will switch between chasing the player on the ground, and hounding the player from the air. Popokarimu's front is impenetrable from gunfire, though its rear up its tail is highly vulnerable. The most suitable strategy is for the player to lay down mines; after the Popokarimu comes in vicinity, the explosion will knock it over giving the player ample time to fire at its weak point. Otherwise, if its a cooperative game, one player can always act as bait while the other shoot at its rear.</p><h3>Ndesu</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234174-ndesure5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234174" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.25" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:125.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234174-ndesure5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234174"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234174-ndesure5.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234174-ndesure5.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">The successor to El Gigante from Resident Evil 4, Ndesu is Tricell's counterpart. Though it looks similar in appearance, it differs in that it has multiple Las Plagas parasites within rather than a single large Plagas like El Gigante. Unlike in Resident Evil 4 where El Gigante's was faced on foot, Ndesu is fought whilst Chris and Sheva are in a B.S.A.A. Humvee using turrets.</p><p style="">It attacks using similar such tactics as its El Gigante brethren; with its brute strength it attempts to smash and stamp down on the Humvee, while also picking up power posts and even a boulder to throw at the vehicle. The player is tasked with continually shooting at whatever Ndesu equips to quickly cause him to flinch so he'll drop his weapon. Besides Ndesu there are a small squadron of Kijuju Majin that'll attack the player with molotovs or by using their crossbows. They are easily dispatched thanks to the turret's power, however another group will always return after an allotted time until the battle is over.</p><p style="">After it takes so much damage, the many Las Plagas within erupt out of its skin. Once they've been killed, Ndesu keels over for a much larger parasite to expose itself out of its back giving players the chance to finally shoot at its weak point. After 2-3 assaults on the main Las Plagas parasite, Ndesu is finally killed.</p><h3>Ricardo Irving</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234172-re5_194.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234172" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.664" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:66.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234172-re5_194.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234172"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2234172-re5_194.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2234172-re5_194.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Because of his failure at stopping Chris &amp; Sheva's pursuit, Jill Valentine currently in her 'Bird Lady' outfit hands Irving a vial with a Master Plagas sample, and orders him to use it should he be cornered. As such, once Chris &amp; Sheva manage to finally catch up to Irving on his luxury boat, he gives in to the potential power a Master Plagas would give and injects himself with it.</p><p style="">It only takes seconds for the parasite to cause Ricardo to mutate; after leaping into the water, Irving soon resurfaces as a monstrously huge amphibious creature. Because this is the work of a Master Plagas, Irving has complete control over his actions. To fight back against the beast, players must use the turrets conveniently located on Irving's boat. Two miniguns and two rocket launchers, players are to shoot at the glowing weak point until it submerges and its tendrils pop out in exchange. Occasionally, it will swim up to attempt to bite the player with its gigantic maw; a button prompt will quickly appear so as the player can avoid the attack. Soon after so much punishment, the creature latches onto the boat as Ricardo, now essentially functioning as the uvula of the monster, reveals himself so as the player can shoot him. After so many attempts, the beast soon spits out Ricardo's body as it dies. Ricardo then soon follows as his sack-like body disintegrates.</p><h3>U-8</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234173-u8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234173" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.56105263157895" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234173-u8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234173"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234173-u8.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234173-u8.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">The U standing for 'Ultimate', U-8 is a massive crab-like B.O.W. Excella Gionne unleashes to attempt to kill Chris &amp; Sheva. Acting as a blockade stopping the elevator they're currently on from descending any further, the duo have no choice but to fight against the U-8. Because of its size, its mass stretches across nearly half the size of the elevator; its weak points are the patches of fleshy skin along its claw, however should the player get close, U-8 will often attempt to strafe around the elevator.</p><p style="">Once enough damage has been done, it will eventually collapse onto the elevator with its mouth agape. This then gives the chance for players to unload at the mouth. Alternatively, players can throw a grenade down its throat (which triggers a small cutscene) to do maximum damage. Each grenade hurled in breaks apart of the armor covering U-8's head, allowing more opportunities to do significant damage. U-8 attacks by performing long range slices with its claws, which'll open a button prompt to help players avoid in time. It will also eventually summon a small array of flying insects to pester players and knock them off their aim when they're shooting U-8's weak points.</p><h3>Uroboros Mkono</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234171-mkono.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234171" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.71444444444444" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:71.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234171-mkono.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234171"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234171-mkono.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234171-mkono.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">The second helping of Uroboros comes courtesy of Excella Gionne, who once against attempts to halter Chris &amp; Sheva's advance. Though unlike their first encounter, this one is much stronger and there are no conveniently placed furnaces nearby either. Instead players are given multiple gas canisters to drop, along with a flamethrower. The gas canisters, once dropped, will become melded with Uroboros should it move nearby one allowing the player to better maximise the fiery damage potential inflicted. The flamethrower is first stationed on the wall; it has limited ammo, and once used up must be returned so it can be refuelled.</p><p style="">Tactics for this encounter work pretty much the exact same as the last one and players must use the various fire-related weaponry at their disposal for Uroboros to reveal its weak points. The flamethrower using during the battle is strictly for this battle alone; once it's finished, the player cannot take it with them.</p><h3>Albert Wesker &amp; Jill Valentine</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234225-resident_evil_5_conceptart_z7b45.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234225" data-size="small" data-ratio="2.5316455696203" data-width="237" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 237px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:253.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234225-resident_evil_5_conceptart_z7b45.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234225"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234225-resident_evil_5_conceptart_z7b45.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234225-resident_evil_5_conceptart_z7b45.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">After much travel and many B.O.W. creatures killed, Chris &amp; Sheva finally manage to catch up to Excella. However, Albert Wesker soon reveals himself to the duo along with a brainwashed Jill Valentine. Wesker finally decides to settle the score with Chris, and along with Jill, they have a two vs two battle inside an underground temple.</p><p style="">Despite the circumstances, Jill Valentine is not to be killed and it will result in a game over should that happen. She will have no qualms about attempting to kill the player, however. Albert Wesker of course shares the same philosophy. Ordinarily the player is to try and survive for seven minutes, though the player can also attempt to fight Wesker and should they do enough damage, Wesker will cut the current battle short and leave.</p><p style="">Albert Wesker because of his increased strength and agility is able to avoid nearly all weaponry fire, and can move about the environment considerably faster than the player. His choice of attack is to quickly charge in and use melee attacks against the player; sometimes he will also swiftly pull out his H&amp;K P8 and shoot two rounds at the player, though the player is given button prompts to avoid the shots. The most reliable strategy to beating Wesker during this stage is to run away; after so long has passed, or if the player heads near the door, Wesker will kick the player through it giving access to the upper floor and its corridors. From there the player can attempt to get some distance between them and Wesker, take cover, and then quickly pop out and shoot him. The same works if one player is able to distract him while another attempts to shoot his back.</p><p style="">Jill Valentine primarily uses her dual VZ61 submachine guns as she effortlessly scurries throughout the environment. It's advised that one player attempts to keep her busy by throwing a flash grenade or the knife to stun her, then do a context-sensitive melee attack knocking her out temporarily. Despite her fondness for her submachine guns, she will still make use of her acrobatic abilities to attack the player should they get close enough.</p><p style="">Should the player manage to do enough damage, or if the seven minutes run out, Wesker leaves and the current battle ends. Though if the player manages to beat Wesker by inflicting too much damage, a unique treasure is then dropped within the area.</p><h3>Jill Valentine Part II</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234233-jillbattlesuit.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234233" data-size="small" data-ratio="1" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234233-jillbattlesuit.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234233"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234233-jillbattlesuit.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234233-jillbattlesuit.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Once Albert Wesker has left, he then leaves it to the still brainwashed Jill Valentine to finish Chris &amp; Sheva after revealing the device on her chest that is the source of her behaviour. Jill functions much like she did during the previous battle against her and Wesker. She will scurry around almost like a wild animal--she will even hiss on occasion--while using her submachine guns and her athletic melee attacks to kill the player.</p><p style="">The player is a still not to kill Jill and must now attempt to use Chris' voice to 'awaken' Jill by using the A/X (default 360/PS3 controls) while avoiding her attacks; should the player be playing as Sheva in single-player, pressing A/X will still automatically have Chris call out to Jill. Once Chris manages to temporarily get through to her, the device begins to malfunction giving the players time to try and rip the device off. Though when this happens, the player is given two possible choices on how to respond: The player can either use a melee attack, knocking Jill to the ground, and then attempt to pull off the device that way, or one player (or the AI) can grab a hold of Jill while the other player (or AI) can attempt to rip the device off.</p><p style="">The first option is more effective and will require less tries, though tearing off the device by using the second option will award the player with a trophy/achievement.</p><h3>Uroboros Aheri</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234170-aheri.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234170" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.69868995633188" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:69.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234170-aheri.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234170"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234170-aheri.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234170-aheri.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">What was once the beautiful Excella Gionne, Albert Wesker's betrayal has forced her to become a monstrously huge Uroboros creature. After absorbing a small mount of corpses, the third encounter with Uroboros quickly grows to the entire size of the ship cruiser. At first Chris &amp; Sheva retreat back into the ship during a small QTE sequence; once they arrive back inside the ship, the players only interaction with Uroboros is by avoiding its many surprise attacks.</p><p style="">Eventually they reach the back of the ship, and along with a portable Ion Cannon weapon do battle with the monster. First the player is to shoot the exposed bulbs, while avoiding its reactionary attacks via a button prompt, and after they've all been extinguished, the 'brain' of the creature is exposed giving players the opportunity to use the Ion Cannon to shoot at it. All the while, Aheri will continuously spawn small Uroboros monsters; they're relatively weak and should often be left as duty for the other player.</p><h3>Albert Wesker Part II</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234290-123491_728348_wesker_noglasses_la.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234290" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.0933333333333" data-width="300" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 300px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:109.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234290-123491_728348_wesker_noglasses_la.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234290"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234290-123491_728348_wesker_noglasses_la.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234290-123491_728348_wesker_noglasses_la.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Fighting near a runway, Chris &amp; Sheva have finally caught up to Wesker and are planning to inject him with a serum that'll neutralize the virus that enhances his strength and agility. Wesker still uses the same sort of attacks as he did when fighting against him previously, though the tactics for beating him have changed. Now players are to turn off the lights so as to stay hidden from Wesker; using an RPG, they are to then shoot at Wesker, who will often grab a hold of it just before it hits him, then shoot the rocket, and finally attempt to inject the serum.</p><p style="">It usually takes around 3-4 tries before it's finally successful. Between each attempt, however, the player must find other rockets littered about the environment, and then the other player (or AI) must help reload it. After the first attempt, Wesker will then start throwing missiles at the player, but his usual array of attacks revolving around his enhanced agility are what fill out the most of his tactics.</p><p style="">A similar fight against Wesker also occurs at the end of the Lost in Nightmares story DLC that takes place during the flashback when Chris &amp; Jill are exploring Ozwell E. Spencer's current residence. Though naturally he doesn't have any missiles to throw. Like the battle against both Wesker &amp; Jill, this battle can either end two ways. Either the hidden timer will end, forcing the cutscene to trigger, or the player will be able to do enough damage that it will end prematurely. If players manage to beat Wesker by way of inflicting enough damage, they are awarded a trophy/achievement.</p><h3>Albert Wesker Part III</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234299-big_boss_of_the_day_resident_evils_albert_wesker_20100216014010447_000.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234299" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.3521126760563" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:135.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234299-big_boss_of_the_day_resident_evils_albert_wesker_20100216014010447_000.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234299"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234299-big_boss_of_the_day_resident_evils_albert_wesker_20100216014010447_000.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234299-big_boss_of_the_day_resident_evils_albert_wesker_20100216014010447_000.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">The final battle located within a volcano - Wesker has now allowed a containment of Uroboros to meld with his DNA, only this time Uroboros actually agrees with its host's DNA. As such, Wesker has full control of his enhanced powers and abilities. His appearance is still altered, however, as the majority of his upper-body is enveloped in the traditional black tentacles that Uroboros is made of.</p><p style="">This fight goes through a small number of stages. First, the player is to run away until Chris &amp; Sheva are inadvertently split up. One player is then forced to keep on running while the other must gain Wesker's attention from afar. Sheva will be running alongside a small pathway while Chris is further below. Reagardless of whom Wesker decides to follow, it's up to the other to safeguard them while either: Sheva is attempting to climb back up after apart of the pathway crumbles beneath her feet, or while Chris is attempting to move a boulder out of his way. Then when both characters are reunited, the player is to lead Wesker up to a small hilltop. From there the ending battle begins.</p><p style="">Players are intended to shoot Wesker in his heart-like orifice which is initially exposed within his back. After enough shots, it will also become visible from his chest as well. Wesker attacks using his Uroboros arms as whips, while also attempting to grapple players; should a player be grabbed, they'll need the assistance of their partner to escape.</p><p style="">To beat Wesker, players could simply follow the routine of shooting his heart. However, once Wesker is stunned, player's can instead choose to run forward and initiate a QTE event showing Chris &amp; Sheva stab at his heart from both sides -- eventually resulting in the player winning the battle. Wesker is then ultimately killed when the player shoots him with an RPG launcher via a button prompt during the following cutscene.</p><h2>Unlockables</h2><p style="">Several <a href="/unlockables/3015-1414/" data-ref-id="3015-1414">unlockables</a> can be achieved in Resident Evil 5, most if not all are gained when finishing the game once, and most of which are achieved by a separate shop system using points gained from performance in the story mode or Mercenaries at the end of the game. Points are then spent for several unlockables listed below.</p><h3>Filters</h3><p style="">All filters can be unlocked at the end of the game by purchasing them from the "Bonus Features" menu option for the cost of 0 points. Filters add to the visuals of the game in several different ways and can be accessed by the "Special Settings" menu option.

Based around arena combat, the player is to kill as many enemies as they can within the time limit; killing enemies within quick succession will start up a combo meter, which often leads to a substantial amount of points. Beginning with 2:00 minutes, the players can extend their time by locating the many time bonuses hidden throughout the map; any enemies killed via a melee attack will also reward the player with a 5 second bonus. Josh Stone acts as the announcer for both the beginning and ending of a Mercenaries match.</p><p style="">Leaderboards are available for players to show off their scores, and filters can be set to allow players to see their overall ranking worldwide, or to see how well they've done when compared against their friends.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/917927-mercenaries_010.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-917927" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/917927-mercenaries_010.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-917927"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/30/917927-mercenaries_010.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/30/917927-mercenaries_010.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>One of the time bonuses in the Public Assembly map</figcaption></figure><p style="">For each of the different maps, there exist mini-bosses taken from the main game who will appear sporadically. Such examples would be The Executioner for <i>The Public Assembly</i> and <i>Prison</i> maps, to the Chainsaw Wielding Majinis for the <i>Ship Deck</i> map. Killing these foes gains the player a sizeable point bonus, as well a 100% chance to drop some added supplies, be it a first-aid spray or some ammunition. Once a player's health reaches the ''dying'' state, they are to tap the O/B (default PS3/360 controls) quickly so they can regenerate their health back to its minimum.</p><p style="">Once time has run out, the player is then scored from D to SS (SS requiring above 90K) based upon their performance, which is graded on not only how many overall enemies the player killed, but also how high their combo meter reached. Should the player die, however, they are not given any rank and must try again.</p><h3>Cooperative Gameplay</h3><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2636882-resident-evil-5-mercenaries-mode.png" data-ref-id="1300-2636882" data-ratio="0.51020408163265" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:51.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2636882-resident-evil-5-mercenaries-mode.png" data-ref-id="1300-2636882"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2636882-resident-evil-5-mercenaries-mode.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2636882-resident-evil-5-mercenaries-mode.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Mercenaries can also be played with a friend, via online, split-screen, or even system-link. With another player, they can still make use of the same list of characters and can both even play as the same one should they choose. Because there are now two players, one player cannot tap O/B to regenerate their health should they fall into the ''dying'' state, and will require the other player to heal them. Scores required to reach ranks are also doubled to account for the other player at hand as well.</p><p style="">Much like during the story, the player can use the O/B button's to call out for their ally, with various ad-libs depending on the situation. Each character has been fitted with their own unique dialogue as well - including Wesker, who will often shout out ''Useless!'' should the other player perish in a 2-player round.</p><h3><b>Characters:</b></h3><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Character</th><th scope="col">Starting Inventory</th><th scope="col">Unlock with an A or higher Rank on:</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Chris Redfield (B.S.A.A.)</strong></td><td><ul><li>M92F Handgun w/ 20 Rounds</li><li>Ithaca M37 Shotgun w/ 20 Rounds</li><li>5 Hand Grenades</li><li>50 Handgun Bullets</li><li>10 Shotgun Shells</li><li>First Aid Spray</li></ul></td><td>Unlocked by default.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Chris Redfield (Safari)</strong></td><td><ul><li>SIG P226 Handgun w/ 16 Rounds</li><li>M3 Shotgun w/ 10 Rounds</li><li>RPG Launcher</li><li>RPG Launcher</li><li>30 Handgun Bullets</li><li>10 Shotgun Shells</li></ul></td><td>Village map.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Chris Redfield (S.T.A.R.S.)</strong></td><td><ul><li>SIG 556 Assault Rifle w/ 65 bullets</li><li>S&amp;W M29 Magnum w/ 12 bullets</li><li>Grenade Launcher w/ 12 Electric Grenades</li><li>150 Machinegun Bullets</li><li>6 Magnum Bullets</li></ul></td><td>Experimental Facility map.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sheva Alomar (B.S.A.A.)</strong></td><td><ul><li>M92F Pistol w/ 40 rounds.</li><li>VZ61 Machinepistol w/ 150 rounds.</li><li>Dragunov Sniper Rifle w/ 13 Rounds</li><li>50 Handgun Bullets</li><li>150 Machinegun Bullets</li><li>First Aid Spray</li></ul></td><td>Unlocked by default.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sheva Alomar (Clubbin')</strong></td><td><ul><li>AK74 Assault Rifle w/ 50 Rounds</li><li>Jail Breaker Shotgun w/ 8 Rounds</li><li>S75 Sniper Rifle w/ 20 Rounds</li><li>100 Machinegun Bullets</li><li>20 Shotgun Shells</li><li>10 Sniper Rifle Bullets</li></ul></td><td>Ancient Ruins map.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sheva Alomar (Tribal)</strong></td><td><ul><li>Bow w/ Infinite Ammo</li><li>Grenade Launcher w/ 6 Ice Rounds</li><li>3 Flame Grenades</li><li>3 Flash Grenades</li><li>First Aid Spray</li></ul></td><td>Missile Area map.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Jill Valentine (B.S.A.A.)</strong></td><td><ul><li>PX4 Handgun w/ 25 Rounds</li><li>H&amp;K MP5 Submachine Gun w/ 150 Rounds</li><li>5 Flash Grenades</li><li>50 Handgun Bullets</li><li>150 Machinegun Bullets</li><li>First Aid Spray</li></ul></td><td>Public Assembly map.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Jill Valentine (Battle Suit)</strong></td><td><ul><li>VZ61 Machinepistol w/ 300 Rounds</li><li>H&amp;K PSG1 Sniper Rifle w/ 9 Rounds</li><li>3 Hand Grenades</li><li>150 Machinegun Bullets</li><li>30 Sniper Rifle Bullets</li><li>Mixed Herb made up of 2 Green</li></ul></td><td>Ship Deck map.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Albert Wesker (Midnight)</strong></td><td><ul><li>H&amp;K P8 Handgun w/ 15 Rounds</li><li>S&amp;W M500 Magnum w/ 6 Rounds</li><li>5 Hand Grenades</li><li>5 Proximity Mines</li><li>50 Handgun Bullets</li><li>5 Magnum Bullets</li></ul></td><td>The Mines map.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Albert Wesker (S.T.A.R.S.)</strong></td><td><ul><li>Samurai Edge Handgun w/ 15 Rounds</li><li>Hydra Shotgun w/ 6 Rounds</li><li>Lightning Hawk Magnum w/ 8 Rounds</li><li>30 Handgun Bullets</li><li>10 Shotgun Shells</li></ul></td><td>Prison map.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3><b>Maps</b></h3><h4><b>Public Assembly</b> - Taken from story Chapter 1-2.</h4><p style=""><strong>Enemies:</strong></p><ul><li>Village Majini</li><li>Instigator Majini</li><li>Executioner Majini (Miniboss)</li></ul><h4><b>The Mines</b> - Taken from story Chapter 2-2.</h4><p style=""><strong>Enemies:</strong></p><ul><li>Village Majini</li><li>Big Man Majini</li><li>Reaper (Miniboss)</li></ul><h4><b>Village</b> - Taken from story Chapter 3-2.</h4><p style=""><strong>Enemies:</strong></p><ul><li>Wetlands Majini</li><li>Bui Kichwa</li><li>Giant Majini (Miniboss)</li></ul><h4><b>Ancient Ruins</b> - Taken from story Chapter 4-1</h4><p style=""><strong>Enemies:</strong></p><ul><li>Wetlands Majini</li><li>Giant Majini (Miniboss)</li></ul><h4><b>Experimental Facility</b> - Taken from story Chapter 5-2</h4><p style=""><strong>Enemies:</strong></p><ul><li>Soldier Majini</li><li>Licker β</li></ul><h4><b>Missile Area</b> - Taken from story Chapter 6-2</h4><p style=""><strong>Enemies:</strong></p><ul><li>Soldier Majini</li><li>Gatling Gun Majini (Miniboss)</li></ul><h4><b>Ship Deck</b> - Taken from story Chapter 6-1</h4><p style=""><strong>Enemies:</strong></p><ul><li>Villager Majini</li><li>Chainsaw Majini (Miniboss)</li></ul><h4><b>Prison -</b> An all new environment built specifically for the Mercenaries mode.</h4><p style=""><strong>Enemies:</strong></p><ul><li>Villager Majini</li><li>Big Man Majini</li><li>Executioner Majini</li></ul><h2><a href="/downloadable-content/3015-329/" data-ref-id="3015-329"><b>Downloadable Content</b></a></h2><h3>Versus</h3><p style="">The Versus pack was released soon after the game's initial launch. It features two game types: Slayers Mode, which is a "point-based game that challenges players to kill Majinis," while Survivors Mode is the game's take on deathmatch. 1v1 or 2v2 is available for both game types. The games are essentially the classic Mercenaries modes with team-based gameplay. The Slayers game mode lets players earn points for killing Majinis and other creatures.</p><p style="">The Survivors mode pits players against each other and they earn points for getting kills. While Majinis and other creatures will be present in this mode as well, players do not get points for killing them. <i>Versus</i> is the least popular of the DLC, given that RE5's control scheme does not lend itself well to deathmatch.</p><h3>Lost in Nightmares</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70497/1208606-re5___jill_valentine___chris_redfield_rs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1208606" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.36875" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:136.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70497/1208606-re5___jill_valentine___chris_redfield_rs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1208606"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/7/70497/1208606-re5___jill_valentine___chris_redfield_rs.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/7/70497/1208606-re5___jill_valentine___chris_redfield_rs.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Chris &amp; Jill</figcaption></figure><p style="">The Lost in Nightmares DLC is a 1-2 hour mini-campaign, playable in singleplayer or co-op. While it's generally rather short, the game cannot be saved and must be completed in one go.</p><p style="">Lost in Nightmares follows Chris &amp; Jill during the BSAA mission glimpsed in flashback amidst the main campaign. Set in 2005, three years before Resident Evil 5's story occurs, Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine are to infiltrate a mansion to locate <a href="/ozwell-e-spencer/3005-10018/" data-ref-id="3005-10018">Ozwell E. Spencer</a>, the founder of the sinister Umbrella Corporation. The mini-campaign is deliberately reminiscent of the original <a href="/resident-evil/3030-5842/" data-ref-id="3030-5842">Resident Evil</a>, with innumerable easter eggs and references. These include:</p><ul><li>Jill Valentine having to play moonlight sonata to open a secret passage within a wall.</li><li>Jill also having to lockpick a door.</li><li>An Itchy Tasty reference.</li><li>Cranks.</li><li>A remix of the original Resident Evil Save Room theme that plays over the results screen.</li><li>The ability to play the first third in the mansion with camera angles in place, should the player examine the entrance three times.</li></ul><p style="">Lost in Nightmares focuses heavily on puzzles over combat, with only one type of enemy across the story -- a new creature called the Guardian of Insanity, which is similar to the Executioner from Resident Evil 5's campaign. However, multiple Guardians are encountered throughout; most are scripted to show up, however the very firsts appearance is random.</p><p style="">The player's inventory from the main game cannot be transferred into Lost in Nightmare, and both Chris &amp; Jill will always begin with the same M92F pistols. Other weapons can be acquired within the mansion, although what weapons players will find are randomized. The list of weapons that can be found are but a fraction of what can be attained in the main game, however. A list of potential weapons the player may find is as such:</p><ul><li>M3 Shotgun</li><li>H&amp;K Handgun</li><li>S&amp;W Magnum Revolver</li><li>PSG1 Sniper Rifle</li><li>MP5 SMG</li></ul><p style="">The mini-campaign ultimately concludes with Jill and Chris fighting the ill-fated boss encounter with Wesker depicted in the flashback, which functions exactly like the default Wesker battle from the core game. Wesker can similarly be beaten by either surviving long enough to trigger the cutscene, or by dealing enough damage to end the fight prematurely.</p><p style="">BSAA emblems, similar to the ones found in the main game, are hidden throughout the area and can be shot for points.</p><h3>Desperate Escape</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2636878-resident-evil-5-dlc-desperate-escape1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2636878" data-ratio="0.56315789473684" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2636878-resident-evil-5-dlc-desperate-escape1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2636878"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2636878-resident-evil-5-dlc-desperate-escape1.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2636878-resident-evil-5-dlc-desperate-escape1.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Jill &amp; Josh</figcaption></figure><p style="">The Desperate Escape DLC is another 1-2 hour mini-campaign, this time focusing on the actions of Jill Valentine and Josh Stone immediately after the boss fight against a mind-controlled Jill. Jill and Josh must flee the TriCell Facility while Chris and Sheva pursue Wesker. Unlike Lost in Nightmares, Desperate Escape focuses almost entirely on combat, with players constantly being ambushed by Majini of all varieties as they make their way across all new environments. Though what enemies the player will face during a playthrough is randomized.</p><p style="">Like Lost in Nightmares the player's inventory from the core game cannot be transferred over, and both Jill &amp; Josh begin with a pre-set inventory. Many more weapons and supplies can be procured in the field, though they are once again random. The same listing of weapons that can be found in Lost in Nightmares is the same here, only with the added chance of locating an RPG launcher.</p><p style="">It ends with a last stand, where Jill and Josh must defend themselves until a rescue helicopter comes to save them. This explains how they got their hands on one in time for the main campaign's finale. Like Versus and Lost in Nightmares, Desperate Escape is playable in singleplayer or co-op, splitscreen or online, and costs $5 on Playstation Network or XBox Live Marketplace.</p><p style="">BSAA emblems can once again be found and shot to increase the player's overall score.</p><p style="">The game became available for purchase on February 16, 2010 on the Xbox Live platform Games on Demand for $29.99 USD. All three DLC packs were included in the new Resident Evil 5 Gold Edition.</p><h2>Mercenaries Reunion</h2><p style="">A remix of Resident Evil 5's original Mercenaries minigame, Reunion is first made available should the player purchase the Lost in Nightmares pack or Desperate Escape pack, and is also packed within the Gold Edition of Resident Evil 5. All of the available characters are packed in as well, however should the player only purchase Lost in Nightmares or Desperate Escape, the roster list is cut in half. Because Reunion is a separate mode from the default Mercenaries mode, each set of characters is exclusive to each mode, disallowing the option for having Barry Burton and Albert Wesker team up in 2-player for example.</p><p style="">Because the roles of Josh and Jill have been reversed (Josh now being playable while Jill is not), Jill is the announcer for Mercenaries Reunion.</p><h3><b>Characters - Lost in Nightmare Unlocks</b></h3><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Character</th><th scope="col">Starting Inventory</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Barry Burton (S.T.A.R.S.)</strong></td><td><ul><li>Samurai Edge Handgun w/ 30 Rounds</li><li>S&amp;W M29 Magnum w/ 12 Rounds</li><li>Dragunov Sniper Rifle w/ 18 Rounds</li><li>50 Handgun Bullets</li><li>6 Magnum Bullets</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Excella Gionne (TriCell)</strong></td><td><ul><li>M93R Raffica Pistol w/ 30 Rounds</li><li>AK74 Assault Rifle w/ 50 Rounds</li><li>Grenade Launcher w/ 12 Flash Rounds</li><li>50 Handgun Bullets</li><li>150 Machinegun Bullets</li><li>First Aid Spray</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><p style=""> </p><h3><strong>Characters - Desperate Escape Unlocks</strong></h3><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Character</th><th scope="col">Starting Inventory</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Rebecca Chambers (S.T.A.R.S.)</strong></td><td><ul><li>H&amp;K MP5 Submachine Gun w/ 120 Rounds</li><li>Jail Breaker Shotgun w/ 10 Rounds</li><li>150 Machinegun Bullets</li><li>150 Machinegun Bullets</li><li>30 Shotgun Shells</li><li>30 Shotgun Shells</li><li>First Aid Spray</li><li>First Aid Spray</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Josh Stone (B.S.A.A.)</strong></td><td><ul><li>M92F Handgun w/ 100 Rounds</li><li>M3 Shotgun w/ 7 Rounds</li><li>RPG Launcher</li><li>3 Hand Grenades</li><li>10 Handgun Bullets</li><li>10 Shotgun Shells</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><p style=""> </p><h3>Characters - Costume DLC Unlocks</h3><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Character</th><th scope="col">Starting Inventory</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Chris Redfield (Warrior)</strong></td><td><ul><li>H&amp;K P8 Handgun w/ 25 Rounds</li><li>Hydra Shotgun w/ 10 Rounds</li><li>H&amp;K PSG1 Sniper Rifle w/ 15 Rounds</li><li>30 Handgun Bullets</li><li>15 Shotgun Shells</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Chris Redfield (Heavy Metal)</strong></td><td><ul><li>Gatling Gun w/ Infinite Ammo</li><li>Cattle Prod</li><li>3 Proximity Mines</li><li>3 Hand Grenades</li><li>Melee Vest</li><li>Bulletproof Vest</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sheva Alomar (Fairy Tale)</strong></td><td><ul><li>SIG 556 Assault Rifle w/ 80 Rounds</li><li>Ithaca M37 Shotgun w/ 25 Rounds</li><li>S&amp;W M500 Magnum w/ 6 Rounds</li><li>100 Machinegun Bullets</li><li>10 Shotgun Shells</li><li>6 Magnum Bullets</li><li>5 Golden Eggs</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sheva Alomar (Business Lady)</strong></td><td><ul><li>SIG P226 Handgun w/ 16 Rounds</li><li>Lightning Hawk Magnum w/ 8 Rounds</li><li>5 Proximity Mines</li><li>50 Handgun Bullets</li><li>12 Magnum Bullets</li><li>First Aid Spray</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><p style=""> </p><h3>Maps</h3><p style="">Reunion features all of the same maps from the original mode.

It was initially developed to be a single-player game like Resident Evil 4 before it and zombies were once again the primary opponents the player would face. Other such revisions include Jill Valentine being Chris' Partner instead of Sheva Alomar. Furthermore, even when planned as a single-player game, Jill would still appear in the game and could in fact permanently die during the story based upon a player choice. Sheva was always planned to star in the game one way or the other, only she was originally depicted as a member of a guerilla group instead of the BSAA.</p><p style="">Excella Gionne was to initially be featured in the game as a TriCell secretary as opposed to being the head of its West African division. What is now known as her role in RE5 was to be filled in by a male ''CEO type character'', to whom she and Wesker would betray, though only before Wesker would also ultimately betray Excella.</p><p style="">One notable mechanic that was removed mid-development was that of heat disorientation. Should the player have been wandering around out in the sun for too long, their character would start to become disorientated and would even begin to hallucinate. Players would then have to find some shade to take cover from the beating down sun and recuperate.</p><h3>Racism Controversy</h3><p style="">After the first full gameplay trailer was released during 2007's E3, many interpreted the trailer depicting a lone white character (Chris Redfield) killing infected colored African Majini as to feature racist overtones. However the next trailer then showcased more common Majini varieties besides those of a dark complexion, including Caucasian and some that even look vaguely Spanish. Sheva Alomar, a West African native, was also confirmed to star as Chris' partner during the very same trailer.</p><p style="">Resident Evil 5 producer <a href="/masachika-kawata/3040-32929/" data-ref-id="3040-32929">Masachika Kawata</a> stated in response to the criticisms "We can't please everyone. We're in the entertainment business – we're not here to state our political opinion or anything like that. It's unfortunate that some people felt that way." Lead producer <a href="/jun-takeuchi/3040-41365/" data-ref-id="3040-41365">Jun Takeuchi </a>also expressed surprise at the complaints, and refuted any claims that the game was altered in any way as a reaction to the accusations.</p><h3>Demo</h3><p style="">On Friday, December 5th, 2008 a demo for the game was put on <a href="/xbox-live-marketplace/3045-86/" data-ref-id="3045-86">XBLA</a> for Japan. Included in the demo are two stages, Shanty Town and District, which can be played either on solo, or via offline or online Co-op play, which is a highlighted new feature in Resident Evil 5. With some clever snooping on the Internet, one would have been able to acquire the demo for the 360 version of the game. For those who patiently waited, the 360 demo was released on January 26 via the Xbox Live Marketplace being exclusive to Gold Xbox Live members for a week. It was released on PS3 via the Playstation Store a week later on February 2nd.</p><h2>Trivia</h2><ul><li>Jill coincidentally bears a somewhat close resemblance to <a href="/fiona/3005-2146/" data-ref-id="3005-2146">Fiona</a>, the protagonist of the Capcom game <a href="/haunting-ground/3030-2842/" data-ref-id="3030-2842">Haunting Ground</a>.</li><li>Sheva is the first left-handed playable character in the Resident Evil franchise, and the camera is positioned over her left shoulder to compensate; in addition, her HUD is horizontally flipped from the other characters'. The reason for this is to create a more pleasing visual when playing the game in co-op split-screen mode.</li><li>Chris Redfield's voice actor in RE5, <a href="/roger-smith/3040-4136/" data-ref-id="3040-4136">Roger Craig Smith</a>, also voiced antagonist Curtis Miller from the straight-to-DVD RE feature flick <i><a href="/tang-resident-evil-degeneration/2300-319/" data-ref-id="2300-319">Resident Evil: Degeneration</a>.</i></li><li>During Chapter 1-1, should players let Chris &amp; Sheva go idle for a few minutes, this will then trigger a secret conversation between the two where they talk about elements of North American culture.</li><li>During development, the Uroboros creature was nicknamed 'Wriggles' by the staff.</li></ul><h2>Soundtrack</h2><figure

Like other Civilization games, players choose a historical figure such as Lincoln, Cleopatra, Stalin, Bonaparte and Catherine the Great to lead their civilization. With a scaled progression of time, your small village becomes a bustling metropolis as it moves through the ages. You may, with the advice of animated advisers that pop up throughout the game, decide to keep peace with other societies. On the other hand, you may decide to squash those poor, uncivilized tribes with an example of advanced firepower. The choice is up to you, though interactions with other leaders will be shaped with that character's historically-noted personality.</p><p style="">As with all Civilization games, power is not the only route to victory. You are allowed to play in a number of different styles, each of which can lead to winning a match.</p><ul><li>Domination: You must capture and hold each of the other 4 civilizations' capital cities.</li><li>Technology: Be the first to launch a space ship and discovery the planet Alpha Centauri.</li><li>Cultural: Acquire 20 Great Persons, wonders, and/or captured cities and build the United Nations wonder.</li><li>Economic: Amass 20,000 gold and build the World Bank wonder.</li></ul><p style="">Other single player modes include Game of the Week and Scenario. Game of the Week is a weekly match in which players compete asynchronously over the Internet. The map, starting location and competing civilizations are the same for everyone. The best scores are posted online, broken down by difficulty, to show you how you stack up against players around the world. To prevent cheating, the save option is disabled in this mode.</p><p style="">Scenarios are unique matches that add their own win conditions and rules.</p><h2>Multiplayer</h2><p style="">In addition to the single-player mode, the game also has online support on consoles. This allows up to four human players and one AI player to compete in multiple modes of ranked or unranked matches.</p><ul><li>Head-to-Head: Two human players face off against each other and 3 AI controlled civilizations.</li><li>Teams: Two teams of two humans and one AI civilization fight for supremacy.</li><li>Free-for-all: Four human players and one AI in an all out brawl to become the best civilization.</li></ul><h2>Civilizations</h2><p style="">There are sixteen civilizations in the game, each has unique attributes that they gain at the beginning of each era. Some civilizations have unique units as well.</p><h3>The Romans</h3><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4053/410264-roman.jpg"

open neighborhood, and a greater focus on character development.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style=""><i>The Sims 3</i>, the third base game in the Sims franchise, allows players to explore a seamless, open neighborhood, visit neighbors’ homes, and create realistic Sims with distinctive personalities. Your Sims can roam outside of their home with no loading times. They can stroll downtown to hang out with friends, meet someone new at the park, or run into colleagues on the street. New community buildings are available to let your Sim run wild, socialize, work, and play. Easy-to-use design tools allow for unlimited customization to make truly individual Sims. Determine your Sims’ shape and size, from thin to full-figured to muscular—and everything in between. <i>The Sims 3</i> offers much more in the way of customizing the Sims that live in the neighborhood and also the buildings and places. Thanks to the new smarter AI, Sims will know when to do chores, activities, socializing and how long they should do them for.</p><h2>Sunset Valley</h2><p style=""><i>The Sims 3</i> neighborhood is now completely seamless. There are no longer multiple neighborhoods such as Downtown, Vacation, and so on. Load times when moving around the neighborhood has been eliminated so the whole town can be explored including Neighbors, Shops and Recreation without a hitch. There are close to 90 houses in the town, each with its own family. At release, the game includes one neighborhood, but the developers have released a tool to add more neighborhoods.</p><h3>Neighborhood Features</h3><ul><li>Everyone in the town will age together.</li><li>Trees and shrubs sway in the breeze.</li><li>The town is fully customizable and allows you to remove and change lots and Sims.</li><li>"Map Tags" float over areas to allow a quick way to find your way around.</li><li>Sims can move nearer to their place of work to reduce traveling time.</li><li>Land values are not just based on size, but now include location.</li><li>You are able to zoom out to see the entire neighborhood or zoom in to a see a single Sim.</li><li>Move houses to bigger or smaller lot sizes.</li></ul><h2>Sims</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5207/226614-s3_cas_socialite_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-226614" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5207/226614-s3_cas_socialite_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-226614"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5207/226614-s3_cas_socialite_1.jpg"></a><figcaption>An example of a Sim.  </figcaption></figure><p style="">The Sims themselves have been completely changed from previous games. Now you are able to create realistic Sims with distinctive personalities. Select from dozens of personality traits and combine them in fun ways. The combination of traits you choose help shape the behavior of your Sims and how they interact with other Sims. Your Sims now have a very basic set of every day needs and they are more complex individuals with unique personalities. There will no longer be "happy" or "sad", or even "furious," Sims now have a new range of Emotions which they will follow, allowing them to express themselves even more. The concept of a mood bar in the game has been replaced with a set of icons called moodlets that show how your Sims feel. Moodlets will stay with your Sim and the duration will be set by a number of factors, including severity and Sims' disposition. Special moods such as embarrassed or depressed are all part of the moodlets system.</p><p style="">Sims now have dreams and traits. Dreams are desires of your Sim that can include wanting to talk to another Sim, get a new career, have a baby and much more. You can decide then to turn it into a Promise. Ignoring a Dream is okay, but ignoring a Promise gives you negative repercussions. There will be around 80 different types of traits to choose from and each Sim will have a total of 5 once they reach the young adult life stage. These Traits will affect how a Sim behaves towards others and affects their moods, like the mood of a Sim that enjoys the outdoors will rise when he/she is outside. There will be 7 age groups: Baby, Toddler, Child, Teenager, Young Adult, Adult, and Elder. Every career has its own building in the neighborhood. Advancing in a career is changed as it depends on skills, personality, relationship with colleagues/boss and even certain goals that have to be fulfilled. Sims can take part-time jobs. Besides the newspaper, you can also apply for a job at the specific career building.</p><p style="">The job system has also received an overhaul. Rather than the Sims simply disappearing for a few hours before coming home, they will actually physically go to a building in the city to work. For example, if a Sim is a musician, they will travel to the theater for work. While they are working, players are able dictate how they work, with options ranging from "Take It Easy" to "Work Hard" (which tires them out and causes stress but gets more stuff done). Jobs can also have specific options, such as the musician career path having the option to chill with your band mates or study music theory.</p><h3>Keeping Sims Fulfilled</h3><p style="">Once you created your Sims on PS3, DS, Wii, XBOX 360, PC or Mac, you can either make Sims happy (Fulfilled) or Unhappy (Unfulfilled). Although you earn more experience if they are fulfilled in even the simplest way. To Do: just look at your Sim's needs and dreams and complete them.</p><h3>Sims Features</h3><ul><li>There are only 6 needs: Energy, Bladder, Fun, Hunger, Social, Hygiene.</li><li>Sims have certain skills like cooking or fishing.</li><li>Hair will not grow but you can 'paint' certain parts of the hair.</li><li>They will look after themselves better.</li><li>Instead of fixed interaction (like Talk or Joke), the options are filtered based on your current Mood or your Traits.</li><li>Sims still spin around to change clothes.</li><li>Sims have likes and dislikes to certain foods, colors, music and much more.</li><li>Sims will now focus on many new skills, skills will not be static as in The Sims 2.</li></ul><h2>Customization</h2><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4371/282003-image002_noscale.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-282003" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.58246656760773" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:58.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4371/282003-image002_noscale.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-282003"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4371/282003-image002_noscale.jpg"></a><figcaption>Add patterns and colors to almost everything in the game</figcaption></figure><p style="">The Sims and the neighborhood are more customizable than ever before and new and improved tools will be provided to help you create everything you want. Build your dream house or design the ultimate home. Customize everything from floors to flowers, shirts to sofas, wallpaper to window shades. It’s fun and easy to change colors and patterns giving you endless personalization options. You can also populate your Sims’ neighborhood with pre-designed buildings and furnishings. Create-A-Sim has also been vastly improved and will allow you to really make the sims you create unique. There are now sliders for weight and fitness. Sims that you created fat can become thin by exercising, and thin created people get fat by eating a lot. Sims no longer have to have shoes that are fixed to the outfit, as with <i>The Sims 2.</i> These are now separate and can be chosen individually. You can choose a Sims' favorite color, music type, food, etc. One of the most exciting features is now the ability to change voice and even pitch, so your Sim can sound unique and will be recognizable by just listening to them talk.</p><p style="">Another great addition to the build tools is the ability to move objects 360 degrees and without a grid. You can now also position stuff on counters or desktops as long as the objects aren't overlapping. There will be a grid available if you need help placing objects, but it will be much smaller. You will be able to center a 3 tile couch to a 2 tile TV set.</p><h3>Customization Features</h3><ul><li>You can choose specific Asian and African models.</li><li>Shoes are separate and you can also choose barefoot or wear socks.</li><li>Body can be shaped just like the faces are able to.</li><li>Adult now considered more 'middle aged' and includes wrinkles.</li><li>Use your own patterns/colors and then apply it to anything through a drag-and-drop interface.</li><li>Buy an empty bookcase and then buy and place books in it.</li><li>Table and chairs link and can move as 1 object (same with beds and end tables).</li><li>You can make a certain stair wider (up to 4 tiles wide) with a slider.</li><li>You are able to build 5 stories high.</li><li>You can pick up items (garbage, books,etc.) yourself with a Hand cursor.</li></ul><h2>The Sims 3 Online Store</h2><p style="">EA (Electronic Arts) have created a new unique "The Sims 3 Store" where you can shop online for interesting items for the game. The items on The Store are much different to regular items found in Build/Buy Mode (In Gameplay). Purchasing the items, you will be paying by Sim Points, exclusive to the Store. However, some items are Free of Charge such as, Registration Rewards. When you Register The Sims 3, you will be given 1000 Sim Points to freely spend, but on other Expansion Packs you will receive rewards (Exclusive Registration Items)...</p><p style="">Visit <a href="http://store.thesims3.com/" rel="nofollow">The Sims 3 Store</a></p><h3>The Exchange</h3><p style="">The Exchange can be found on the console versions of the Sims 3.

For instance if you want to improve the cooking skills some of your options are watching a tv show about cooking, reading a cookbook, and actually practicing making meals. All of these skills will eventually rise if the Sim continually works on them and a scale from 1 to 10 represents where they currently fall within that skill. When a skill is complete, it will be highlighted green and considered 'mastered' in the Skill journal.</p><h2>Cheat Codes</h2><p style="">The Sims franchise is notorious for including a bounty of cheat codes, and The Sims 3 is no different. The game includes many cheat codes that modify the game in some truly bizarre ways. Note that these codes should be used your own risk, some may harm game performance or stability. To enter the codes, press the Control and C keys at the same time. Then enter the code desired.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Cheat Code Name</th><th>Result</th><th>Game Required</th></tr><tr><td>Kaching</td><td>Adds §1,000 to the household's funds</td><td>Sims 3</td></tr><tr><td>Motherlode</td><td>Adds §50,000 to the household's funds</td><td>Sims 3</td></tr><tr><td>constrainFloorElevation (true/false)</td><td>Choosing "false" makes it possible to raise or lower the floor even when objects are in the way</td><td>Sims 3</td></tr><tr><td>testingCheatsEnabled (true/false)</td><td>Enables debug cheats</td><td>Sims 3</td></tr><tr><td>FreeRealEstate</td><td>Free Lots to buy</td><td>Sims 3</td></tr><tr><td>hideHeadlineEffects (on/off)</td><td>Hides or shows thought bubbles and plumbobs.

Challenges can be broken down into 3 distinct categories: Life, Feats, and Collection. Life challenges are simple and usually require the Sim just to do one thing to complete it. An example of a life challenge is to start a painting or take a bubble bath. The Feats Challenges usually require more time and are longevity based. An example of a Feats challenge would be like that of improving a skill to level ten or watching TV for ten hours. The collection challenges require the Sim to complete all tasks in a set of items. These can range from reading all the books to catching all of the perfect fish in the game.</p><p style="">For every challenge you complete, you gain points that can be used to buy things at the collection shop. The collection shop contains many varying sorts of items including clothes, furniture, and some of the karma powers are unlocked in the collection shop. The challenges are tied to one account so every time you create a new Sim household you will have all of your challenge points available to use.</p><h2>System Requirements</h2><h3>PC Desktop<b><br /></b></h3><h4>XP (Service Pack 2)</h4><ul><li>Processor: Pentium IV 2.0 GHz / Athlon XP 2000</li><li>Memory: 1 GB</li><li>Graphics: GeForce FX 5900 / Radeon 9500</li><li>Graphics Ram: 128 MB</li></ul><h4>Vista (Service Pack 1)</h4><ul><li>Processor:Pentium IV 2.4 GHz / Athlon XP 2400</li><li>Memory: 1.5 GB</li><li>Graphics: GeForce FX 5900 / Radeon 9500</li><li>Graphics Ram: 128 MB</li></ul><h3>Laptop</h3><h4>XP (Service Pack 2)</h4><ul><li>Processor: Pentium IV 2.4 GHz / Athlon XP 2400</li><li>Memory: 1.5 GB</li><li>Graphics: GeForce Go 6200 / Radeon mobile 9600</li><li>Graphics Ram: 128 MB</li></ul><h4>Vista (Service Pack 1)</h4><ul><li>Processor: Pentium IV 2.4 GHz / Athlon XP 2400</li><li>Memory: 2.0 GB</li><li>Graphics: GeForce Go 6200 / Radeon mobile 9600</li><li>Graphics Ram: 128 MB</li></ul><h3>Mac OS X</h3><ul><li>OS: Mac OS X 10.5.7 Leopard or Higher</li><li>Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo</li><li>Memory: 2.0 GB</li><li>HDD: 6.1 GB of hard disk space, with at least 1 GB additional space for saved games and custom content.</li><li>Video: ATI X1600 or Nvidia 7300 GT with 128 MB of RAM or Intel Integrated GMA X3100</li><li>Supported Video Cards: ATI Radeon ™ X1600, X1900, 2400, 2600, 3870, 4850, 4870, NVIDIA GeForce 7300, 7600, 8600, 8800, 9400M, 9600M GT, GT 120, GT 130, Intel ® Graphics Media Accelerator (GMA) GMA 3-Series .

The Create-A-World tool (more frequently called CAW) can be used by players to create entirely new towns to explore, and these towns can be shared on the Sims 3 website. The second tool is the Create-A-Pattern tool (known as CAP) where players can make their own patterns that can be used on furnishings or clothing in the game. Both of these tools are fully supported by EA and are regularly updated along with the game itself.</p><h2>Xbox 360, PS3, DS, 3DS, and Wii releases</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5785/1354014-580ts3consolecoupleretreat.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1354014" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.56206896551724" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5785/1354014-580ts3consolecoupleretreat.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1354014"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5785/1354014-580ts3consolecoupleretreat.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5785/1354014-580ts3consolecoupleretreat.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Sims franchise has already generated $2.5 billion in revenue.</figcaption></figure><p style="">EA lived up to last year's promise after releasing Sim's 3 for the PC and has officially announced the development of Sim 3 for consoles and handhelds this holiday season. The console versions will have several new features such as "Karma Power" which determines whether your Sim can get lucky in certain tasks or ultimately fail. The PS3 and 360 versions will feature Facebook connectivity to enable the sharing of achievements and trophies via wall posts, and the Wii version will get it's own beach town. The DS will introduce a brand new story mode, not seen previously in handheld Sims games. A 3DS version was also released, this version was similar to the iOS release with added 3D effects. The Sims 3 Pets was also released on The Xbox 360, Playstation 3 and Nintendo 3DS. The Xbox 360 version added Kinect support to the franchise.</p><h2>Karma Powers</h2><p style="">Accumulating Karma in the Sims 3 can be done in two ways. Firstly, Karma is gained by completing the wishes your Sims desire. At midnight, Karma is also dispersed upon your Sims and the amount given is directly effected to whether or not the Sim used one of their Karma Powers earlier in the day. Karma Powers can be placed into two shades of categories: light(good) and dark(bad). Some of the powers are locked from the start and must be unlocked in the challenge shop.</p><p style="">The following good Karma Powers are as follows:</p><ul><li><b>Instant Beauty</b>: Give any Sim in your household an instant makeover by taking him or her back to create a Sim!</li><li><b>Good Times</b>: Remove bad moodlets from everyone at the same time to put all your sims in a better mood!</li><li><b>Bless the Mess</b>: Instantly repair and clean anything broken, dirty, or messy!</li><li><b>Super Satisfy</b>: Satisfy any Sim by maximizing all of his or her needs at once!</li><li><b>Stroke of Genius</b>: Make any Sim learn skills at a supper-accelerated rate for a few hours!</li><li><b>Get Lucky</b>: Make any Sim super lucky in love, at work, at finding rare items and even catching fish!</li><li><b>Giant Jackpot</b>: Let any Sim hit the jackpot with free money from the heavens! Drop anywhere from 1000 Simoleans to 15 thousand Simoleans instantly!</li><li><b>Divine Intervention</b>: Bring any dead family member back to life! Use on their ghost.</li></ul><p style="">The five bad karma powers are listed as follows:</p><ul><li><b>Cosmic Curse</b>: Lower any Sim's need to rock bottom instantly!</li><li><b>Fire Storm</b>: Rain fire and brimstone down on the world with a flaming meteorite shower!</li><li><b>Quake Maker</b>: Shake the world and watch things break and burn!</li><li><b>Poltergeists</b>: Haunt any house with these angry ghosts to scare the living daylights out of your Sims!</li><li><b>Epic Fail</b>: Make any Sim an epic failure in love, career, and even simple household tasks for a few hours!</li></ul><p style="">The Karma Powers 'Get Lucky', 'Giant Jackpot', 'Good Times', 'Stroke of Genius', 'Divine Intervention', and 'Fire Storm' must be unlocked before use.</p><h2>Achievements (PC)</h2><p style="">Prior to the release of The Sims 3's expansion pack <a href="/the-sims-3-showtime/3030-37006/" data-ref-id="3030-37006">Showtime</a>, the base game was updated to include achievements, in addition to Showtime's.

src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/270/374120-929717_20060804_screen026.jpg"></a><figcaption>A new beginning.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Sonic's first title for the <a href="/xbox-360/3045-20/" data-ref-id="3045-20">Xbox 360</a> and <a href="/playstation-3/3045-35/" data-ref-id="3045-35">Playstation 3 </a>was supposed to be a new beginning for the franchise. Originally billed as a reboot for the series, the primary design goal for the game was to create a "realistic" Sonic game -- complete with a full-on <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/daynight-cycle/3015-92/" data-ref-id="3015-92">day/night cycle</a>, physics-centric gameplay, and a huge world to explore. The game that ended up on store shelves was radically different: essentially another game broken out of the <a href="/sonic-adventure/3030-7852/" data-ref-id="3030-7852">Sonic Adventure</a> gameplay mold, it contained unaltered game elements and concepts largely dating all the way back to 1999.</p><p style="">As per the formula established by Sonic Adventure, Sonic the Hedgehog (2006) is broken up in to multiple storylines: one for hero <a href="/sonic-the-hedgehog/3005-73/" data-ref-id="3005-73">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>, another for rival <a href="/shadow-the-hedgehog/3005-811/" data-ref-id="3005-811">Shadow the Hedgehog</a>, and a third story for the newcomer <a href="/silver-the-hedgehog/3005-1969/" data-ref-id="3005-1969">Silver the Hedgehog</a>. Though each character has their own plot threads, paths frequently cross and storylines intersect. Like <a href="/sonic-adventure-2/3030-19060/" data-ref-id="3030-19060">Sonic Adventure 2</a>, each of the three characters' campaigns does not represent just a single playable character, but a team of characters. For example, throughout the course of Sonic's story, one can expect to play portions of certain stages as <a href="/tails/3005-45/" data-ref-id="3005-45">Tails</a>, or <a href="/knuckles/3005-204/" data-ref-id="3005-204">Knuckles</a>. Likewise, players who choose Silver will at times be required to play as <a href="/blaze-the-cat/3005-2200/" data-ref-id="3005-2200">Blaze the Cat</a> and <a href="/amy-rose/3005-948/" data-ref-id="3005-948">Amy Rose</a>, and lastly, Shadow teams up with <a href="/rouge-the-bat/3005-2366/" data-ref-id="3005-2366">Rouge the Bat</a> and <a href="/e-123-omega/3005-4068/" data-ref-id="3005-4068">E-123 Omega</a> from <a href="/sonic-heroes/3030-9523/" data-ref-id="3030-9523">Sonic Heroes</a>. Each character has abilities unique to them and can differ greatly from Sonic in terms of play style.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12968/342686-scsh300223.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-342686" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.56338028169014" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12968/342686-scsh300223.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-342686"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/12968/342686-scsh300223.jpg"></a></figure><p style="">The game is broken up in to two major modes: free-roaming "Town Stages" and more goal-oriented "Action Stages". A typical scenario involves exploring a Town Stage in order to find a way to access the next Action Stage, and once the level is complete, you're taken back to the Town Stage to repeat the process. Town Stages contain human <a href="/non-player-character/3015-967/" data-ref-id="3015-967">NPCs</a>, which can offer hints on how to find the next Action Stage, or offer side missions to complete for money. A handful of shops exist around the game world's as well, which will sell upgrades that unlock new abilities.</p><p style="">New to the game is the "Action Gauge": a meter that determines how much of a special ability each character can use. When the gauge depletes, the special ability is unavailable until it recharges. For example, Silver the Hedgehog can only use his psychokinesis until the action gauge is empty.</p><p style="">Although Sonic's action gauge is always on-screen (just as it is for other characters) he possesses no abilities that deplete the action gauge - except for when he is carrying <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/princess-elise/3005-15639/" data-ref-id="3005-15639">Princess Elise</a>, where it's used for a protective shield ability.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5892/219280-sonic_the_hedgehog_ps3screenshots2769sonic_movie03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-219280" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5892/219280-sonic_the_hedgehog_ps3screenshots2769sonic_movie03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-219280"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5892/219280-sonic_the_hedgehog_ps3screenshots2769sonic_movie03.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5892/219280-sonic_the_hedgehog_ps3screenshots2769sonic_movie03.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">In Soleanna, the City of Water, its people are holding a celebration marked by the lighting of a giant torch called the "Sun of Soleanna". During a fireworks display right at the ceremony's crescendo, Doctor Eggman launches a missile attack on the celebration, and uses the ensuing commotion to swoop down and attempt to kidnap the only surviving member of royalty: <a href="../../princess-elise/94-15639/" rel="nofollow">Princess Elise</a>. Eggman knows that contained inside of Princess Elise is a dark power known as "The Flames of Disaster", and he wants to use this power combined with the energy of the Chaos Emeralds to fuel "Solaris", a time machine of his own invention. With time travel firmly in his grasp, nothing would be able to stop Eggman from ruling the world.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/32127/2182517-sonic_carrying_hooman.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2182517" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/32127/2182517-sonic_carrying_hooman.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2182517"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Right on cue, Sonic the Hedgehog shows up to rescue the Princess. Unfortunately, a second ambush catches Sonic off guard, and he ultimately loses the Princess to the Doctor.</p><p style="">Watching this spectacle from the shadows is Silver the Hedgehog, who was sent from the future to kill Sonic, believing him to be the "Iblis Trigger". In the future, the world is in ruins caused by a destructive, sentient flame called "Iblis". Silver was brought to the past by a mysterious being called "<a href="/mephiles-the-dark/3005-6830/" data-ref-id="3005-6830">Mephiles</a>" who has the power to travel through time. Mephiles informed Silver that it was Sonic who unleashed Iblis and is therefore the one responsible for destroying the world. If Sonic is killed in the past, Iblis will never be unleashed, and the future will be saved.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5892/219306-sonic_the_hedgehog_ps3screenshots2770sonic_movie04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-219306" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5892/219306-sonic_the_hedgehog_ps3screenshots2770sonic_movie04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-219306"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5892/219306-sonic_the_hedgehog_ps3screenshots2770sonic_movie04.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5892/219306-sonic_the_hedgehog_ps3screenshots2770sonic_movie04.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Silver the Hedgehog.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Unknown to Silver, Mephiles is actually an evil entity who was supposed to be sealed inside the Scepter of Darkness centuries before Silver's time.

Much to Shadow's confusion, Mephiles somehow seems to know who Shadow is, as if they had a previous encounter - though this was Shadow's first meeting with Mephiles. After being freed, Mephiles banishes both Shadow and Rouge to the dystopian future from where Silver originates.</p><p style="">Now Sonic must save Elise, Silver must kill Sonic, and Shadow has to figure out a way back to his own time!</p><h2>Action Stages</h2><ul><li>Wave Ocean *</li><li>Dusty Desert *</li><li>White Acropolis *</li><li>Crisis City</li><li>Flame Core</li><li>Radical Train</li><li>Tropical Jungle</li><li>Kingdom Valley *</li><li>Aquatic Base *</li><li>End of the World</li></ul><p style="">* Available in Multiplayer.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p style="">Sonic the Hedgehog's soundtrack was composed by <a href="/mariko-nanba/3040-91807/" data-ref-id="3040-91807">Mariko Nanba</a>, <a href="/tomoya-ohtani/3040-40721/" data-ref-id="3040-40721">Tomoya Ohtani</a>, Hideaki Kobayashi, Tai-Hey, and <a href="/jun-senoue/3040-38321/" data-ref-id="3040-38321">Jun Senoue</a>, and was overseen by <a href="/masato-nakamura/3040-16805/" data-ref-id="3040-16805">Masato Nakamura</a>, the original composer for the Sega Genesis games <a href="/sonic-the-hedgehog/3030-2465/" data-ref-id="3030-2465">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> and <a href="/sonic-the-hedgehog-2/3030-1662/" data-ref-id="3030-1662">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a>.

Shown along side a number of other <a href="/tech-demo/3015-2305/" data-ref-id="3015-2305">tech demos </a>Sega created for Microsoft's Xbox 360 console, the "Hedgehog" tech demo featured a real-time animated scene of Sonic racing through miles of forest as robots closed in around him. After easily outrunning the robots, Sonic found himself at the ruins of an old castle, where the demonstrator took control to showcase a real-time physics engine. By pressing a button, the demonstrator would throw out a container which would burst on impact, scattering golden rings around the dilapidated environment. The animation resumed, with Sonic being chased out of the castle by the squad of robots who had been hunting him. Now outside, an airship loomed overhead. The ship's cargo doors opened, and hundreds of hunter robots poured out, completely surrounding Sonic on all sides. Having nowhere to escape to, the robots all simultaneously open fire on the blue hedgehog, and the hail of gunfire presumably leaves Sonic for dead. However, from the smoke rose the now-transformed Super Sonic. Super Sonic flies forward at high speed to meet the robot army head on - the tech demo animation ending right before we see the final result.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1486/752462-929717_20050908_screen003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-752462" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1486/752462-929717_20050908_screen003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-752462"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1486/752462-929717_20050908_screen003.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1486/752462-929717_20050908_screen003.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Despite being played exclusively for the press in secret, cell phone video footage of the tech demo reel was leaked on to the internet within hours of being shown. The game was officially announced on September 9th, 2005 <a href="/sonic-team/3010-781/" data-ref-id="3010-781">by current President of Sonic Team,</a> <a href="../../yuji-naka/72-33662/" rel="nofollow">Yuji Naka</a>, who stated that they would be treating this game as if it were the original <a href="/sonic-the-hedgehog/3030-2465/" data-ref-id="3030-2465">Sonic the Hedgehog </a>on the Sega Genesis - fully committing themselves to rebooting Sonic's universe. The game was to be a new beginning for the franchise, with particular focus being paid to a specific goal: "What if Sonic the Hedgehog existed in the real world?" When officially announced, the same animated scene from the behind-closed-doors demonstration was shown, minus the interactive ring physics demo. Instead, a brief demonstration of the actual game itself was revealed, showing a very early version of the level known as "Kingdom Valley". The highlight of the gameplay demonstration was the game's lighting engine, which self-shadowed everything in the environment. This was to fuel the game's day/night cycle , a first for a Sonic title. All of this would be aimed to celebrate Sonic's 15th Anniversary in 2006.</p><p style="">Not long after that point, Yuji Naka announced his resignation from both Sonic Team and Sega, departing the company after nearly two decades of employment, in order to start an independent studio, <a href="/prope-ltd/3010-6481/" data-ref-id="3010-6481">PROPE</a>. Meanwhile, Nintendo chose Sonic Team as one of the very first third party developers to get <a href="/wii/3045-36/" data-ref-id="3045-36">Wii</a> Development kits - then still codenamed the "Nintendo Revolution". Previously, Sega had planned to release Sonic 2006 on all three platforms, expecting the "Revolution" to be comparable to the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 in terms of technology. When shown the Wii Remote and the level of graphical horsepower in the Wii, Sonic 2006 Game Director <a href="/yojiro-ogawa/3040-40732/" data-ref-id="3040-40732">Yojiro Ogawa </a>decided they would have to make a completely new Sonic game to specifically fit the Wii hardware. To accomplish this task, he split the Sonic 2006 development team, taking half with him to go create <a href="/sonic-and-the-secret-rings/3030-2512/" data-ref-id="3030-2512">Sonic &amp; the Secret Rings </a>for Nintendo's platform. Now working at half-capacity on an ambitious game for unfamiliar next-generation hardware, Sonic Team struggled towards Sonic 2006's impending Holiday season deadline, and was reportedly so behind schedule that many Quality Assurance Tester bug reports had to be ignored in order to get the game out on time.</p><h2>Trivia</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1486/791564-sonic_arch02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-791564" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1486/791564-sonic_arch02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-791564"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1486/791564-sonic_arch02.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1486/791564-sonic_arch02.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Kingdom Valley with the scrapped day/night cycle.</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Despite being a focal point of the original gameplay demonstration, the game's day/night cycle was removed shortly after the game was unveiled.</li><li>A number of online multiplayer modes were at one point planned; Time Trial, Ring Race, and most cryptically, "Quiz".

At one point, extra <a href="/1-up/3055-77/" data-ref-id="3055-77">1ups</a> could also be purchased from shops.</li><li>Perhaps the biggest content cut came in the form of extra missions for each playable character in the game - Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Silver, Amy, Blaze, Shadow, Omega, and Rouge. However, listed among these names was a heretofore unseen secret tenth playable character: <a href="/metal-sonic/3005-2273/" data-ref-id="3005-2273">Metal Sonic</a>, Sonic's long-time robotic doppelganger which originally debuted in <a href="/sonic-cd/3030-14433/" data-ref-id="3030-14433">Sonic CD</a>. Curiously, Metal Sonic is not referenced anywhere else in the game, and no data for him exists anywhere else on the disc - he is only referenced in this on-disc DLC listing.</li><li>In addition, the game was slated to feature alternate level objectives, similar to <a href="/sonic-adventure-2/3030-19060/" data-ref-id="3030-19060">Sonic Adventure 2</a>. Unused mission description text exists tasking you to get to the goal ring within a specific time limit, finding a newly re-located goal ring, collecting a specific amount of rings, defeating all the enemies, and clearing the mini-game.</li><li>More Level Objective text exists, possibly relating to the game's cut multiplayer modes: "Get to the goal ring before the ghost" and "Get to the goal ring before your rival" - Ghost possibly a reference to time trial ghosts, a feature often seen in racing games. However, no such ghost feature or mode exists in the final release.</li><li>The Tokyo Game Show 2006 trailer for the game showcases a build of Sonic the Hedgehog (2006) that is somewhat different from the final release. There are a large number of additional visual effects and complex animations present in the TGS 2006 trailer that simply do not exist in the final retail version of the game.</li><li>Even though customizing Sonic's abilities was one of the game's selling points, the final retail game features almost no customization at all. Most ability upgrades are required in order to finish the game, and while the player can purchase special gems near the end of Sonic's story, they cannot be "customized" in any way shape or form - once equipped, you have them forever.</li><li>The instruction manual for Sonic the Hedgehog (2006) contains a number of inaccuracies that do not accurately reflect the final game. For example: It describes the possibility of leveling up abilities equipped to the action gauge up to three levels of "maturity". The action gauge is never used like this by any character in the game, and unless he's carrying Princess Elise, Sonic's action gauge is never used for anything.</li><li>The manual also makes reference to a green shield power-up (similar to one seen in past Sonic games). No shield power is ever acquired from item pickups, nor is any green shield power-up ever accessible.</li><li>In addition, the manual also mentions that Tails and Omega can only fly until their "Flight Gauge" depletes. No flight gauge is ever visible, and Omega cannot fly - only hover.</li><li>Even prior to attaining it, the text for the Xbox 360 <a href="/achievements/3015-29/" data-ref-id="3015-29">achievement</a> "<a href="../../achievements/nights-of-kronos/96045/" rel="nofollow">Nights of Kronos</a>" suggests there is an alternate ending sequence to the game. (The achievement writes: "Unlock the complete ending to the last hidden story.") Meeting the requirements to get the achievement (S-Rank the entire Last Episode) does not actually change anything about the ending.</li><li>Early design documents state that Silver's original name was "Venice" and Princess Elise's name was at one point "Oliga".</li><li><figure data-ref-id="1300-732351" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1486/732351-madonna.jpg" data-size="small" data-align="right" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.73613766730402" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:73.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1486/732351-madonna.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-732351"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1486/732351-madonna.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1486/732351-madonna.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Early Sonic 1 concept art for the lost "Madonna" character. </figcaption></figure> Princess Elise and her role as a human "damsel in distress" is similar to a scrapped concept for the original <a href="/sonic-the-hedgehog/3030-2465/" data-ref-id="3030-2465">Sonic the Hedgehog (1991)</a> on Sega Genesis, where Sonic was tasked with rescuing a love interest named Madonna.</li><li>During Shadow's story, the Scepter of Darkness is mistakenly referred to as the "Book of Darkness" in the subtitles.</li><li>One of the very first leaked images of this game purported it was set to release on the Xbox 360, Playstation 3, and <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">Personal Computer</a>.

It was sold with a price of $19.99 US plus tax. The title was eventually de-listed from the service a year later, in an effort made by Sega to remove "poorly rated Sonic titles" from the marketplace.</li></ul>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>20584</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/2090577-box_sth.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/2090577-box_sth.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/2090577-box_sth.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/2090577-box_sth.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/2090577-box_sth.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2090577-box_sth.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/2090577-box_sth.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Sonic the Hedgehog]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>8</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-36/]]></api_detail_url><id>36</id><name><![CDATA[PEGI: 12+]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-29/]]></api_detail_url><id>29</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: E10+]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-25/]]></api_detail_url><id>25</id><name><![CDATA[CERO: A]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2006-11-14 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/sonic-the-hedgehog/3030-20584/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[gt5, gt5p]]></aliases><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20597/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-05-17 13:19:39</date_added><date_last_updated>2015-02-20 19:24:35</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[Get your first taste of a legitimately online Gran Turismo game in this relatively bite-sized Gran Turismo release for the PlayStation 3.  ]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<p style="">Gran Turismo 5 Prologue is the first commercial <a data-ref-id="3025-263" href="/gran-turismo/3025-263/" slug="gran-turismo">                  Gran Turismo </a>product available for the <a data-ref-id="3045-35" href="/playstation-3/3045-35/" slug="playstation-3">                 PlayStation 3</a>.

The franchise is extremely popular in Japan and Out of Bounds was released as the 10 year anniversary of the series. The game was released on March 18, 2008, almost a full year after its release in Japan.</p><h2>Playable Game Modes</h2><h3>Single-Player</h3><p style=""><b>Challenge</b>: Challenge mode pits the player playing in tournaments that either have specific rules enforced or have prizes by finishing first. Many special clubs and characters are unlocked from this mode.</p><p style=""><b>Stroke</b>: A single round of nine or eighteen holes of golf is played. At the end of each round, the character's loyalty level increases based upon the score of the round of golf played.</p><p style=""><b>Training</b>: Allows the player to practice a particular shot anywhere on a hole in a course with the option to change the weather to their liking.</p><h3>Local Multiplayer (2 to 4 Players)</h3><p style=""><b>Stroke</b>: A single round of stroke competition up to four players is played. The golfer with the lowest score wins.</p><p style=""><b>Match</b>: In Match Play, the golfer who wins the most holes wins the round. For a golfer to win a hole, they must have the lowest score on the hole played.</p><h3>Online Multiplayer</h3><p style="">Players can enter into a tournament from a listed schedule once they enter into a lobby. Each tournament has certain rules and restrictions enforced such as playing as a specific character, or landing on a sand trap results in a two stroke penalty. The player can reserve a slot for a tournament in advance and will be entered once the time of the event hits.</p><p style="">Once in the tournament, the player has to finish every hole within a certain time limit or else they will be "timed out" and returned back to the online lobby. If a player finishes a hole early, they proceed over to the standings screen where they can converse with other online golfers before the time expires and all golfers proceed to the next hole. The tournament ends with all holes played and the player will receive experience points based on their performance.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Shot Method</h3><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12009-hotshots_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12009" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12009-hotshots_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12009"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/26/12009-hotshots_02.jpg"></a><figcaption>Fernando hits a nice shot using the advanced swing method.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Hot Shots Golf: Out of Bounds provides three shot methods to play.</p><p style=""><b>Advanced</b>: The advanced shot method is the new shot method introduced in Hot Shots Golf: Out of Bounds as a new variant of the three-button swing mechanic.</p><p style="">The first button initiates the swing by starting the golfer's backswing animation. The player determines the power of the swing with the second button, by hitting the swing button at their desired point during the backswing. The farther back the button is pressed during the backswing, more power is put into the shot. The final button determines the control of the shot. The player hits the button as the white circle enters into the impact circle. The closer the white circle is inside the impact circle, the shot will be more accurate to where the player wants to aim the ball toward.</p><p style=""><b>Traditional</b>: The traditional shot method continues to power-gauge, three-button method used from previous installments.</p><p style="">The first button initiates the gauge by displaying a moving white dash starting from the right side of the gauge. The second button determines the power of the shot when the player hits the shot button as the moving white dash makes it way toward the left side of the gauge. The farther left the dash is marked on the gauge, the harder the shot. The third button determines the accuracy of the shot when the player hits the shot button as the white dash returns back to the right side of the gauge. The closer the dash is marked from the starting point of the gauge, the shot will be more accurate.</p><p style=""><b>Active Golf (Move Support):</b> In 2012, Clap Handz updated Hot Shots Golf: Out of Bounds by introducing a new mode called Active Golf, which utilizes the Playstation Move controller. Players now perform the golf swing using the move controller instead of using the three-button method from the other two methods.</p><h3>Special Shots</h3><p style=""><b>Perfect Impact</b>: If the player stops the moving dash on the white line on the right end of the power gauge, or if they hit the shot button where the white circle collapses into a dot in the center of the impact circle, a perfect impact is earned. A musical note will pop up if the player has successfully performed a perfect impact. A perfect impact shot will have the ball land near where the player desired the ball to land at.</p><p style=""><b>Adjusted Shot</b>: After the player has set his power during the second portion of the swing, the player can adjust the power slightly higher or lower by pressing either the triangle or circle button on the final portion of the swing to make the power adjustment.</p><p style=""><b>Power Shot</b>: Increases the power (distance) of the shot. There is a limit amount of power shots the player can use while in play on course.</p><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12008-hotshots_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12008" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12008-hotshots_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12008"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/26/12008-hotshots_01.jpg"></a><figcaption>Fernando hits a full power shot off the tee.</figcaption></figure><p style=""><b>Full Power Shot</b>: Considerably increases the golfer's power in exchange of their control of the shot. Limited for use with the 1W club only.</p><p style=""><b>Curving Shot</b>: Creates an extreme bending left-to-right or right-to-left ball flight. This shot is used when a ball in its normal shot would be impeded by an obstacle direct in its path.</p><p style=""><b>Topspin</b>: A shot where the ball continues to roll forward once it lands on a surface.</p><p style=""><b>Backspin</b>: A shot where the ball rolls backward once it lands on a surface.</p><p style=""><b>Rising Shot</b>: A special shot where a topspin ball hits the flagpole, the ball rolls upward along the flagpole, flies off the flagpole, then lands in the vicinity of the hole.</p><p style=""><b>Homing Shot</b>: A special shot where a backspin ball hits the flagpole, the ball automatically homes in toward the hole. Sometimes, multiple homing attempts toward the ball occur. Not all homing shots results in the ball falling into the hole.</p><h3>Golf Clubs and Balls</h3><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12011-hotshots_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12011" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/12011-hotshots_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-12011"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/26/12011-hotshots_04.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/26/12011-hotshots_04.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Selection screen for shot method, golf club and golf ball.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Hot Shots Golf: Out of Bounds has a selection of special golf clubs and balls that changes a golfer's characteristics depending on what combination of clubs and balls are selected.</p><p style=""><b><u>Clubs</u></b></p><ul><li><b>Standard</b>: The golfer's characteristics remain as they are.</li><li><b>Everybody's</b>: This club automatically takes care of the last step of the golf swing for the player, giving the player an automatic "perfect impact." However, using this club considerably diminishes the golfer's power.</li><li><b>Beginner's</b>: Increases the golfer's impact zone to allow players an increased area to hit an accurate golf shot in turn for the golfer's power.</li><li><b>Big Air</b>: Increases the golfer's power in turn of their impact zone.</li><li><b>Pin Hole</b>: Increases the golfer's control in turn of their impact zone.</li><li><b>Turbo Spin</b>: Increases the golfer's spins in turn of their impact zone.</li><li><b>Infinity</b>: Slightly increases the golfer's power, control and spin characteristics in turn of their impact zone.</li><li><b>Big Magnum</b>: Considerably increases the golfer's power at the expense of their control and impact zone.</li></ul><p style=""><b><u>Balls</u></b></p><ul><li><b>Standard</b>: The golfer's characteristics remain as they are.</li><li><b>Straight</b>: This ball makes all golfers swing a straight shot (in turn of a draw or a fade), some power is sacrificed.</li><li><b>Beginner's</b>: Increases the golfer's impact zone in turn of their power.</li><li><b>Big Air</b>: Increases the golfer's power in turn of their control.</li><li><b>Pin Hole</b>: Increases the golfer's control in turn of their sidespin.</li><li><b>Infinity</b>: Slightly increases the golfer's power, control and spin in turn of their sidespin.</li><li><b>Sidespin</b>: Considerably increases the golfer's sidespin at the expense of their control.</li><li><b>Sand Viper</b>: Increases the golfer's ability to hit a more powerful and accurate shot out of sandy surfaces. The golfer's characteristics remain the same.</li><li><b>Grass Cutter</b>: Increases the golfer's ability to hit a more powerful and accurate shot out of rough surfaces.</li></ul><h3>Loyalty</h3><p style="">Players accumulate loyalty for the character after every event completed. Bonus perks are awarded when the character's loyalty level fills up. Some perks awarded after completion of a loyalty level are additional costumes, increased number of power shots, and increased hole in ability from homing shots.</p><h2>Golfers</h2><p style="">Hot Shots Golf: Out of Bounds has a total of fifteen golfers of various difficulty levels available to play. Players can unlock all characters by defeating them in one-on-one match play rules in challenge mode. Each golfer is rated by a letter grade in five golfing characteristics: power, control, impact, spin, and sidespin, where S is the highest letter grade and E is the lowest.</p><h3>Beginner Level Golfers</h3><p style="">Beginner level golfers have a high impact zone that allows players a great shot if they hit the final shot button far away from the center impact zone and remain high (though lowered a bit) when special clubs and balls are selected. However, beginner golfers have very low power compared to their intermediate and expert golfers.</p><p style=""><b>Jasmine</b>: She picked up the game after watching her father practice on the range and now golfs everyday to eventually beat her father's score.</p><p style=""><b>Nick</b>: Gained love for the game after watching a televised golf battle. Hopes to play against his golf hero Shigeki Maruyama.</p><p style=""><b>Sophie</b>: Became interested in golf at a young age as her family owns a golf course inside the family estate.</p><p style=""><b>Bjorn</b>: A shy but enthusiastic golfer who always strives to improve his game even if his game isn't going well.</p><p style=""><b>Suzuki</b>: Chairman of the Hot Shots Golf Association. Loves to use jokes from TV sitcoms.</p><h3>Intermediate Level Golfers</h3><p style="">Intermediate level golfers have much higher power than the beginner golfers, but their impact zones are lower. Their lower impact zones requires the player to land their final shot button much closer toward the center impact zone. All intermediate golfers have well-rounded stats.</p><p style=""><b>Sasha</b>: A famous action film star who has committed more time in perfecting her golf game.</p><p style=""><b>Felipe</b>: Son of a Hollywood actor and frequents golf courses during his travels around the world.</p><p style=""><b>Sonia</b>: A world famous dancer who has turned her attention to golf.</p><p style=""><b>Bloom</b>: A Brazilian street performer who worked at a local golf course to make ends meat. He befriended Sonia one day at the golf course and learned the game from her.</p><p style=""><b>Fernando</b>: A top corporate worker with a high passion for golf.</p><h3>Expert Level Golfers</h3><p style="">Expert level golfers have the lowest impact zones, requiring players to land very close or even land directly in the center impact zone to get off a great shot. In turn for their low impact, expert golfers have significant power and have high grades in one or two other stats.</p><p style=""><b>L.J.</b>: A talented baseball and football player takes up golf as his new sport to master.</p><p style=""><b>Kate</b>: A mysterious woman with no known information about her past.</p><p style=""><b>Dino</b>: A former top-pro golfer who has given his golf winnings toward environmental causes.</p><p style=""><b>Anya</b>: A major financial figure and wife of an oil tycoon. She learned and improved her golf game by recruiting numerous golf coaches.</p><p style=""><b>Shigeki Maruyama</b>: A world-famous pro golfer who has an easy-going demeanor, but turns into an intense competitor during golf competition.</p><h2>Caddies</h2><p style="">The caddies in Hot Shots Golf: Out of Bounds provide some vocal assistance during the course of play. On the green, they will tell the player what direction the ball will go and if the ball is going up or down a slope. On the fairway, they warn players on certain club shots taken on the rough of hitting "flyers", where the ball will go farther than the intended length desired. Caddies can also indicate whether the shot looks like it's going to land close to the hole on the green, or heading out of bounds by yelling "FORE" after the shot is taken.</p><p style="">All seven caddies available to select from the start of the game.</p><p style=""><b>Hannah</b>: An energetic caddie who worries for others over herself.</p><p style=""><b>Bonnie</b>: A caddie with a heartwarming personality who provides support for her golfers with enthusiasm and soothing voice.</p><p style=""><b>Trent</b>: A caddie who is enamored with the mental aspects of golf.</p><p style=""><b>Rina</b>: A Hot Shots caddie favorite who has an intense hatred of insects.</p><p style=""><b>Eva</b>: A tall, athletic, blunt-spoken but cheerful woman who was a former pro golfer before turning to work as a caddie.</p><p style=""><b>Clark</b>: A 30-year golf caddie who's a bit theatrical in his mannerisms.</p><p style=""><b>Maru-Chan</b>: A former pro golfer with tons of golfing experience developed in the years on the pro tour takes his turn as a golf caddie.</p><h2>Golf Courses</h2><p style="">There are six golf courses available to play in Hot Shots Golf: Out of Bounds. Each course can be played in nine or eighteen holes and from the front or back tees.</p><p style=""><b>Highland C.C.</b>: A course for beginners to start sharpening their skills on with wide fairways and greens and few traps.</p><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/692083-everybodys_golf_world_tour_80182.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-692083" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/692083-everybodys_golf_world_tour_80182.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-692083"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/56/692083-everybodys_golf_world_tour_80182.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/56/692083-everybodys_golf_world_tour_80182.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Euro Classic C.C.</figcaption></figure><p style=""><b>Okinawa Golf Resort</b>: A golf course on a seaside resort.

The game was released on May 26, 2009 in <a href="/north-america/3035-1664/" data-ref-id="3035-1664">North America</a>, and May 29, 2009 in <a href="/europe/3035-289/" data-ref-id="3035-289">Europe</a>. <i>inFamous</i> has the player assume the role of <a href="/cole-mcgrath/3005-6399/" data-ref-id="3005-6399">Cole MacGrath</a>, a bike messenger who gains electrical <a href="/superpowers/3015-3757/" data-ref-id="3015-3757">superpowers</a> after a mysterious explosion.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">Cole's greatest strength and weakness comes from the source of his electrical powers. Cole's inability to generate his own energy to fuel his powers forces him to rely on the city's unreliable power grid, making players constantly manipulate the city's energy in order to use it for themselves. When Cole is in an area with power, he is able to constantly recharge his supply through the use of <a href="/public-phone/3055-1373/" data-ref-id="3055-1373">pay phones</a>, <a href="/lamp-post/3055-2748/" data-ref-id="3055-2748">lamp posts</a> and other sources of electricity. Sucker Punch's Nate Fox claimed that players must be wary of rolling brownouts that will randomly occur throughout the city, which prevents players from recharging Cole's powers. In reality, the game contains no such feature. However, certain regions of the city are separated from the power grid, and Cole must venture into them to return the electricity to the area. When Cole is in a powerless region of the city, his vision becomes blurred and he can only charge his powers from car batteries (which only give a small boost) or roof-mounted generators.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33306/1027501-img_128802_infamous_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1027501" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.74888888888889" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:74.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33306/1027501-img_128802_infamous_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1027501"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33306/1027501-img_128802_infamous_1.jpg"></a><figcaption>Cole using his electrical powers.</figcaption></figure><p style="">All of Cole's powers revolve around electrical based attacks. Featured attacks include the ability to shoot electricity out of his hands, call upon <a href="/lightning/3055-1807/" data-ref-id="3055-1807">lightning</a> from the sky, a shock wave that can push enemies and objects, and the ability to create a <a href="/grenade/3055-111/" data-ref-id="3055-111">grenade</a>-like ball of lightning.</p><p style="">Cole is unable to use guns or drive cars because the electricity in his body would ignite the ammunition or gas, causing them to explode. In addition, Cole has a decided weakness to water; his current flows into any standing water, such that full body submersion would instantly electrocute him. Showers of water cause pain as well, so it is mentioned in the backstory that Cole is now forced to sponge bathe.</p><p style="">Cole also has more esoteric uses of his ability, such as his "post-cognition" power, which allows Cole to read the residual electrical energy in the brain of a recently deceased person, in order to learn the cause of their death. Cole can also ride along electrified <a href="/power-line/3055-2849/" data-ref-id="3055-2849">power lines</a> and <a href="/rail-track/3055-1259/" data-ref-id="3055-1259">train tracks</a>, which allows Cole to travel around Empire City more easily.</p><p style="">inFamous players to make moral decisions, as well. Cole can choose whether to help or hurt the civilians of Empire City, and his actions will not only affect how citizens react to him, but also affect which of the two endings the player can see. If Cole is kind to the citizens of Empire City, they will adore him and help him out whenever possible. But if players choose to attack civilians, the citizens will resent Cole and cower in fear. The player's karma status will have a visual effect on Cole's electricity based powers. For example, players with Good Karma will have blue lightning bolts, whereas players with Evil Karma will have red lightning bolts. Good Karma powers are more centered around catching bad guys alive and not harming civilians whereas the Evil Karma powers are more explosive and dangerous. Filling the positive Karma meter will gain Cole the title of Hero, while filling the negative Karma meter will label him, perhaps more appropriately, Infamous.</p><p style="">inFamous does not auto-pause if the DualShock 3 controller battery dies, a problem fixed in the sequel.</p><h2>Characters</h2><h3><a href="/cole-mcgrath/3005-6399/" data-ref-id="3005-6399">Cole MacGrath</a></h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/24/176204-hero_screen_and_depth_93.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-176204" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/24/176204-hero_screen_and_depth_93.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-176204"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/24/176204-hero_screen_and_depth_93.jpg"></a><figcaption>Cole</figcaption></figure><p style="">The hero or villain of inFamous.

Without the police, gangs have taken over areas of the city and a plague has infected many of the residents causing the city to be quarantined by the government.</p><p style="">A video signal jacker who refers to himself as "the Voice of Survival," periodically hacks into public broadcasts and sends out his own pirate messages about survival information for Empire City civilians, reveals that Cole was the cause of the explosion, thus setting the population of Empire City (even his girlfriend, Trish) against him. Cole must come to terms with his powers, decide whether to help those in need or serve his own self interests, and face off against larger threats that have manifested in the city due to the explosion and its aftermath.</p><p style="">According to inFamous producer Nate Fox, the team wanted to have Cole be "a kind of an everyman," so that they could then "get into the headspace of what it would be like to be a real human being who has been granted these exceptional abilities." While Cole is the only playable character, he is joined by two friends; Zeke, a fellow bike messenger, conspiracy theorist and survivalist who becomes jealous of Cole's powers, and Trish, Cole's ex-girlfriend and medical student who resents him due to her sister being killed in the blast but still helps in treating the injured, a "Lois Lane with syringes" as stated by Sucker Punch.</p><p style=""> </p><h2>Powers</h2><p style="">Throughout the game Cole is able to spend experience points to upgrade numerous powers that are acquired during the game. Most of the powers are the same for the good and bad archetype paths but have slight differences. For example both archetypes can use shock grenades, but the good archetype grenades increase enemy knockdown time while the evil ones split into multiple clusters which increases their blast radius.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1717/1099414-541px_infamous1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1099414" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.1090573012939" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:110.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1717/1099414-541px_infamous1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1099414"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1717/1099414-541px_infamous1.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1717/1099414-541px_infamous1.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Cole firing a Lightning Bolt.</figcaption></figure><p style=""><u><b>Lightning Bolt</b></u> - Fires a single bolt of electricity at an enemy.

This sequel to the 2004 <a href="../../playstation-2/60-19/" rel="nofollow"> PS2</a> title from <a href="../../guerrilla-games/65-2392/" rel="nofollow"> Guerrilla Games </a>was first announced during Sony's E3 2005 press conference via a pre-rendered teaser trailer. The footage left many in awe, and even more in speculation debating the legitimacy of the trailer being real gameplay. Later, it was confirmed and clarified by Sony that the footage was indeed a computer generated target render, leaving many disappointed.</p><p style="">The game utilizes an intuitive <a href="../../cover-system/92-55/" rel="nofollow"> cover system</a>, referred to by the developers as "lean and peek." Guerrilla strived toward the creation of a cinematic gameplay experience. In what they call "Hollywood Realism", the camera perspective remains in first person for the vast majority of the game, with the HUD being minimalist. That includes moments where the player must take cover, climb ladders, and when cut scenes gain full attention. This cover system allows the player to simply hold a trigger to latch onto cover, and then move the movement-assigned analogue stick in the direction of the player's choice - whether it be up, left, or right . Virtually any position can be used as a cover anchor. The player can also enter a <a href="../../scope/93-738/" rel="nofollow"> scope</a>/<a href="../../iron-sights/92-567/" rel="nofollow"> iron sight</a> with their weapon when leaning out from behind cover. Vehicles, on the other hand, are not controlled in first-person view for the sake of streamlining.</p><p style=""><u></u> <a href="../../destructible-environment/92-243/" rel="nofollow"> Destructible environments</a> and <a href="../../destructible-cover/92-112/" rel="nofollow"> cover </a>are a crucial part of Killzone 2, with nearly every piece of cover being able to be chipped away by gunfire and explosions until only a frame remains. Less permanent objects, such as trash bags, tin cans, and chairs, are movable and destructible. According to Guerrilla, the inclusion of destructible cover was not something added for players to be able to rip everything apart until it's completely non-existent like <a href="../../battlefield-bad-company/61-20655/" rel="nofollow"> Battlefield: Bad Company</a> , but was added to further instil a more intense sense of realism, where everything in the world reacts as you would expect, and portrays movements which make sense in terms of real-world physics.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4759/342282-kz2d.png" data-ref-id="1300-342282" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.46917450365726" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:46.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4759/342282-kz2d.png" data-ref-id="1300-342282"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4759/342282-kz2d.png"></a><figcaption>SIXAXIS Motion Controls</figcaption></figure><p style="">Killzone 2 supports SIXAXIS <a href="../../motion-control/92-474/" rel="nofollow"> motion controls</a> as well, "in ways that make sense". Valves can be turned by holding the L1 and R1 buttons, the character's left and right hands, respectively, and then making a twisting motion with the controller, acting as if the player is interacting with a tangible object. C4 charges can be placed with a similar functionality, and the Sniper Rifle has a steady-shot component built in. When the player zooms in on an enemy or object, the controller must be kept completely still to ensure the greatest possible accuracy. <a href="../../jeff-gerstmann/72-89712/" rel="nofollow"> Jeff Gerstmann</a> also noted that the game's loading screens feature "quite possibly the best use of SIXAXIS technology to date".</p><p style="">Killzone 2 includes full <a href="../../trophies/92-198/" rel="nofollow"> Trophy</a> support, DualShock 3 rumble support, as well as some level of <a href="../../playstation-home/61-22581/" rel="nofollow"> Home</a> integration.</p><p style=""><a href="http://killzone.com/kz/news.psml?kz_news_article=Killzone%202%20Patch%201.27%20Details&amp;kz_news_page=0" rel="nofollow"> Guerrilla Games released patch version 1.27</a> on June 4th, 2009, among the changes being the inclusion of a High Precision control option.

By default, this feature is set to "On" for new players and "Off" for existing players. The patch also tweaked the multiplayer portion of the game, adding a party system that allows friends to consistently stay on the same team and squad.

The ISA are now taking the war back to the enemy, in attempt to capture the Helghan leader, Emperor <a href="../../scolar-visari/94-4461/" rel="nofollow"> Scolar Visari</a>. But unlike the past games set in a world of <a href="../../helghast/92-195/" rel="nofollow"> Helghast</a> army invasion, Killzone 2 takes place on the Helghast home planet, Helghan, where a fully fledged war has begun. You play as a new character to the <a href="../../killzone/62-405/" rel="nofollow"> Killzone franchise</a>, named <a href="../../tomas-sevchenko/94-3090/" rel="nofollow"> Sev</a>, who is part of an elite four man special forces group called the Alpha Team.

The Invasion proceeds as planned until the Helghast activate their arc tower defenses, wiping out much of the first wave of the assault. </p><p style=""> </p><p style="">ISA scientist Evelyn Batton discovers that the arc towers are built out of an element called Petrusite, mainly located at Tharsus Refinery. Alpha Team is sent to find a way to disable the towers.In the course of the mission, Sev and Rico leave to activate a communications tower, and the rest of the team is kidnapped by the Helghast. They find the team being held by Colonel Radec, who is about to execute them. Rico rushes in to save the squad, resulting in Garza being killed and Radec escaping. </p><p style=""> </p><p style="">The Team returns to the New Sun, the ISA flagship, when the Helghast begin a massive assault and board much of the fleet. Colonel Radec infiltrates the bridge of the New Sun, kills Evelyn,steals the ISA nuclear strike codes, and mortally wounds Fleet Commander Jan Templar. Templar sacrifices himself, deactivating the New Sun's engines and crashes the ship into Tharsis Refinery, deactivating the city's defense grid. </p><p style=""> </p><p style="">The ISA and Alpha Team regroup to attack Visari's palace, but a nuclear bomb is detonated in the city, wiping out most of the ISA forces. The remaining soldiers storm the palace, and Alpha Team severely injures Radec, who commits suicide to avoid capture. </p><p style=""> </p><p style="">Sev and Rico confront Scolar Visari, who tells them that even if he dies, he will be a martyr to the Helghast, only strengthening their war effort.

The multiplayer features up to 32 player games (16 vs 16), 12 different military ranks to unlock, 46 different ribbons and medals to unlock, up to 64 player <a href="../../clan/92-643/" rel="nofollow"> clans</a>, 8 different maps (which vary in size), <a href="../../tournament/92-1096/" rel="nofollow"> tournaments</a> of up to 256 clans, 6 different <a href="../../classes/92-405/" rel="nofollow"> classes</a> which each have a primary and secondary ability, called badges (Total of 12 badges to mix and match), and 12 different character models (Non- customizable); two character models for each class type (ISA model/HGH version).</p><p style="">Classes in Killzone 2 offer players a way to cater to their custom play style. There are a total of 6 different unique classes; Engineer, Medic, Scout, Assault, Tactician, &amp; Saboteur. Each class has two badges; a primary and secondary badge (the primary badge determines character model), which are tailored to that classes' specific play style.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4759/189216-killzone_2_multiplayer__6_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-189216" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4759/189216-killzone_2_multiplayer__6_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-189216"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4759/189216-killzone_2_multiplayer__6_.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4759/189216-killzone_2_multiplayer__6_.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Online Multiplayer Sniper</figcaption></figure><p style="">For example, the Medic's primary badge ability gives the player access to a specialized <a href="../../weapons-swap/92-1062/" rel="nofollow"> weapon</a> that can heal downed/injured teammates (by shooting an electric charge at them). The secondary badge allows medics to toss a <a href="../../health-pack/93-255/" rel="nofollow"> health pack</a> which other players can pick up. But the unique aspect of classes in Killzone 2, is the combining of badges; for example, a player could take the primary badge of the Saboteur class (Which allows the player to disguise themselves as randomly selected enemy player), and the secondary badge of the Assault class (Which temporarily increases running speed), allowing the player to run faster <i>and </i>be disguised as the enemy. You can change your badge ability combination depending on what game type you are playing as well. The above badge combination for example, may best suit your play style for a game of <a href="../../capture-the-flag/92-25/" rel="nofollow"> capture the flag</a>. Since each player may have their own combination of badges, this changes the multiplayer experience greatly, both on a strategic level as well as suiting to your preferred play style. Note that not all badges/abilities will be accessible from the start, players have to unlock some classes fully (secondary abilities) by ranking up.</p><p style="">Killzone's multiplayer also features robust clan support, with up to 64 player clans, clan <a href="../../leaderboard/92-30/" rel="nofollow"> leaderboards</a>, and clan tournaments. You can even setup clan challenges against other clans in-game, this is where the 'Clan Valor' system comes in. Valor is KZ2's online currency for clans; whichever clan has more valor points, the higher they are on the leaderboards. Though clans start off with a certain amount of valor to get started, in order for them to climb up the leaderboards they must challenge other clans and bid a certain amount of their valor; whoever wins the game takes all. This system is similar to gambling, where in order to gain more, you must risk more, though here in the end one of the two clans will always end up losing valor, which also means moving down on the leaderboards. If a clan has somehow lost all of their valor points, they will be unable to challenge other clans and be forced to play in specific tournaments in order to gain enough valor to start challenging other clans again. Tournaments can also be made, allowing up to 256 clans to compete against each other, giving them a chance to win large amounts of valor points.</p><p style="">Although certain players have the ability to request air support from <a href="../../ai-bots/92-597/" rel="nofollow"> AI controlled</a><a href="../../ai-bots/92-597/" rel="nofollow"> sentry bots</a>, vehicle support was not included on release and despite rumors to the contrary has not appeared through a patch to the game.</p><p style="">Guerrilla is also trying to differentiate Killzone 2's multiplayer experience from most shooters on the market, with the introduction of other unique aspects (alongside classes and much more), such as in-game squad mechanics, trustworthy spawning system, as well improving the general flow/pacing of action. Through in-game mechanics, players can easily create a new squad on their team, which other teammates can join on-the-fly. Anywhere from 2 to 8 players can be in a specific squad, allowing a maximum of 8 squads per team if they so choose. Players in a squad will also share unique information amongst each other, such as the squads overall health, each players specific badges/ class combinations, as well as a custom chat channel. Spawning in online is also made easy; After death the map will be displayed, as well as what spawn points are available to choose from, to the left of the map is a live video feed of what is going on at whichever spawn point you have selected. This means you will have no one to blame for spawning in the middle of an explosive battle but yourself. The player can also choose to spawn on the squad leader (if in a squad), making it easier to always stay close and never get separated. Something else you don't regularly see in other multiplayer games, is a constant flow of action. In Killzone 2, after completing a specific task or mission, the game doesn't bring up a lobby screen or menu, it dynamically continues the game and pulls up the next mission, creating a constant flow of action.</p><p style="">Apart from players being able to automatically join a game using the 'Quick Join' feature (which attempts to match you up with players of similar skill level), Guerrilla has also stressed how important it is to them to allow users to "play what he wants to play". As well as trying to fulfill this goal with the custom classes system, players can also create custom games whenever and however they want. Customizations include the obvious features such as what maps, gameplay modes, and weapons are supported, but also deeper things such as how the classes work. The game will include official dedicated servers from Sony, as well as players' custom servers. Guerrilla promises to enable players with customizations to create their gameplay experience the way they want it to be in Killzone 2 online multiplayer.</p><p style="">Killzone 2 is heavily tied into Guerrilla's online website, <a href="http://www.killzone.com/kz/" rel="nofollow"> Killzone.com</a>. Users are able to link their <a href="../../playstation-network/60-88/" rel="nofollow"> PlayStation Network</a> ID to the site, in order for their online, and even single player stats to be monitored, tracked, and shared amongst the community. As well as having access to the sites forums, Guerrilla Games news updates, and more, each player will has their own profile displaying all kinds of Killzone 2 stats, as well as <a href="../../killzone-liberation/61-5556/" rel="nofollow"> Killzone Liberation</a> (PSP) stats. Statistics include everything from leaderboards rank, current clan, favorite gametype, weapon, map, or class, to awards such as medals and ribbons. <b> </b></p><p style=""> </p><h2>Multiplayer Modes</h2><ul><li><b>Assassination:</b> One team member is the target and one team has to keep him safe, the other has to take him out.</li><li><b>Body Count:</b> Similar to traditional team death match game play.</li><li><b>Search and Destroy:</b> Defend an objective and make sure the other faction does not place charges.</li><li><b>Search and Retrieve:</b> Bring the propaganda pack to the drop-off point and try and stop the other faction from taking it to theirs.</li><li><b>Capture and Hold:</b> Capture and hold points around the maps and try and keep the other faction from doing the same.</li></ul><h2>Multiplayer Classes and Abilities</h2><h3>Rifleman</h3><ul><li>This is the default multiplayer character and is assigned to the player when no primary badge is selected.

ISA Command was hoping to get an easy picking from the Helghast, thinking the security here would be slightly more lax than elsewhere. Little did they know the extent to which the Helghan army fights to hold on to every little piece of turf they own. <p style="">Opponents battle not only each other, but the elements as well - harsh blowing wind, gaping canyons, rolling terrain, and the occasional bullet flying haphazardly through the air. With over ten ammunition boxes, four mounted weapons, five square kilometers to play in, and long lines of sight for those with the keen eyes, this is the largest of the original multiplayer maps. Four bridges span the monstrous canyon just off center of the map. The bridges mark the lowest point in the map, and with either end of the map being elevated, is an area prone to sniper fire. Dead Man’s land is what they call it. Cover abounds in the map, but with the large amount of open space, it’s a race from cover to cover while trying to achieve the mission objectives. </p></td></tr><tr><td><h3>Salamun Market</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/96/925058-smconart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-925058" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.36440677966102" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:36.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/96/925058-smconart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-925058"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/96/925058-smconart.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/96/925058-smconart.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption> Salamun Market </figcaption></figure> Winding itself through Salamun Market is a road marked and scarred from recent battles, showing the importance of this area.

Boasting an outstanding fourteen ammunition boxes, twelve mounted weapons, and thirteen explosive barrels, all crammed in two and a half square kilometers, this is one intense map. Variation in navigating the map is key here, as the urban layout is quite friendly to different routes. With a nearly straight line of sight to either key end of the map, two sniper buildings make an easy and importance appearance. </p></td></tr><tr><td><h3>Helghan Industries</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/96/925054-hiconart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-925054" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.56271186440678" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/96/925054-hiconart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-925054"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/96/925054-hiconart.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/96/925054-hiconart.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption> Helghan Industries </figcaption></figure> Once a bustling experimental technology facility, Helghan Industries sealed its own doom when they failed to erase all sensitive information from the surrounding databanks, making this a focal point for the invading ISA, as well as the defending Helghan army. <p style="">Placing focus on vertical combat, Helghan Industries is one of the unique types of maps that the game has to offer. With a two tier bridge overlooking the main route through the map, an open eye is absolutely key in the map. With choke points abounding, it offers combatants a chance to show what they are made of.

In a desperate attempt to stop the brutal pounding the ISA ships are taking in orbit, numerous small drop ships have landed nearby, with the only goal of disabling the cannon, allowing for a foothold to be made in this key area. <p style="">Possibly the most complicated, multilayered map of the original set, Visari Hammer is a maze when it comes to finding your way around, and those new to the map are likely to cause as much harm trying to find their way to the firefights, as the enemy is decimating the few who did manage to stumble upon their barrels. While the map may seem small upon first glance, once you make your way through the myriad of tunnels and covered pathways, it starts showing just how large it is when you get lost from your team. Hosting just over two square kilometers of play space, fourteen ammunition boxes, and seven mounted weapons, it is quite a well balanced map. Profound knowledge of what corridors lead where is key, as you may accidentally find yourself in the opposing base, facing the business end of an automated turret. </p></td></tr><tr><td><h3>Radec Academy</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/96/925056-raconart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-925056" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.40847457627119" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:40.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/96/925056-raconart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-925056"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/96/925056-raconart.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/96/925056-raconart.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption> Radec Academy </figcaption></figure> A focal point in both the eyes of the Helghast and ISA, the Radec Academy is the main graduating source of the Helghan army.

Offering a scant one kilometer of killing space, prepare to have your abilities tested in this short lived map. Having eight ammunition boxes, and no mounted weapons, this map knows it means business. With a fair number of concrete cubes being stacked about, there is no shortage of cover. But what happens when you lose that cover, or you’re found out is when you really know what you’re made of. A control room towards the center of the map plays home to a number of the mission types, and plays quite a versatile role, as there are walkways abounding and offering little cover. With each base camp being a close boost run away, the fighting in the map is nothing short of glorious. </td></tr><tr><td><h3>Blood Gracht</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/96/925049-bgconart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-925049" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.56271186440678" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/96/925049-bgconart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-925049"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/96/925049-bgconart.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/96/925049-bgconart.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption> Blood Gracht </figcaption></figure> The canal in Blood Gracht used to be a sight on the eyes, with the residential units surrounding allowing for a scenic neighborhood.

An asymmetrical map with less than a square kilometer of killing space, this map plays host to eight ammunition boxes, and three mounted weapons. With the canal being straight as a sniper shot, it plays nearly like a shooting gallery to those sitting atop with a keen eye and quick finger. Verticality does play a more than a small role here, with a plethora of ways to get to your intended target.

With bases being at either end of the bridge, the conflict zones come into play at the top of the bridge and the base of the bridge, where the majority of the mission objectives are located. There are holes in the surfaces of the bridges, so a watchful eye on where you step is key, unless you’re comfortable with facing your enemy completely unprepared. </td></tr></tbody></table><p style=""> </p><table><tbody><tr><th>Steel &amp; Titanium Map Pack</th></tr><tr><td><h3>Vektra Cruiser</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/32533/1332520-vekta_cruiser.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1332520" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.56284153005464" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/32533/1332520-vekta_cruiser.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1332520"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/32533/1332520-vekta_cruiser.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/32533/1332520-vekta_cruiser.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption> Vekta Cruiser </figcaption></figure> This map is set on the Vektan warship from the single player game.

LittleBigPlanet can be played in both single player and 4 player co-op modes in all of the developer's levels and all of the community levels.</p><h2>Multiplayer</h2><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5338/198547-untitled.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-198547" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.58577405857741" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:58.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5338/198547-untitled.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-198547"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5338/198547-untitled.jpg"></a><figcaption>Play with your friends!</figcaption></figure><p style="">One of the game's most important features is its multiplayer components, delivered, and accessed through the PlayStation Network system. This allows players to share just about any kind of content, be it levels, objects, or tools, and collaborate on various projects together. This figures into the game's emphasis on user-generated content, and the game will ship with integrated creation tool sets available at all times that will allow the player to manipulate everything about LittleBigPlanet, such as add, subtract, morph, rotate, connect, link, and generally change any object they wish. Additionally, players can place stickers onto anything in the game world. These stickers are comprised of just about any form of image media the player puts on the their PS3, as well as included example content from Media Molecule. You will are able to use the <a href="../../playstation-eye/93-1672/" rel="nofollow">PlayStation Eye</a> or EyeToy to create stickers, objects, your <a href="../../sackboy/94-663/" rel="nofollow">Sackboy</a>/Sackgirl character, and more to use in your level. Additionally, you can play locally or online with up to 3 other friends.</p><p style="">The online level creating co-op function of LittleBigPlanet was not be available during launch; however, it will be patched in a future software update.</p><p style="">LittleBigPlanet sorts its user-created levels by sorting them onto different pages of levels. There is also a system of bookmarking a level which then makes it a "hearted" level. These levels can then be seen by other people on friend lists, and there will also be a basic search function to find a level.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/24/176641-22.png" data-ref-id="1300-176641" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/24/176641-22.png" data-ref-id="1300-176641"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/24/176641-22.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/24/176641-22.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>One of the included stages</figcaption></figure><p style="">The goal of LittleBigPlanet is to guide your sackboy across the sidescrolling levels, along the way you meet many obstacles and enemies while trying to collect the game's currency, fluff. You will be able to jump by using the X button and grab on to things by using the R1 button, along with these controls you will have full movement of your arms with the R2 and L2 buttons. You will encounter many different types of enemies along your journey. They range from simple robots that have a A.I. controlled path, to complex bosses. There will also be obstacles to avoid in the environment, players will freeze if they stand on ice for too long, and die when they jump into fire. You will also have to move around the Z-Axis to get past certain obstacles. Sackboy can also equip a jet pack, swing on ropes, and use a variety of methods for getting around.</p><p style="">LittleBigPlanet will incorporate a scoring system, a feature that in this time has become quite rare. Players will be timed at the beginning of a level, and the quicker they accomplish their task, the higher their score. Scattered throughout each level are collectible items which also add to your score, such as bubbles and sponges. A combination of time and performance will come together to determine the final score on a level.</p><p style="">In the Metal Gear Solid content pack, the Paintinator was added, similar to the jetpack, once you grab a gun your character does not lose it. You use the R1 trigger to shoot, you can hold it down for a slow automatic fire, or tap it for quicker shooting. You can jump while you have the gun, however you lose the ability to grab surfaces while you have the gun. Also your head stops moving with the SIXAXIS and instead looks to where your paint gun is pointing. You can change the direction in which the paint gun points with the right analog stick.</p><h2>Custom Content</h2><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1840/236437-littlebigplanet_screenshot_63.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-236437" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1840/236437-littlebigplanet_screenshot_63.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-236437"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1840/236437-littlebigplanet_screenshot_63.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1840/236437-littlebigplanet_screenshot_63.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>LittleBigPlanet gameplay</figcaption></figure><p style="">Perhaps the biggest part of LittleBigPlanet is the total freedom players are given to manipulate the world, making it their own. A great emphasis has been placed on creating custom level content and sharing it with the world. Included in LittleBigPlanet is an in depth level design system, and it is accessible to players once they complete three levels of the main, commercial set of levels. In the level creator, players have access to a plethora of items to put in their levels. Snakes, skateboards, boxes, bubbles, and more are available, and players can even combine items to make something completely new. Joints, elastic bands, and glue are included to combine whatever the player imagines. Players can rotate objects, change their size, and place them anywhere. The game has it's own physics engine, which will effect all of these objects. Objects can be crafted from glass, metal, sponge, polystyrene (foam), and rubber, and each material will have true-to life properties.</p><p style="">In addition to the included objects, players can make their own or use objects created by others. You can even make your objects prizes for completing custom levels. Other objects can be obtained by playing through the main game and collecting bubbles. The built in level editor includes a plethora of tools that allow players to customize every last detail of their created objects. They can use a variety of objects, textures and colors, and trim and polish their objects for hours. Joints, wheels, and other mechanisms can help players make objects that move, and special items can be placed to make them react when players reach certain areas.</p><p style="">Players can further customize levels by placing stickers on objects throughout their own levels. LittleBigPlanet includes a base set of stickers, however, using the PlayStation Eye camera, players can take pictures of themselves to plaster on their level for the world to see. Many have also used the PlayStation Eye functionality to create their own textures and characters to add into their levels.</p><p style="">When players create content, they can post it on the web for the world to see. The game features an in depth search system and rating system so that players can find levels tat serve a wide variety of interests. The main "moon" also displays a number of the most popular levels, which players can access with ease. Each level has a screen with key word descriptors to give players a basic idea of the stage, as well as lists of comments from players who played through the stage.</p><p style="">The editor has been proven to be quite flexible. Many have created levels within LittleBigPlanet that go beyond the intended platformer. The ever popular music levels have been created, along with scrolling shooters, puzzle games, sports games, and many others. Players have gone beyond the intended limits, creating some truly innovative and creative things. Some have even managed to re-create games like <a href="../../contra/61-4350/" rel="nofollow">Contra</a> and <a href="../../gradius/61-15508/" rel="nofollow">Gradius</a>, games not much like LittleBigPlanet at all.</p><h2>Metal Gear Solid Custom Content</h2><p style="">On December 2008, Media Molecule released for 6 dollars a series of levels based on Metal Gear solid, along with the paintinator upgrade. These 6 levels focused on Liquid Ocelot's creation of a trophy level machine which would flood the world with his creations. Alongside with this: another 6 dollar pack of 4 MGS costumes was released, including, Meryl, Old Snake, Psycho Mantis, and Ninja Raiden. Release of this content has been received generally positively and exceeded expectations.</p><h2>Character Customization</h2><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5285/194204-unbelievably_cute.png" data-ref-id="1300-194204" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.76288659793814" data-width="194" style="width: 194px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:76.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5285/194204-unbelievably_cute.png" data-ref-id="1300-194204"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5285/194204-unbelievably_cute.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5285/194204-unbelievably_cute.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Unbelievably Cute Sack Boy</figcaption></figure><p style="">One of the more unique aspects of LittleBigPlanet is its character customization system. Players can equip their adorable sackboy or sackgirl with a plethora of costume pieces such as hats, shirts, pants, hairstyles and props (swords, wands etc). Players also choose an initial material for the 'skin' of the sackperson. In addition, downloadable costumes based on holiday themes and video game characters are added on for download on PSN on a frequent basis.</p><h2>History</h2><p style=""><a href="../../david-reeves/72-46990/" rel="nofollow">David Reeves</a>, president of <a href="../../sony-computer-entertainment-europe/65-46/" rel="nofollow">SCEE</a> made quite a stir in the community when he announced that users will be able to charge for created content. Says Reeves, "What we're trying to do with LittleBigPlanet is almost iTunes meets eBay in the sense that once an individual or a developer has qualified by producing certain levels or certain add-ons, they will then be able in the future to exchange these and make money out of them." He added, "Eventually, it's feasible that you might well see the first LittleBigPlanet millionaire!". While quite a strong claim, it is still undetermined what exactly the qualification is to be able to sell content, and what the pricing structure might look like.</p><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2739/510192-kratos_nariko.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-510192" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.49277266754271" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:49.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2739/510192-kratos_nariko.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-510192"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2739/510192-kratos_nariko.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2739/510192-kratos_nariko.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Kratos and Nariko Sackboy characters, shown with LittleBigGameSack.</figcaption></figure><p style="">This was later clarified by both David Reeves and Alex Evans as being a possibility that may be done in the future: "LBP can do X, Y or Z - and that's where it was misinterpreted, that we will do X, Y or Z. " Evans intends to wait for the reaction of the community before putting any such system in place, but is reluctant to comment further on their plans. Evans states that "if we can find ways to incentivise people to make fantastic levels, we'll do it", but is quick to clarify that by saying "the last thing we want to do is piss anybody off, or reduce the size of the community".</p><p style="">In early August '08, Sony announced that <a href="http://blog.us.playstation.com/2008/08/05/littlebigplanet-pre-order-goodness/" rel="nofollow">pre-order bonus characters</a> <a href="../../kratos/94-645/" rel="nofollow">Kratos</a> ( <a href="../../god-of-war/62-244/" rel="nofollow">God of War</a>) and <a href="../../nariko/94-755/" rel="nofollow">Nariko</a> ( <a href="../../heavenly-sword/61-7876/" rel="nofollow">Heavenly Sword</a>) would be made available at various outlets across North America and most parts of Europe.

In 2009 however, both the Kratos and Nariko characters were released as DLC for all regions, negating all exclusivity. For those who purchased the game in the first week, there was a free spacesuit costume for Sackboy, only available for download in the first week. A special "I Was There Week 1" t-shirt was also promised, but ended up costing a whopping 5 dollars.</p><p style="">During the Leipzig Games Convention, <a href="../../peter-smith/72-17358/" rel="nofollow">Pete Smith</a>, senior producer for LittleBigPlanet, revealed that user generated content published by users on the PSN will be region specific, due to the fact that each territory will be getting their own dedicated server. However, Sony would later deny this report by indicating that the issue of having content on their own dedicated server is being worked around, thus stating that LittleBigPlanet's content will not be region-locked.</p><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11423/727665-002.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-727665" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11423/727665-002.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-727665"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11423/727665-002.jpeg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11423/727665-002.jpeg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Snake and Sephiroth Sackboys</figcaption></figure><p style="">It was announced on September 22nd, 2008 by a developer on the PlayStation.com Forums that LittleBigPlanet would not include the ability to create levels in online multiplayer at launch, although this feature will later be included in a free update. Players will still be able to create levels offline and share and play them online at launch.</p><p style="">On October 8th, 2008 Sony showed new costumes for Sackboy at the Tokyo Game Show. Players will be able to make Sackboy stealthy assassin <a href="../../solid-snake/94-75/" rel="nofollow">Old Snake</a> or <a href="../../final-fantasy-vii/61-13053/" rel="nofollow">Final Fantasy VII</a> antagonist <a href="../../sephiroth/94-511/" rel="nofollow">Sephiroth</a>. On December 16, 2008 Sony announced the release of the first "Level Pack" for LittleBigPlanet. These "Level Packs" will bundle multiple items into one convenient download. The pack is the Festive Level Pack and will only be available until January 8th, 2009.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p style="">There are two different types of music tracks in the game: stand-alone tracks and Interactive Music. While simple stand-alone songs are pretty self-explanatory, interactive music are songs that the player can customize up to six different instruments to have the atmosphere proper for their level. More recent, orchestrated tracks have the option of low or high intensity.</p><p style="">In the entire soundtrack, two songs have earned their place in the history of LittleBigPlanet. The first one being "Get It Together" by The Go! Team, the song used during the first live demo of the game at GDC '07 and also the song most people associate with the game. The second one is Tapha Niang by Toumani Diabate's Symmetric Orchestra, which was the cause of a last minute delay of the game in 2008. Sony found that the lyrics of the song make references to the Qu'ran ('Every soul shall have the taste of death', 'All that is on earth will perish'), and deemed the lyrics could be perceived as offensive. The song is still in the final built, although now instrumental.</p><h3>Music</h3><ul><li>Ananda Shankar - "Dancing Drums"</li><li>Battles - "Atlas"</li><li>Cafe Tacvba - "Volver a Comenzar"</li><li>The Daniel Pemberton TV Orchestra - "Cries in the Wind"</li><li>The Daniel Pemberton TV Orchestra - "Girly Goodie Two Shoes"</li><li>The Daniel Pemberton TV Orchestra - "Leaders of Men"</li><li>The Daniel Pemberton TV Orchestra - "Rainbow Warrior"</li><li>The Daniel Pemberton TV Orchestra - "Rock the Jungle"</li><li>The Daniel Pemberton TV Orchestra - "The Appliance of Science"</li><li>The Daniel Pemberton TV Orchestra - "Tricky Business"</li><li>DJ Krush - "Song 2"</li><li>The Go!

This is good for<a data-ref-id="3045-35" href="/playstation-3/3045-35/" slug="playstation-3">     PlayStation 3</a> owners who only have one controller and wish to play multiplayer with their friends and family.<br/><br/><h3>Challenge mode</h3>A single player mode where you compete to unlock more players, clothes and balls. There are three different types of challenges: Head 2 Head, Tournament and Trick Shots.  <br/> <br/><ul class="plain-list"><li>In Head 2 Head you compete against another bowler and unlock the competitor if you win.  </li></ul> <br/><ul class="plain-list"><li>Tournament is a bowling tournament against AI opponents, if you win you can unlock items.  </li></ul> <br/><ul class="plain-list"><li>Trick Shots is the final challenge mode where you have to participate in objective type bowling games; such as bowling around items and over ramps. </li></ul> <br/>In HVB you utilize the <a data-ref-id="3015-5310" href="/sixaxis-support/3015-5310/" slug="sixaxis-support">    SIXAXIS</a>/<a data-ref-id="3000-29" href="/dualshock-3/3000-29/" slug="dualshock-3">    DualShock 3</a>'s motion sensing abilities to control your character much like the bowling game in <a data-ref-id="3025-930" href="/wii-sports/3025-930/" slug="wii-sports">      Wii Sports</a>.

At its core, the game may seem like a racing game similar to slot cars from a 2D overhead point of view, but the game has more to do with the mission-based driving genre, with all of the different modes available. The game features 16 core gameplay modes; off that number, 12 modes have a variant labeled "Turbo", and four of them also have a variant labeled "Master", which is the harder setting. It features 10 different tracks, all rendered in full 3D.  <br/> </p><h2>Gameplay Modes <br/></h2><ul class="plain-list"><li><b>In the Zone - Other racers have zones marked behind them. Stay within them while maintaining speed until they disappear.<br/></b></li><li><b>Combo Racers - Overtake other racers to build your combo and increase your speed. Overtake the first place car within the time limit. Crashes cancel the combo.<br/></b></li><li><b>Rival Racers - Beat the rivals by picking the best lane and hitting speed boosts.<br/></b></li><li><b>Fireball Frenzy - Once an overtake combo is reached, your car turns into a fireball. Hitting other racers will increase speed.<br/></b></li><li><b>Sunday Drivers - Overtake as many cars as possible. Other cars will move much slower than yours.<br/></b></li><li><b>Speed Monkey - Similar to Combo Racers except that speed will always increase until you crash.<br/></b></li><li><b>Balloon Burst - At the beginning of the race, use the accelerator to inflate your car. Release it when ready to send it flying while you pick the lanes. Distance equals points. <br/></b></li><li><b>Hot Rods - Avoid other cars and use the throttle sparingly to avoid crashes.<br/></b></li><li><b>Escape - Your car is much slower than the blue flames inhabiting the track. Switch lanes to avoid the flames coming in behind you.<br/></b></li><li><b>Death Race - While your car is on fire, hitting other cars will net you points. Once a car has been hit, it will turn into a blue flame. Hit the blue flame and your race is over.<br/></b></li><li><b>Buddy Race - Avoid other cars while maintaining a close proximity to your partner. The closer you two are, the faster your will go, but if one car slows down, the duo does as well.<br/></b></li><li><b>Hot Pursuit - Ram into the target car as much as possible.<br/></b></li><li><b>Sudden Death - Other cars are now missiles which are much slower than you are. Hitting even one missile ends the race, so avoid them. <br/></b></li><li><b>The Munchies - Your speed will constantly drop unless you run into other cars.

People who already bought the first version received this update for free. The game is now with trophies.<br/> <br/>The biggest update was the single-player portion, which was now much much easier. For example, in the original, in order to get a silver cup for an event the player has to score silver or better in both races; if he didn't succeed in one of them, the game takes the worst result as the result of the event. <i>In 2nd Lap</i>, the game now takes the best result in the event. Still, if the player want to acess the very last wave in Solo Tournament, he must have two waves all in gold. <br/> <br/>Another big addition to the game is the Ghost Attack, replacing the Score Attack mode. It is basically the same mode, but players can now download other people's best time as ghosts, and race against them. All of the player's progress in leaderboards is now tracked in a new, global leaderboard called "Driver's Points". <br/> <h2>Multiplayer<br/></h2>Every gameplay mode can be played with up to 8  players, although the multiplayer is local only. In fact, the only  online-based feature the game has are leaderboards, through Ghost Attack.]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>20608</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/0/1570/621317-pixeljunkracers01.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1570/621317-pixeljunkracers01.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/0/1570/621317-pixeljunkracers01.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1570/621317-pixeljunkracers01.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/1570/621317-pixeljunkracers01.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1570/621317-pixeljunkracers01.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/0/1570/621317-pixeljunkracers01.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[PixelJunk Racers]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-6/]]></api_detail_url><id>6</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: E]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2007-09-13 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-88/]]></api_detail_url><id>88</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation Network (PS3)]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-network-ps3/3045-88/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3N]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pixeljunk-racers/3030-20608/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[Wipeout Fury

It also has certain music effects, like fading out or bass augmentation while the player is doing a barrel roll, or jumping over cliffs. Unlike the original PSP game, <i>Wipeout HD</i> also features online race modes over PlayStation Network, a feature that was also in the later PSP game <i>Wipeout Pulse</i>. Also returning from <i>Wipeout Pulse</i> are 'Mag Strips' sections of the track in which the ships are magnetically bound to the track, allowing for gravity defying loops. The brand new online multiplayer comes with voice chat support.</p><p style=""><i>Wipeout HD</i> features motion control of the player's ship using the PS3's Sixaxis controller; PS3's DualShock 3 controller enables the rumble feature. Motion control can be turned either on or off, have its sensitivity adjusted, or be simply used to control the pitch of the vehicle.</p><h2>Development</h2><p style="">Toward the end of it's development cycle, <i>Wipeout HD</i> faced severe delays, with Sony Computer Entertainment Europe President, David Reeves stating, "There is a specific technical problem with Wipeout that we have to solve. I can't go into details but it is a really, really tricky technical problem that no region has been able to solve at the moment." It was later reported and confirmed that the game had failed epilepsy testing and had to be reworked. This was due to the amount of colors and the pulsing race track effect present in Zone mode, which had to be later toned down. When the game was released, it suffered from a bug that caused the game to crash to anyone with over 20 people in their friends list. This has been fixed and new difficulty adjustments have been added as well through patches.</p><p style="">The game was released on September 25, 2008 and cost US$19.99 on the PSN Store.</p><h2>Tracks</h2><ol><li><a data-ref-id="3035-1619" href="/vineta-k/3035-1619/" slug="vineta-k">Vineta K</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3035-1620" href="/anulpha-pass/3035-1620/" slug="anulpha-pass">Anulpha Pass</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3035-1623" href="/moa-therma/3035-1623/" slug="moa-therma">Moa Therma</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3035-1621" href="/chenghou-project/3035-1621/" slug="chenghou-project">Chenghou Project</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3035-1622" href="/metropia/3035-1622/" slug="metropia">Metropia</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3035-1624" href="/sebenco-climb/3035-1624/" slug="sebenco-climb">Sebenco Climb</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3035-1626" href="/ubermall/3035-1626/" slug="ubermall">Ubermall</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3035-1625" href="/sol-2/3035-1625/" slug="sol-2">Sol 2</a></li></ol><p style="">Every track can (with some alterations) be played in reverse; these are unlocked in campaign mode along with the other normal tracks.</p><p style="">Moa Therma and Metropia are from Wipeout Pulse, and the other six are from Wipeout Pure and its expansions.</p><h2>Teams</h2><ul><li>Feisar</li><li>Assegai</li><li>AG-Systems</li><li>Qirex</li><li>Piranha</li><li>Triakis</li><li>Goteki45</li><li>EG-XI</li><li>Icaras</li><li>Mirage</li><li>Harimau</li><li>Auricom</li></ul><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p style="">The original Wipeout (XL or 2097 depending on your region) was credited with bringing a number of underground electronic bands to the fore; including introducing The Prodigy to many people in the United States.

It is a substantial update that offers about as much content as the original game itself<i>.</i></p><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1295/1089765-wipeouthdfury_e309.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1089765" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1295/1089765-wipeouthdfury_e309.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1089765"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1295/1089765-wipeouthdfury_e309.jpg"></a><figcaption>Zone Battle Mode</figcaption></figure><p style="">The expansion introduces a brand new Fury campaign which includes 80 new events. The Fury campaign is more varied than the HD Campaign, as the expansion introduces three new game modes. First is the Eliminator mode, which, true to the name, has you destroy your opponents using the games entire arsenal in order to reach the target score. This mode introduces some changes to the gameplay mechanics. You can no longer absorb power-ups, instead you are granted a temporary shield. The L1 button now does a quick full stop and a 180 degree turn, in order to attack the racers behind you. Overall, the mode is similar to SCE Studio Liverpool's Destruction Derby games. The second new mode is Detonator. This mode is a spin on the Zone mode, only here, the task is to shoot obstacles such as mines and bombs in order to get points. There are 14 stages total in each Detonator event, but it is not necessary to pass them all, as long as enough points are earned. Much like the Zone mode, you take control of a ship specific to the Detonator mode, which is identical for all the teams. It is armed with machine guns, which can be reloaded manually and a shock-wave cannon. The last mode introduced is Zone Battle. The mode is much like regular Zone mode. The main difference is that there are opponents racing on the track. The task is to reach a set amount of zones. By flying over a zone pad, the zone bar is being filled. When its full, the pilot can choose a zone boost or absorb it into energy. When a ship boosts, it leaves a zone barrier which acts much like a mine. Unlike Zone mode, the ships differ from team to team<i>.</i></p><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1295/1089766-3612807865_1964943eba_b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1089766" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1295/1089766-3612807865_1964943eba_b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1089766"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1295/1089766-3612807865_1964943eba_b.jpg"></a><figcaption>The 'Fury' Quirex Ship</figcaption></figure><p style="">Another big feature is that each team now has a new Fury ship. They are a newer generation of the ships available in Wipeout HD. They are arguably much better and slicker looking, not to mention cleaner. Every Fury ship is an improvement over the regular version, performance wise. Fury ships can be identified by their red jet stream. Additionally, each ship has a Zone Battle variation and another skin. Also, there is a Detonator specific ship, which brings the total of new ships to 13.</p><p style="">Fury also introduces 8 new tracks;</p><ul><li>The Amphiseum</li><li>Talon's Junction</li><li>Tech De Ra</li><li>Modesto Heights</li></ul><p style="">and 4 tracks playable exclusively in the Zone, Zone Battle and Detonator game modes;</p><ul><li>Pro Tozo</li><li>Mallavol</li><li>Corridon 12</li><li>Syncopia</li></ul><p style="">Additionally, new 6 music tracks are provided;</p><ul><li>Nosia - <i>Machine Gun</i></li><li>Gingy - <i>Swagger</i></li><li>The Crystal Method - <i>Acetone</i></li><li>The Touch - <i>Le Night Dominator</i></li><li>Spector - <i>Just Hiss</i></li><li>Two Fingers - <i>Marmite</i></li></ul><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1295/1089767-3613273333_20130d6d29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1089767" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.562" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1295/1089767-3613273333_20130d6d29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1089767"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1295/1089767-3613273333_20130d6d29.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1295/1089767-3613273333_20130d6d29.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Detonator Ship</figcaption></figure><p style="">Wipeout HD Fury essentially replaces Wipeout HD, as it it replaces every Wipeout HD logo from the game with Wipeout HD Fury, even in the PlayStation 3's XMB.

The main goal of players is to <a href="/liberation/3015-3676/" data-ref-id="3015-3676">liberate</a> the imprisoned <a href="/viking/3015-1543/" data-ref-id="3015-1543">Viking</a> forces across three different <a href="/island/3035-2801/" data-ref-id="3035-2801">islands</a>. Once players have liberated the forces from the evil <a href="/hel/3005-1886/" data-ref-id="3005-1886">Hel's</a> clutches they can take on that island's main <a href="/fortress/3035-2308/" data-ref-id="3035-2308">fortress</a>, and get closer to Hel's city as they go. The action of Viking is fun, fast paced, and <a href="/extreme-violence/3015-1042/" data-ref-id="3015-1042">bloody</a>. Players can learn a variety of new <a href="/combo/3015-18/" data-ref-id="3015-18">combos</a> that keep the combat fresh and interesting. The games <a href="/stealth/3015-24/" data-ref-id="3015-24">stealth</a> segments though feel extremely half-baked though, and can be frustratingly difficult, so most players will want to start out on the normal difficulty.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Combat in Viking: Battle for Asgard is best described as "cautiously <a href="/button-mashing/3015-44/" data-ref-id="3015-44">button-mashy</a>". The majority of the combat involves tapping the "light attack" button until the enemies are dead. However, there is a <a href="/charge/3015-1060/" data-ref-id="3015-1060">chargeable</a> "heavy attack" that can be used, though its viability is questionable at best. When you cause enough damage to cause one of your opponents to <a href="/dismemberment/3015-2417/" data-ref-id="3015-2417">lose a limb</a>, you will receive a button prompt for a <a href="/finishing-move/3015-21/" data-ref-id="3015-21">finisher move</a>, which will automatically kill the enemy in a gruesome fashion. Special attacks (which expend Rage) and new combos can be learned throughout the game at "arenas" if the player is willing to fork over the gold. <a href="/dodge/3015-2476/" data-ref-id="3015-2476">Dodging</a>, <a href="/special-counterattack/3015-4397/" data-ref-id="3015-4397">countering</a>, stealth kills, and jump attacks can be learned in this way. <a href="/throwing-axe/3055-3433/" data-ref-id="3055-3433">Throwing axes</a> and <a href="/explosives/3055-91/" data-ref-id="3055-91">firebombs</a> can also be purchased through the course of the game. While the game likes to showcase the offensive combat, defense is just as important. The player will become increasingly familiar with the block button and the "defensive bash" technique (which temporarily imbalances or stuns enemies) as the game progresses and it will become apparent that the player is not capable of simply slicing through a large numbers of enemies on his own, unlike in many other <a href="/hack-and-slash/3015-469/" data-ref-id="3015-469">hack 'n' slash</a> games.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The Rage system appears in the game when the player learns a move that requires Rage in order to execute. Rage is shown in the form of 5 emblems near the player's health bar. Each Rage move costs 1-3 units of Rage in order to execute. Rage is regained by landing normal blows on enemies.</p><h2>Game Structure</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Viking: Battle for Asgard is divided into three distinct, <a href="/open-world/3015-207/" data-ref-id="3015-207">open-world</a> islands (it may be important to note that one can not travel between these islands at will). While the islands offer slightly different surroundings and enemies, the same basic tasks must be performed on each island in order to progress.</p><h3>Warrior Liberation</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Throughout the island, the player will find fellow warriors held captive by enemies. The player need only kill the enemies in the immediate area and untie/free the captive warriors (though, it is not necessary for the tasks to be done in this order. If one successfully frees the warriors before all enemies are dead, the warriors will track down the stragglers and take care of them themselves). As soon as the warriors are freed and the enemies in the area are dead, the weather will turn from dark and rainy to bright and sunny. The game requires a certain number of liberations to occur before it allows you to progress.</p><h3>Landmark/Resource Reclamation</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">This is very similar to Warrior Liberation, only a new weapon/resource will usually become available upon completion.</p><h3>Dragon Summons</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Some of your biggest allies in the end-of-island battles will be your <a href="/dragons/3015-551/" data-ref-id="3015-551">dragons</a>. The player will summon one dragon per island and, once the player summons them, they will be available for assistance for the rest of the game (Though only in Stronghold Battles). Dragons can be summoned at "Summon Stones" (Landmarks that look very similar to the game's Arenas) once the player has collected the Dragon's emblem, which is usually located in a chest in an enemy camp or stronghold. When in Stronghold Battles, the Dragons can be summoned to destroy certain targets at the cost of Dragon Orbs. Dragon Orbs can be earned through killing certain targets on your own, and one can hold at most 3.</p><h3>Stealth</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The game forces the player to sneak through enemy Strongholds in order to either destroy a certain building or reclaim a piece of a Dragon emblem.</p><h3>Stronghold Battles</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Stronghold Battles are the climax of each island. They are massive conflicts with the player's army vs. the Legion army. The typical goals for progression in these battles are the elimination of certain targets, usually enemy Shaman, who will continually spawn enemies. Elimination of Shaman can either be done manually or through the use of Dragons. Once the player kills (usually) 2 Shaman (usually) 3-4 times, the player needs to capture a certain waypoint, then they get to face the Stronghold Champion in a one-on-one battle. Once the Stronghold Champion is defeated, the Stronghold is cleared, and (usually) so is the island. The progression to the next island is automatic once all Strongholds on the current island are captured.</p><h3 style="margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;">Orbs</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Fighting enemies gains Skaren three different orb types.</p><ol><li>Reb Orbs: these fill Skaren's power bar, which can be used to activate his rune magic (ice, lightning, and fire). Rune magic operates as an AOE buff for all surrounding allies. Skaren may also directly attack an enemy while this is active, but with the trade off that the Power Bar is depleted much quicker. Killing enemies while Skaren's rune magic is activated will result in more red orbs and stem its depletion. Rune magic may not be turned off once it is activated.</li><li>White Orbs: these can be exchanged for use of Rage Mode attacks.</li><li>Green Orbs: these heal Skaren.</li></ol><h2>Achievements</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Viking: Battle for Asgard is fairly generous with its <a href="/achievements/3015-29/" data-ref-id="3015-29">achievement</a> structure. If the player chooses to play through on the Hard difficulty, all 1000 GS points can be earned in approximately 10 hours. The only miss-able achievements are the Skullbagger achievements, where the player is required to find 4-6 skulls in each Stronghold while sneaking through.</p><h2>PC System Requirements</h2><h3 style="margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;">Minimum</h3><ul><li><strong>OS:</strong>Windows XP Service Pack 2, Windows Vista, Windows 7</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong>Intel Core 2 Duo 2.2 GHz or AMD Athlon™ 64 X2 3800 or better</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong>2 GB RAM</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong>GeForce 8600 GS, Radeon 3400 or better</li><li><strong>DirectX®:</strong>9.0c</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong>6 GB HD space</li><li><strong>Sound:</strong>Direct X 9.0c compatible sound card and drivers</li><li><strong>Additional:</strong>Keyboard, mouse, optional controller</li></ul><h3 style="margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;">Recommended</h3><ul><li><strong>OS:</strong>Windows XP Service Pack 2, Windows Vista, Windows 7</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong>Intel Core 2 Duo 2.6 GHz or AMD Athlon 64 X2 4400 or better</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong>4 GB RAM</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong>GeForce 9400 GT, Radeon 4350 or better</li><li><strong>DirectX®:</strong>9.0c</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong>6 GB HD space</li><li><strong>Sound:</strong>Direct X 9.0c compatible sound card and drivers</li><li><strong>Additional:</strong>Keyboard, mouse, optional controller</li></ul>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>20621</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/1/14036/824161-asgard1_cover.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14036/824161-asgard1_cover.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/1/14036/824161-asgard1_cover.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14036/824161-asgard1_cover.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/14036/824161-asgard1_cover.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/14036/824161-asgard1_cover.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/1/14036/824161-asgard1_cover.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Viking: Battle for Asgard]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>7</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-17/]]></api_detail_url><id>17</id><name><![CDATA[BBFC: 18]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-16/]]></api_detail_url><id>16</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: M]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-24/]]></api_detail_url><id>24</id><name><![CDATA[CERO: 18+]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-12/]]></api_detail_url><id>12</id><name><![CDATA[OFLC: MA15+]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2008-03-25 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-86/]]></api_detail_url><id>86</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360 Games Store]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360-games-store/3045-86/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[XBGS]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/viking-battle-for-asgard/3030-20621/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed - Ultimate Sith Edition

The game begins with Vader's initial contact with Starkiller as a child and then picks up again when he is now a young man serving under Vader, hunting for rogue Jedi that fled the order after the Emperor executed the order 66 which killed most <a data-ref-id="3015-655" href="/the-jedi/3015-655/">                               Jedi</a> members. As the story advances, the formation of the <a data-ref-id="3015-1006" href="/rebel-alliance/3015-1006/">                                 Rebel Alliance</a> is depicted, interwoven with Starkiller's tale and adds back-story to the events in Episode IV.<br /><br />A demo for the game was released on August 21st, for both <a data-ref-id="3015-1404" href="/xbox-live/3015-1404/">                              Xbox Live </a>and the <a data-ref-id="3015-2623" href="/playstation-network/3015-2623/">                             P.S.N.</a>, and the full game was released on September 16th in North America, the 18th in Japan, and the 19th in Europe and Australia. In its first month on the market, the game sold over 1.1 million units across all releases.<br />On July 24th, at Comic-Con 2009, Lucasarts announced a re-release of Star Wars: The Force Unleashed called The Ultimate Sith Edition. This edition will include the original game and a new piece of <a data-ref-id="3015-329" href="/downloadable-content/3015-329/">                            downloadable content</a> also announced at the conference (see the Downloadable Content section). This edition will also include an exclusive additional map to substantiate the story even further. The Ultimate Sith Edition is planned for release in the holiday season of 2009 on both PS3 and 360 and for the first time on <a data-ref-id="3045-94" href="/pc/3045-94/">                           PC</a> and <a data-ref-id="3045-17" href="/mac/3045-17/">                          Mac</a>.<br /><br /><h2>Gameplay<br /></h2>The development team's initial goal was "kicking ass with the Force" resulting in a strong emphasis on those powers associated with it. As one example, the player can grab <a data-ref-id="3055-675" href="/tie-fighter/3055-675/">                         TIE Fighters</a> from the sky and hurl them at his opponents. Each console release was developed with its own unique feel in mind. The <a data-ref-id="3045-20" href="/xbox-360/3045-20/">                        Xbox 360</a> and <a data-ref-id="3045-35" href="/playstation-3/3045-35/">                       PlayStation 3</a> versions of the game are considered the lead releases and feature numerous pieces of advanced technology that simulate character movement and material physics.  These versions allow enemies to intelligently grasp onto ledges while falling and let the player realistically damage surfaces like metal, glass, and wood, although the implementation of these technologies is somewhat sparse, especially with Digital Molecular Matter, the materials simulation. The <a data-ref-id="3045-36" href="/wii/3045-36/">                      Wii</a> version has the Wii Remote control the <a data-ref-id="3055-70" href="/lightsaber/3055-70/">                                 lightsaber</a>, while the Nunchuk deals with Force abilities. Also unique to the Wii is a two-player duel mode with multiple selectable characters from the Star Wars universe including <a data-ref-id="3005-1062" href="/luke-skywalker/3005-1062/">                                 Luke Skywalker</a> himself. The <a data-ref-id="3045-18" href="/psp/3045-18/">                     PSP</a> version lets the player relive historic battles from the films and will include a four-player versus mode. Also, the Wii, <a data-ref-id="3045-19" href="/playstation-2/3045-19/">                    PlayStation 2</a>, and PSP games lets the player take on Jedi trials.<br /><br /><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2352/301174-sw_force_un_360_014.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-301174" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2352/301174-sw_force_un_360_014.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-301174"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2352/301174-sw_force_un_360_014.jpg"></a><figcaption>Decisions, Decisions... </figcaption></figure>Starkiller, while under the employment of Vader, is directed to leave no witnesses to his mission, lest the Emperor and his spies discover Vader's secret apprentice. Starkiller utilizes the Force to a degree never before seen in Star Wars media, although the original animated Clone Wars miniseries was close, and was cited as an inspiration by the developer team. Starkiller can tear apart his environment and utterly destroy his enemies to accomplish his objective, although the environments are not entirely destructible, and the entire game is quite linear.<br /><br />Costumes and Lightsabers are customizable, along with a rudimentary upgrade system for Force Powers and Force Talents. Every level comes with a unique costume which can be equipped at any time after that level is beaten. Lightsabers can be customized with both a color crystal and a Power Crystal, which will give the blade different attributes, such as occasionally dealing lightning damage. These Lightsaber crystals are found in holocrons hidden throughout the game.<br /><br /><b>Force Powers</b><br /><ul class="plain-list"><li><i>Force Grip</i> is Starkiller's first ability, a basic telekinesis power, with which he can grab and manipulate objects and enemies in any way he pleases. It is surprisingly satisfying to dangle people over a chasm and then simply let go.<br /></li></ul><ul class="plain-list"><li><i>Force Push </i>is exactly what you'd imagine it to be: it pushes stuff away from you. It's not very effective on inanimate objects, but if used against enemies it can send them flying away violently dozens of feet, likely killing them if they hit a wall forcefully enough or fall into an abyss.</li> <li><i>Force Lightning</i>, the signature <a data-ref-id="3015-1407" href="/sith/3015-1407/">                   Sith</a> ability, is obvious as well. Starkiller can stun and damage enemies by hitting them with bolts of electricity emanating from his fingertips. It is a highly effective offensive power, though it can also be used to either fry or reanimate electronic machinery.</li> <li><i>Saber Throw</i> is another highly damaging power. If Starkiller is holding an enemy with Force Grip, he can opt to throw his lightsaber at the defenseless target, impaling him upon impact. A nice bonus is that the lightsaber will also greatly damage all enemies unlucky enough to be in the path of its arc.</li> <li><i>Force Repulse</i>, one of Starkiller's signature moves, is a more defensive power, although it can be applied offensively as well. Starkiller expels the Force from within his body in every direction simultaneously, creating a rapidly-expanding "bubble" that knocks away all enemies close to him. It is a great power to use when he is surrounded, or when he finds himself on a bridge of some kind, as that allows him to push off multiple enemies with a single attack.</li> <li><i>Lightning Shield </i>is actually a "stat-boosting" power. In effect, it makes Starkiller tougher, so that attacks will damage him less. At the same time, it will up the damage output of every lightsaber swing he deals out to enemies.<br /></li></ul><h2>Development <br /></h2>Before <i>The Force Unleashed</i> reached its final state, various early ideas for the game cast the player as a <a data-ref-id="3015-1440" href="/wookies/3015-1440/">                                 Wookiee</a>, a <a data-ref-id="3015-6234" href="/bounty-hunter/3015-6234/">                  bounty hunter</a>, a <a data-ref-id="3015-4271" href="/smuggler/3015-4271/">                 smuggler</a>, <a data-ref-id="3005-1008" href="/darth-maul/3005-1008/">                                 Darth Maul</a> (who makes an appearance in the game in the form of a hologram generated by <a data-ref-id="3005-2976" href="/proxy/3005-2976/">                PR0XY</a>), or "the last Skywalker". In April 2005, the development team received word from <a data-ref-id="3040-2292" href="/george-lucas/3040-2292/">                                 George Lucas</a> mentioning the idea of Darth Vader having a secret apprentice, and asked them to see if they could tie the two <i>Star Wars</i> film trilogies together. A PC version was said to not be in production because the game would be too specs-intensive for the average PC, according to <a data-ref-id="3010-644" href="/lucasarts-entertainment-company-llc/3010-644/">               Lucasarts</a>. This changed when Lucasarts announced that the <i>Ultimate Sith Edition</i> would becoming to PC and Mac alongside its console release.<br /><br /><h2>Downloadable Content <br /></h2>Following the official launch of <i>The Force Unleashed</i>, less than a month later an announcement was made about upcoming DLC for the flagship versions of the game, the 360 and PS3 versions. This DLC includes the Jedi Temple level, which is available in the Wii, PS2, and PSP versions of the game at launch, but not the 360 and PS3 versions. This level fits into the storyline shortly before Starkiller's mission to the TIE Fighter Factory, and has Starkiller investigating the Jedi temple to learn more about his past.  Their are two downloadable character skin packs, consisting of classic Star Wars characters and favorites of the development teams. On July 24th, at Comic-Con 2009, Lucasarts announced another piece of downloadable content to be released in the holiday season of 2009 on both PS3 and 360. The new DLC continues the single player story adding where the original game left off.<br /><br />Character Pack # 1  <figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8272/1138260-1090375_use3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1138260" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.896484375" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:89.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8272/1138260-1090375_use3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1138260"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/8272/1138260-1090375_use3.jpg"></a><figcaption>Starkiller in his Sith Stalker armour.</figcaption></figure><ul class="plain-list"><li><a data-ref-id="3005-1062" href="/luke-skywalker/3005-1062/">                                 Luke Skywalker</a></li> <li><a data-ref-id="3005-669" href="/obi-wan-kenobi/3005-669/">                                 Obi-Wan-Kenobi</a></li> <li><a data-ref-id="3005-3788" href="/ki-adi-mundi/3005-3788/">                                 Ki-Adi-Mundi</a></li> <li>Imperial Commando</li> <li><a data-ref-id="3005-308" href="/darth-vader/3005-308/">                                 Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker</a></li> <li><a data-ref-id="3005-9290" href="/kit-fisto/3005-9290/"> </a><a data-ref-id="3005-1878" href="/darth-sion/3005-1878/">                                 Darth Sion</a></li> <li><a data-ref-id="3005-9290" href="/kit-fisto/3005-9290/">                                 Kit Fisto</a></li> <li>Also includes 3 new costumes: Hooded Combat Gear, General Starkiller and Sith Assassin.</li></ul><br />Character Pack # 2<br /><ul class="plain-list"><li>Republic Trooper</li> <li><a data-ref-id="3035-319" href="/tatooine/3035-319/">              Tatooine</a> Luke</li> <li>Ben Kenobi</li> <li><a data-ref-id="3005-11791" href="/plo-koon/3005-11791/">                                 Plo Koon</a></li> <li><a data-ref-id="3005-5119" href="/count-dooku/3005-5119/">                                 Count Dooku</a></li> <li><a data-ref-id="3005-2596" href="/jango-fett/3005-2596/">                                 Jango Fett</a></li> <li><a data-ref-id="3005-4030" href="/c-3po/3005-4030/">             C-3P0</a></li> <li>Also includes 3 new costumes: Utility Combat Suit Apprentice, Animated-style Apprentice, and Spirit Apprentice.</li></ul><br />The game's producer, <a data-ref-id="3040-37814" href="/haden-blackman/3040-37814/">                                 Haden Blackman</a>, has stated that the team is exploring other DLC options beyond what has been announced.<br /><br /><br /><h3>PC Gaming Alliance Criticism</h3>LucasArts came under fire from the PC Gaming Alliance, more specifically, president Randy Stude in October 2008, due to the lack of a PC release for <i>Star Wars: The Force Unleashed</i>. LucasArts has stated that the reason was that they didn't want to release a game on the PC that some users would only be able to run on sub-par settings. Stude attacked Lucas Arts' reasoning saying:<br /><blockquote> <p style="">"That's not an educated answer. In the last several years there have been at least 100 million PCs sold that have the capabilities or better of an Xbox 360. It's ridiculous to say that there's not enough audience for that game potentially and that it falls into this enthusiast extreme category when ported over to the PC. That's an uneducated response."</p></blockquote><br />Stude went on to further attack the quality of LucasArts' games:<br /><blockquote> <p style="">"LucasArts hasn't made a good PC game in a long time," he said. "That's my opinion. They make some pretty good games for the Wii, you know those little sticks you wave in the air, that seems like a natural fit for a lightsaber game, sure. But I think the last good PC game they made was probably Jedi Knight 2, and even their strategy games weren't that great. So I can understand why they would make that call."</p></blockquote><br /><h2>Technology</h2> <h3>Euphoria </h3>The game makes use of the <a data-ref-id="3015-704" href="/euphoria-physics/3015-704/">                                 Euphoria Engine</a> from <a href="http://www.naturalmotion.com/" rel="nofollow">                                 NaturalMotion</a> that was recently highlighted in <a data-ref-id="3030-20457" href="/grand-theft-auto-iv/3030-20457/">                                 Grand Theft Auto IV</a>.  In place of canned animations programmed in response to scripted events, NPCs will react to force powers with some of the most intelligent responses ever designed. Stormtroopers will grab on to anything they can when flung by the protagonist's power, even each other. They will dodge, fall down, get back up, throw up their arms to shield themselves, and give some real credence to the term artificial intelligence. Examples of this technology can be found here:<a href="http://www.naturalmotion.com/euphoria.htm" rel="nofollow"> </a><a href="http://www.naturalmotion.com/euphoria.htm" rel="nofollow">                                 http://www.naturalmotion.com/euphoria.htm</a><br /><br /><h3><a data-ref-id="3015-502" href="/havok-physics/3015-502/"> <b>           Havok</b></a><br /></h3>Used in many games, Havok offers a better ridged structure to characters and objects. The term <a data-ref-id="3015-118" href="/ragdoll-physics/3015-118/">                                 ragdoll physics </a>is used to refer to how a character impacts and reacts to objects which offers more realistic body movements as well as more solid feel to objects and more accurate behavior.<br /><br /><h3><a data-ref-id="3015-3664" href="/digital-molecular-matter/3015-3664/"> <b>          Digital Molecular Matter</b></a><br /></h3>A middleware physics engine created by <a href="http://www.pixeluxentertainment.com/" rel="nofollow">                                 Pixelux</a>. Similar to Havok, DMM offers more realistic behaviors to objects and is moreover used in object reactions from damage to an object such as splintering of wood to how foliage reacts to objects that interact with it. While Havok is used more for character model behaviors, DMM is used more in the world and environment behavior and in <i>Star Wars: The Force Unleashed</i>, these two have been combined to facilitate the heavy use of the force powers in the game. Although it is indeed present on some in-game objects, the majority of the geometry is not Digital Molecular Matter enabled, and is instead just static polygons that do not react.<br /><br />In the past other video games have either used a Havok based system or Euphoria and manually filled in the blanks the two have individually, though in the case of <i>The Force Unleashed</i>, both are combined to offer realistic behavior and realistic structure to the models of the game which, when combined with DMM characters can be clinging on to each other as they smash through glass and objects in a more realistic way.<br /><br /><h2>Plot (spoilers)<br /></h2> <figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9532/288134-screenshot_197594.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-288134" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.4421568627451" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:44.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9532/288134-screenshot_197594.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-288134"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9532/288134-screenshot_197594.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9532/288134-screenshot_197594.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Darth Vader</figcaption></figure>The plot has been kept tightly under wraps during development, although certain details had been announced to the media at E3 2008 along with hints given through a series of video diaries released on the Internet as well as Xbox Live Marketplace. At the start of the game as part of an interactive tutorial designed to acclimate the player to the basic controls, the player takes the role of <u>Darth Vader</u> as he hunts down one of the last Jedi masters who has fled to the Wookie homeworld of  <a data-ref-id="3035-252" href="/kashyyyk/3035-252/">                                 Kashyyyk</a>. A battle erupts and as Vader is about to deliver the killing blow with his lightsaber, it is suddenly snatched away from his hand. Previously, Vader had sensed a presence that was very powerful in the Force and now discovers that it is the small child that now holds his lightsaber. Vader casually kills the Jedi, who is actually the child's father using the Force and plots to make his son his secret apprentice after killing the Imperials that happen to stumble upon the scene to protect his secret.<br /><br />The story jumps and a decade or so later, the child has now grown into a young man trained by Vader in the ways of the Force, showing exceptional ability and is codenamed Starkiller as he pursues his master's agenda throughout the galaxy. His first real assignment against the Jedi is to kill a Jedi Master, General Rahm Kota,  who is in the midst of sabotaging a Tie Fighter production facility in the hopes of drawing Vader out instead. In order to ensure that his secret remains safe, Vader instructs his apprentice to kill anyone he encounters such as the Stormtroopers that he would have otherwise expected to be his allies. <br /><br />The player is also ferried about the galaxy on a prototype ship equipped with a cloak, the Rogue Shadow, piloted by the young and beautiful <a data-ref-id="3005-1779" href="/juno-eclipse/3005-1779/">        Juno Eclipse</a>. She also serves as Starkiller's main love interest in the title and eventually questions his motives for pursuing Vader's secret plan. Another key character is a droid named Proxy who also serves as Starkiller's trainer as he has been programmed with holographic technology and the skills necessary to impersonate a variety of deadly foes in order to try his best to kill his master. In addition, characters like <a data-ref-id="3005-4673" href="/princess-leia-organa-solo/3005-4673/">          Leia</a> and Bail Organa will play important roles as the game covers the formation of the  Rebel Alliance.<br /><br />After the apprentice completes these missions and returns to Vader, he is informed that the Emperor's spies have seen him in action and Vader is forced to kill him before the Emperor in order to prove his loyalty. However, it is a ruse as Vader later "rebuilds" Starkiller and readies him for his true mission: destroying the Emperor. In order to draw the Emperor's suspicion away from Vader and to distract his forces, Vader tasks Starkiller to form an army to oppose the Emperor. <a data-ref-id="3005-2978" href="/rahm-kota/3005-2978/">       Rahm Kota</a>, who he had thought dead due to his fall from the orbital platform where they had first dueled, is still alive and Starkiller finds him on Bespin, convincing him to join him despite his blindness and aid in building the Alliance. Eventually, Starkiller manages to bring together the other founding members of the Rebel Alliance and begins to feel empathy for their struggle as their goals coincide with his mission against the Emperor. After destroying an Imperial shipyard responsible for the construction of Star Destroyers in order to convince the founding members of the Rebel Alliance that it is possible to stand up against the Emperor, they secretly convene on a snow covered world and wish to name Starkiller as the leader of the Alliance. <br /><br />It is in that moment that Starkiller is betrayed by Vader whom he had expected to leave him to fulfill his plan with the newly formed Alliance with whom he now feels some companionship. Arriving with a fleet of Star Destroyers, Vader congratulates Starkiller as he places the rebel leaders under arrest. In anger, Starkiller asks why he is doing this when this would have been their best chance to destroy the Emperor to which Vader replies: "Not with you", before being Force thrown to the edge of a cliff. Before Vader can kill him, he is saved by Proxy when he attacks Vader as Obi-Wan Kenobi. After having easily dispatched Proxy, Vader turns around to find that Starkiller has escaped him.<br /><br />Starkiller is rescued by Juno Eclipse and he vows revenge against Vader for his betrayal at which point Juno Eclipse pointedly tells him that he has to make a decision of his own as to whether he should finish what he has started with the Rebel Alliance or flee. He decides to confront Vader and rescue the rebel leaders. In a vision, he sees a sphere, a humongous space-station. Upon arriving at the Death Star, which was still under construction at the time, Juno finally lets herself go and kisses Starkiller. After that, he takes a leap of faith and starts fighting his way towards the emperor. His search even takes him through the laser-focusing tubes, which would later be the cause of great pain for the rebels in Episode VI. He eventually finds his way to the imperial throne room, where the emperor is threatening to torture and kill the other rebels. However, he is confronted by Vader first. He bests his former master, severely damaging him, but gets distracted when he sees Kota attacking the emperor. The blind Jedi is no match for <a data-ref-id="3005-2459" href="/emperor-palpatine/3005-2459/">      Sidious</a>, and Bail Organa implores Starkiller to help him.<br /><br />At this point, the player can make a moral choice, which alters the ending.<br /><br /><h3>Good Ending<br /></h3>This ending is considered the canonical ending as it is also the ending that appears in the graphic novel adaptation of the story. In this ending, Starkiller manages to defeat the Emperor. Before delivering the final blow, Rahm Kota urges him against giving into his hate. Starkiller considers his words and stays his hand despite the Emperor's goading. It is at that point that the Emperor's guards storm into the chamber and the Emperor himself stands up as if unfazed by the previous battle and attempts to kill the rebel leaders. Starkiller defends them and yells for them to escape as he locks Force powers with the Emperor. The rebels make their escape thanks to Juno Eclipse and an explosion of Force energy fills the chamber. In the end, Vader walks over to the corpse of Starkiller and announces that he is dead. The Emperor does not see this as a victory, however, knowing that Starkiller has become far more powerful than they had wished for him to be and that his death will also serve as a rallying cry to the Alliance. He tasks Vader with hunting down the rebel leaders and exterminating them at all cost lest what they have "unwittingly created" will become their undoing.<br /><br />Juno Eclipse is back on Kashyyyk along with the other founding members of the Alliance where they formally declare their rebellion and choose a symbol to represent themselves, the very symbol that had been seen at the start of the game on a flag hung outside of the hut where Vader had cornered the Jedi Master who was Starkiller's father. Rahm Kota stands with Juno as she looks up at the night sky and wonders about Starkiller and why Kota had trusted him if he knew it was him despite his blindness. Kota replies that he knew that there was hope because he could feel that Starkiller held onto the one thing that enabled him to redeem himself: her. <br /><br />The traditional Star Wars theme plays during the end credits if this ending is taken.<br /><br /><h3>Evil Ending<br /></h3>This ending is not considered the canonical ending. In this ending, the player chooses revenge by choosing to fight Darth Vader's shredded self. Despite his injuries, Vader continues to fight using everything at his disposal. Starkiller eventually kills him and snatches Vader's lightsaber, impaling him through the back and the chest with it and his own, killing Anakin Skywalker. The Emperor compliments him on his success and tells him that Vader was only a "shell" of what he once was and that Starkiller deserves to stand at his side. To prove his loyalty, he tells Starkiller to kill Rahm Kota who had attempted earlier to stand up to the Emperor. Pretending that he is about to decapitate him, Starkiller raises his lightsaber only to turn it against the Emperor at the last second. Expecting this, the Emperor blocks him, and hurls him away with the Force. Juno Eclipse in the Rogue Shadow appears outside the dome to rescue him and the rebels. The Emperor uses the Force to bring the Rogue Shadow down and through the dome, apparently crushing Starkiller and killing everyone else. <br /><br />After this, a scene of Starkiller on an operating table is shown, very similar to the table where Darth Vader was made in Episode III. Starkiller is covered in a mask with a T-shaped visor, and parts of him are clearly mechanical.  The Emperor tells Starkiller how he had to potential to replace Vader, but now he was just as broken and crippled as Vader. Palpatine says he will use Starkiller until a stronger person comes along, then Starkiller will die. The scene ends with a shot from inside Starkiller's helmet, as a medical droid stabs a needle into his eye.<br /><br />The Emperor's theme plays during the end credits if this ending is taken.<br /><br /><h2>Trivia</h2> <ul class="plain-list"><li>Vader's secret apprentice is also a guest character in <a data-ref-id="3030-20678" href="/soul-calibur-iv/3030-20678/">                                 Soul Calibur IV</a> along with Yoda and Vader.</li> <li>The name "Starkiller" was George Lucas' originally planned last name for franchise hero, Luke Skywalker. </li> <li>In <a data-ref-id="3005-8959" href="/ozzik-sturn/3005-8959/">     Ozzik Sturn</a>'s trophy room on Imperial Kashyyyk, you can see the heads of the animals from the Attack of the Clones arena scene, as well as <a data-ref-id="3005-2394" href="/jar-jar-binks/3005-2394/">    Jar-Jar</a> frozen in carbonite, the sewer creature from a New Hope, Mynocks from Empire Strikes back, and a Krayt Dragon head.</li></ul><br /><h2>Easter Eggs</h2> <figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10659/589791-force_unleashed_easter_egg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-589791" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.66806722689076" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:66.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10659/589791-force_unleashed_easter_egg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-589791"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10659/589791-force_unleashed_easter_egg.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10659/589791-force_unleashed_easter_egg.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Star Wars Republic Commando sequel?

Then, after killing all the soldiers, go down the hallway to where there is a section with a ceiling and a wall on the left for seemingly no reason, since there's nothing under there. Then, find 4 boxes to carefully stack right in front of where the roof would be (the ultimate goal here is to get onto the roof) and <a data-ref-id="3015-1" href="/double-jump/3015-1/">                                 double jump</a> onto them.<br /><br />Be sure not to be too close to the boxes when you double jump, because the force of the second jump can sometimes blow the boxes over. Then double jump from there onto the top of the roof, and go as far down as possible. There will be a Clone Trooper's helmet sitting there. This isn't just any Clone however, this is a certain Republic Commando named <a data-ref-id="3005-2738" href="/delta-rc-1138/3005-2738/">                                 Delta 1138</a>.

In order to fully promote this new chapter, a multimedia project was built up around The Force Unleashed, not dissimilar to the one done for <a data-ref-id="3030-12139" href="/star-wars-shadows-of-the-empire/3030-12139/">                                 Shadows of the Empire</a> in the 1990's. With the goal of promoting both the game and the new story events, a book was written by Sean Williams retelling the story of the game, a graphic novel was published, a webstrip related to the story was published, a line of action figures featuring Force Unleashed characters was released, and a tabletop book, The Art and Making of The Force Unleashed was released, which focused on the process of creating the game and telling it's story.<br /><br /><h3>Graphic Novel</h3> <figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14220/624553-14.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-624553" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="1.51640625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:151.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14220/624553-14.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-624553"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14220/624553-14.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14220/624553-14.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>A page from the graphic novel</figcaption></figure>The story of 'The Force Unleashed' was unleashed a month before the actual game hit the shelves.

While trying to track down a witch who is causing a stir in the small town,     Hellboy unravels the inklings of a <a data-ref-id="3015-113" href="/nazis/3015-113/" slug="nazis">                Nazi </a>plot. The game then jumps back and forth between different time periods in the past, as well as present day investigations, all lending themselves to solving the Nazi-caper. The Nazi scheme in question is orchestrated by Hermon von Klempt, a Nazi scientist (who ends up becoming a brain in a jar), and somehow results in many mind-controlled gorillas. <br/>  <br/><h2>Gameplay</h2>The game is your basic beat-em up, with different attacks linked to various face buttons on the controller. You also gain access to Hellboy's gun, which allows for various power ups in the forms of different bullets. There are nine types of <a data-ref-id="3055-533" href="/ammo/3055-533/" slug="ammo">           ammunition</a> in total as certain types only appear in some levels. Most are used for opponents like "Heavy", "Gernade" and "Splinter" ammo, others can be used during the game’s <a data-ref-id="3015-932" href="/puzzles/3015-932/" slug="puzzles">          puzzles</a> like "Ignite" to light beacons or "Release" to destroy vines. Additional types of ammunition like "Charge" can only be obtained by defeating certain enemies with a finishing move.The player punches, bashes, shoots, and pries apart various enemies, ranging from zombies, witches, gnomes, Nazis and Nazi <a data-ref-id="3015-3113" href="/gorilla/3015-3113/" slug="gorilla">         gorillas</a>. In the single player game, the player controls Hellboy, with no option to choose another character. In the co-operative gameplay, the player initiating the game takes control of Hellboy, and player 2 either chooses <a data-ref-id="3005-15940" href="/liz-sherman/3005-15940/" slug="liz-sherman">        Liz Sherman</a> or <a data-ref-id="3005-2432" href="/abraham-sapien/3005-2432/" slug="abraham-sapien">       Abe Sapien</a>. Both Liz and Abe have their own unique move sets. <br/><br/> <h2>Missing Achievements and DLC</h2>On the retail disc, the game only has 840 <a data-ref-id="3015-29" href="/achievements/3015-29/" slug="achievements">      achievement</a> points. In accordance to Microsoft's Achievement Rules, every game is required to have 1,000 points either on the retail disc or via free <a data-ref-id="3015-329" href="/downloadable-content/3015-329/" slug="downloadable-content">     D.L.C.</a>. Likely due to the game's poor sales, <a data-ref-id="3010-87" href="/konami-corporation/3010-87/" slug="konami-corporation">    Konami</a> never released the levels or character necessary to allow for the final 160 points. In the D.L.C., the character Lobster Johnson is playable. In the game manual, the credits show <a data-ref-id="3040-19049" href="/bruce-campbell/3040-19049/" slug="bruce-campbell">   Bruce Campbell</a> (of <a data-ref-id="3025-593" href="/evil-dead/3025-593/" slug="evil-dead">  Evil Dead</a> fame) credited as a secret character. He's stated in various interviews that he voices Lobster Johnson. The four missing achievements are the following:<br/> <ul class="plain-list"> <li>Taste the Lobsters Claw- Complete Chapter 7 - 50G</li> <li>Self Service- Complete Chapter 8 - 50G</li> <li>Pulp Faction- Completed any multiplayer Chapter as Lobster on Xbox Live - 50G</li> <li>Killer Kitsch- Defeated 25 enemies with the Flamingo - 10G</li></ul>The missing achievements have led to various petitions, but to no avail, as Konami hasn't stated any plans or response in regards to releasing the content, given that the game is a sub-par waste of time.]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>20633</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/0/1288/331093-hb2_cover.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1288/331093-hb2_cover.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/0/1288/331093-hb2_cover.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1288/331093-hb2_cover.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/1288/331093-hb2_cover.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1288/331093-hb2_cover.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/0/1288/331093-hb2_cover.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Hellboy: The Science of Evil]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>5</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-1/]]></api_detail_url><id>1</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: T]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2008-06-24 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-18/]]></api_detail_url><id>18</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation Portable]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-portable/3045-18/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PSP]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/hellboy-the-science-of-evil/3030-20633/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20635/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-05-17 23:15:47</date_added><date_last_updated>2011-04-19 17:35:13</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[Konami is getting back into the guitar and drums market with an all-new rhythm game called Rock Revolution.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2> Rock Revolution is a three-player rhythm and music game coming from <a data-ref-id="3010-87" href="/konami-corporation/3010-87/" slug="konami-corporation">              Konami</a>, <a data-ref-id="3010-2085" href="/zoe-mode/3010-2085/" slug="zoe-mode">             Zoe Mode</a>, and <a data-ref-id="3010-1878" href="/hb-studios/3010-1878/" slug="hb-studios">            HB Studios</a>.

It was officially announced on July 11, 2007 and was released in September 2008. Homecoming is the second Silent Hill game to be produced by a Western developer for home console; the first being <a href="../../silent-hill-0rigins/61-14392/" rel="nofollow"> Silent Hill: 0rigins</a> for the <a href="../../sony-computer-entertainment-incorporated/65-995/" rel="nofollow"> Sony</a> <a href="../../psp/60-18/" rel="nofollow"> PSP</a>. It was developed by <a href="../../double-helix-games/65-6585/" rel="nofollow"> Double Helix</a> for the <a href="../../xbox-360/60-20/" rel="nofollow"> Xbox 360</a> and <a href="../../playstation-3/60-35/" rel="nofollow"> PlayStation 3</a>. The <a href="../../pc/60-94/" rel="nofollow"> PC</a> version of Homecoming was released in November 2008 as a <a href="../../steam/92-718/" rel="nofollow"> Steam</a>-exclusive title in North America, with a retail version released three months later in <a href="../../europe/95-289/" rel="nofollow"> Europe</a>.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">Players take the role of <a href="../../alex-shepherd/94-4391/" rel="nofollow"> Alex Shepherd</a>, a <a href="../../special-forces/92-3536/" rel="nofollow"> Special Forces</a> soldier returning to his hometown of <a href="../../shepherds-glen/95-1618/" rel="nofollow"> Shepherd’s Glen</a> after a brief tour of duty overseas -- only to find his father and younger brother Josh missing, and his mother in a coma. Alex begins a search for his brother between his hometown and the fog-covered supernatural town of <a href="../../silent-hill/95-67/" rel="nofollow"> Silent Hill</a>.</p><p style="">The gameplay is focused on a mix of exploration and combat. The player advances through the story by fighting the grotesque monsters that reside in Silent Hill, resolving <a href="../../puzzles/92-932/" rel="nofollow"> puzzles</a>, searching for items and clues, and occasionally selecting responses when branching conversation trees appear during certain encounters in the game.</p><p style="">The game utilizes Alex's military training, in the form of gameplay mechanics such as evasive movement and <a href="../../grapple/92-1622/" rel="nofollow"> grapples</a>. Alex and his enemies also have real-time wounds appear on them as they take damage. Objects in the world have realistic physics, so if Alex bumps into a <a href="../../table/93-282/" rel="nofollow"> table</a>, the table and any objects on it will move and make noise. This sort of carelessness will alert enemies to Alex's location. The game employs new fighting mechanics, including the abilities to dodge enemies and analog swing weapons, greatly improving the combat over other games in the series. Homecoming was also drastically updated in the visual aspect of the game, appropriate since the last console game in the series, <a href="../../silent-hill-4-the-room/61-6328/" rel="nofollow"> Silent Hill 4: The Room</a>, was on the <a href="../../playstation-2/60-19/" rel="nofollow"> PlayStation 2</a>.</p><p style="">In addition, the game has five <a href="../../multiple-endings/92-27/" rel="nofollow"> endings</a> and bonus <a href="../../alternate-costumes/92-583/" rel="nofollow"> costumes</a>.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p style="">After waking from a <a href="../../nightmare/92-3702/" rel="nofollow"> nightmare</a> (which foreshadows the main plot of the game), Alex Shepherd finds himself in his hometown of Shepherd's Glen. He has returned to the town after time in the military. The town he returned to is nothing like the one he remembers though. A strange <a href="../../fog/92-904/" rel="nofollow"> fog</a> has settled over the town and monsters walk the streets. He returns home to find his mother (<a href="/lillian-shepherd/3005-13497/" data-ref-id="3005-13497"> Lillian</a>) in a near-catatonic state. When he questions her about his younger brother <a href="../../joshua-shepherd/94-13498/" rel="nofollow"> Joshua</a> she replies that his father went looking for him and that "he's gone, everyone's gone". Investigating the <a href="../../cemetery/95-1552/" rel="nofollow"> graveyard</a> reveals the Mayor's behaving strangely. He is digging a grave in the cemetery and is unapproachable. Conversation with <a href="/elle-hollaway/3005-7888/" data-ref-id="3005-7888"> Elle Holloway</a> (a childhood friend) reveals that people have gone missing from the town and nothing is how Alex remembers it. After acquiring a firearm from <a href="../../curtis-ackers/94-13502/" rel="nofollow"> Curtis Ackers</a>, Alex goes in search of <a href="../../mayor-bartlett/94-13501/" rel="nofollow"> Mayor Bartlett</a>. Alex enters the Bartlett family tomb and finds a watch with no hands. The ticking of the watch causes Alex to pass out. When he wakes he finds himself in the town of Silent Hill. Entering the Grand Hotel he eventually finds the Mayor in the <a href="../../otherworld/92-6053/" rel="nofollow"> otherworld</a> babbling about his son Joey and how Adam Shepard (the Sheriff and Alex's father) failed to protect the town. Upon being presented with the broken watch the Mayor discards it, inadvertently angering the monstrosity that serves as the game's first boss, a fleshy mass named Sepulcher. Upon defeating the boss Alex falls into the hole Sepulcher creates.</p><p style="">Alex regains consciousness in the Shepherd's Glen prison where he meets <a href="../../deputy-wheeler/94-13499/" rel="nofollow"> Deputy Wheeler</a>. Upon convincing Wheeler of innocence he is released. The police station is then attacked by monsters. Elle then contacts Alex to tell him to meet her. Alex and Wheeler become separated and Alex eventually makes his way to the Parking lot where Elle is waiting for him in a car. They are attacked and escape to the sewers. In the sewers Elle and Alex become separated. Upon emerging Alex goes in search of Dr. Finch as Wheeler advised him to. He finds the doctor covered in blood outside his office. The doctor then runs away and Alex follows. After touching a doll that belongs to <a href="../../scarlet/92-6112/" rel="nofollow"> Scarlet Finch</a> (Dr. Finch's daughter) Alex is transported to the otherworld. Here he begins a descent into a industrial nightmare. Here he finds Dr. Finch shirtless and bleeding from multiple self inflicted lacerations. When confronted by Alex the doctor begins a deranged rant about his daughter. Alex presents the doctor with the doll found earlier. As with the mayor this causes a boss to appear. The games second boss, Scarlet is a giant demonic porcelain doll that kills Dr. Finch and then proceeds to engage Alex in combat. When damaged the porcelain skin breaks and the doll bleeds profusely. This is symbolic and crucial to the games plot. Upon its death Alex sinks into the blood pooling out from the dolls corpse and returns to Shepherd's Glen.</p><p style="">Alex finds himself back in the room that he found the doll as if nothing had happened. The doll lies broken on the floor and Alex finds a key that was hidden in the body of the doll. This key opens a secret chamber in the Town Hall and Alex discovers a cult shrine devoted to deities that are associated with the town of Silent Hill. Alex returns home with this information, searching for clues about his families involvement with the cult. Alex discovers that Joshua was treated specially by his family and that he was ignored for a reason. He finds a letter from his father and a map of Silent Hill. This opens up more questions and Alex questions his mother about Silent Hill. Before she can answer him she is abducted and Alex is beaten and left for dead. He wakes up in a otherworld version of his house and eventually escapes, meeting up with Wheeler and Elle. They take a boat across <a href="../../toluca-lake/95-1391/" rel="nofollow"> Toluca Lake</a>. They are ambushed by cultists and Alex falls into the lake in the scuffle.</p><p style="">Alex is washed up on the lake shore and makes his way into Silent Hill. Along the way he is radioed by Wheeler and is told that both Wheeler and Elle are in the prison. In the prison Alex fights off cultists and finds his mother in a strange torture device. Here the player is forced to make a decision. Lillian begs Alex to kill her quickly before the device kills her slowly and painfully. The player must decided if they can make Alex kill his own mother. Once Lillian dies the prison undergoes a otherworld transition. In the otherworld Alex finds Elle and Wheeler. They find Judge Holloway in the prison as well. She abducts Elle who drops her locket which contains an image of her sister. The game's third boss Asphyxia drags Wheeler through a tunnel and then reappears to fight Alex. Judge Holloway locks Alex in the room, grinning.</p><p style="">With the death of Asphyxia Alex escapes and finds himself in a church. Here he confronts his father twice. Once he finds his father in a confessional booth and has the option to forgive or curse him for his treatment of Alex. The second time they meet Adam is tied up and blocks Alex's progression. He is repentant and through the conversations the player discovers that Alex may not have been in the military at all. <a href="../../adam-shepherd/94-8182/" rel="nofollow"> Adam</a> seems to think that his son was in an insane asylum (referred to as a hospital) before the events of the game. Adam is then killed by <a href="../../pyramid-head/94-2442/" rel="nofollow"> Pyramid Head</a>, the vengeful spirit of Silent Hill.</p><p style="">When Alex proceeds he finds that <a href="../../judge-holloway/94-13496/" rel="nofollow"> Judge Holloway</a> and Curtis are trying to kill him in order to save Shepherd's Glen from the wrath of the gods worshipped by the cult. Alex saves Elle and has the option to save Wheeler from Curtis. Leaving Elle with Wheeler Alex proceeds, determined to find out what happened to Joshua. As he descends he finds a tomb in which the four founding families of Shepherd's Glen have marked the sacrificed children's names. Searching for his families section of the tomb he finds that he was the one meant for sacrifice. This triggers a flashback in which Alex inadvertently kills Josh in an accident on Toluca lake. Having found the truth about what happened to Joshua he faces the final boss. A representation of the fourth ritual sacrifice, death by drowning.</p><p style="">After defeating the boss the player receives one of the five endings for the game. These vary depending on the decisions made in the later stages of the game.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p style="">- All music composed by <a href="../../akira-yamaoka/72-40927/" rel="nofollow"> Akira Yamaoka</a>.</p><p style="">- Vocals on tracks 1, 6, 20, 21 by <a href="../../mary-elizabeth-mcglynn/72-22864/" rel="nofollow"> Mary Elizabeth McGlynn</a></p><p style="">- All lyrics by <a href="../../joe-romersa/72-73904/" rel="nofollow"> Joe Romersa.</a></p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/16944/1230115-shh_promo_ost_front.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1230115" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="1.0143061516452" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:101.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/16944/1230115-shh_promo_ost_front.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1230115"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/16944/1230115-shh_promo_ost_front.jpg"></a><figcaption>Silent Hill: Homecoming OST</figcaption></figure><ol><li>One More Soul To The Call</li><li>Witchcraft</li><li>Mr. JOY</li><li>Cold Blood</li><li>The Terminal Show</li><li>Elle Theme</li><li>4 Pattern</li><li>Snow Flower</li><li>Attitude #70</li><li>Regards</li><li>Total Invasion</li><li>The Real Love</li><li>Voodoo Girl</li><li>Living In Fear</li><li>Dreams of Leaving</li><li>Who Knows</li><li>Slave 2 Death</li><li>The Thing</li><li>Dead Monks</li><li>This Sacred Line</li><li>Alex Theme</li></ol><h2>Trivia</h2><ul><li><a href="../../travis-grady/94-1339/" rel="nofollow"> Travis Grady</a>, the main character in <a href="../../silent-hill-0rigins/61-14392/" rel="nofollow"> Silent Hill: 0rigins</a>, makes a cameo in a cutscene as the truck driver that Alex hitched a ride home from.</li></ul><h2>PC System Requirements</h2><p style=""><b>Minimum System Requirements</b></p><ul><li>OS: Windows XP/Vista</li><li>Processor: Pentium 4 @ 2.8 GHz (3.2 GHz for Vista)</li><li>Memory: 1 GB</li><li>Hard Drive: 10 GB Free</li><li>Video Memory: 256 MB (nVidia GeForce 7800 GT/ATI Radeon X1950)</li><li>Sound Card: DirectX Compatible</li><li>DirectX: 9.0c</li><li>Keyboard &amp;

It was to contain numerous gambling minigames, such as poker, blackjack, and roulette; cheating at these games being a possibility. Players could also hit various nightclubs and pick up extra cash by tending bars or laying down moves on the dance floor.</p><p style="">The citizens of Vegas were to be categorized as suits in a deck of cards: the Diamonds are the high rollers; the Hearts, classic Vegas old-timers; the Clubs, club-goers; and the Spades, the rockers in Vegas. Each of these factions would have given players different missions to complete, unlocking new options in the game.</p><h2>Rumored Cancellation</h2><p style="">On August 24th, 2010, it was reported that "This is Vegas" was been canceled, leaving Midway and Warner Bros $50 million dollars in the hole.</p><p style="">"Apparently the entire This Is Vegas project has been totally canned," said CVG's source.

Gameplay consists largely of three-dimensional platforming mixed with beat-em-up combat.

Throughout the majority of the game, players will take control of <a data-ref-id="3005-2390" href="/po/3005-2390/" slug="po">Po</a>, although they will also control <a data-ref-id="3005-15650" href="/shifu/3005-15650/" slug="shifu">Master Shifu</a> and members of the Furious Five in some levels. Po moves through the levels with basic platforming techniques and fights enemies regularly along the way. In addition to the main goal of the level there will sometimes be simple collection or exploration-related quests in order to achieve 100% completion for the level. Po can upgrade all of his statistics and <a data-ref-id="3015-327" href="/special-attacks/3015-327/" slug="special-attacks">special moves</a> with coins found throughout the level; the player can upgrade him at any point in the pause menu or between levels.</p><p style=""><a data-ref-id="3015-229" href="/bosses/3015-229/" slug="bosses">Bosses</a> and <a data-ref-id="3015-420" href="/mini-boss/3015-420/" slug="mini-boss">mini-bosses</a> are also present; when they appear, they are usually beaten with repeated attacks and/or <a data-ref-id="3015-6" href="/quick-time-event/3015-6/" slug="quick-time-event">quick time events</a>.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style="">The story follows the same basic structure of the film, although it takes many liberties with the film's script in order to provide more enemies to fight.</p><p style="">In the Valley of Peace, a region of ancient <a data-ref-id="3035-343" href="/china/3035-343/" slug="china">China</a> filled with various walking, talking animals, Po is a panda who is largely unsuccessful and unmotivated. His only job is helping his father (who is a goose) with his noodle soup business, a career he doesn't particularly care for. He does, however, dream (and daydream) of becoming a Kung Fu master. One day, he attempts to see a ceremony in which the new Dragon Warrior is crowned; it is expected that one of Master Shifu's elite students, the Furious Five, will become the Dragon Warrior. Po finds that he is late, and he rockets into the ceremony by strapping himself to a set of fireworks; as he lands, he is unexpectedly selected as the Dragon Warrior. Po must train and prove himself to Shifu and the Five while stopping malicious animals from invading the Valley of Peace, and he must also deal with Tai Lung, a former student of Shifu who became too ambitious and aggressive.</p><h2>Multiplayer</h2><p style="">Kung Fu Panda's multi-player pits players against each other in free-for-all brawling similar in style to the <a data-ref-id="3025-318" href="/super-smash-bros/3025-318/" slug="super-smash-bros">Super Smash Bros</a>. or <a data-ref-id="3025-433" href="/power-stone/3025-433/" slug="power-stone">Power Stone</a> games.

One of the key features of <a href="/battlefield-bad-company/3025-1215/" data-ref-id="3025-1215">Bad Company</a> is the completely destructive environment, which is due to the unique <a href="/frostbite-engine/3015-1095/" data-ref-id="3015-1095">Frostbite</a> engine, built specifically for the game by DICE and later incorporated into future entries of the main Battlefield franchise. Battlefield: Bad Company was released for the <a href="/playstation-3/3045-35/" data-ref-id="3045-35">PlayStation 3</a> and <a href="/xbox-360/3045-20/" data-ref-id="3045-20">Xbox 360</a> on June 23, 2008, and unlike its successor Battlefield: Bad Company 2, was never ported to the <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC</a>.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11761-images-screenshots-171738-BFBCmultSCRNpreviewONLINE4ww.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11761" data-size="small" data-ratio="0" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-width="800" style="width: 800px"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/11761-images-screenshots-171738-BFBCmultSCRNpreviewONLINE4ww.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-11761"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/26/11761-images-screenshots-171738-BFBCmultSCRNpreviewONLINE4ww.jpg"></a><figcaption>Destruction</figcaption></figure><p style="">Gameplay in Bad Company is played from a first person perspective, and is built on the Frostbite engine. As the game is played through, players will be encouraged to use destruction to their advantage. The game contains many different weapons, which are classed as ‘Collectibles’. They are weapons that are hidden around different levels, and players are rewarded with achievements for collecting all the weapons. These weapons do not provide much help, as they cannot be selected through the game. They can only be used until they are dropped. Additionally, players are unable to change their weapon loadouts, as you start with a fixed weapon, in the form of the M416 assault rifle. Vehicles can also be used should they be found around the environment. Vehicles available include the staple of US military, in the form of the <a href="/humvee/3055-181/" data-ref-id="3055-181">Humvee</a>, the Russian Vodnik, Abrams, T90 MBT tanks, and other vehicles.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style="">The story to Bad Company is based around four soldiers in the United States army. These soldiers are part of ‘B-Company’. B-Company, or Bad Company as it is known, is a fictional army division full of expendable soldiers. These soldiers are nothing more than cannon fodder, and they are sent in on tasks deemed too dangerous for well known divisions, such as the Rangers. The story opens up with Preston Marlowe, the player character, being transferred to Bad Company. Preston meets up with three other soldiers: <a href="/sergeant-redford/3005-844/" data-ref-id="3005-844">Sergeant Redford</a>, <a href="/terrence-sweetwater/3005-682/" data-ref-id="3005-682">Terrence Sweetwater</a>, and <a href="/george-haggard/3005-854/" data-ref-id="3005-854">George Haggard</a>. These soldiers all have their own reasons and motives for being in Bad Company, and they all have unique personalities which will open up as the player continues through the game. The United States is in a battle with Russia, and need expendable soldiers, leading to the formation of Bad Company.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3344/212915-ea_battlefield_bad_company_4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-212915" data-size="small" data-ratio="0" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-width="560" style="width: 560px"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3344/212915-ea_battlefield_bad_company_4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-212915"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/3344/212915-ea_battlefield_bad_company_4.jpg"></a><figcaption>Sweetwater, Haggard, and Redford</figcaption></figure><p style="">The first mission of Bad Company is called ‘Welcome to Bad Company’, and introduces the player to the game with tutorials. It welcomes players to driving vehicles, shooting accurately, and other such basics of Bad Company. The mission starts with the group being transported through countryside in a transport truck, when their convoy is attacked by a Russian artillery barrage. The truck is extremely badly damaged, and Preston blacks out. When he comes to, the player is introduced to one of the unique features of the game – the ‘Auto Injector’, which automatically refills all health. After this, the game takes the player to another group of Russian artillery cannons, and allows them to use the Russian weapons against the Russians. To begin with, Sweetwater and Haggard overlook the value of Preston, and refer to him as ‘The New Guy’ or ‘Rookie’. They pass on menial tasks, such as searching houses, to Preston for this first mission. After pushing into the Russian controlled area, and pushing them out, they discover something truly worth fighting for….</p><p style="">Sweetwater discovers the dead body of a mercenary in a house. However, there is more to the mercenary than meets the eyes. Sweetwater calls the group over to see the body and is mocked for being so interested in one body. He explains that this is the body of one of the ‘Legionnaires’. The Legionnaires are a secretive mercenary group, that are supposedly the most powerful army in the world. Initially, nobody cares about this mercenary group, but their interest is piqued when Sweetwater reveals that the Legionnaires are always paid with gold. Haggard rushes to the body and searches it, before finding a small nugget of gold. This sets the story in motion.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/68/330454-bfbcmultiscrnwwss6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-330454" data-size="small" data-ratio="0" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-width="960" style="width: 960px"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/68/330454-bfbcmultiscrnwwss6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-330454"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/68/330454-bfbcmultiscrnwwss6.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/68/330454-bfbcmultiscrnwwss6.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Bad Company has lots of explosions like this one</figcaption></figure><p style="">After this, the soldiers are sent out to fight against the Russians again. The fight takes the group through a small town, as well as in a convoy of US tanks. After traveling in one of the US Abrams tanks, Preston is ordered to ride in one of the tanks and protect them from any Russian ambushes as they travel to a Russian-controlled town. In the town, the team are expected to destroy Russian anti-tank weaponry. Once this done, the group follows Russian transport trucks, that are believed to be used by the Legionnaire for transporting gold. These trucks are currently heading over the border into a country called Serdaristan. Haggard is so obsessed with the gold, that he chases the trucks as they travel across the border. This is classed as an invasion of Serdaristan, as he enters while armed. Haggard singlehandedly invades Serdaristan, and owing to the fact that Bad Company chased him in an attempt to stop him crossing the border, they also invaded the country too. They are ordered to explain their reasoning, and are then told that they are now classed as renegade AWOL soldiers. After this, Redford tells the group the army no longer want them, so they’re now going to go after the gold, as ‘they won’t be getting any damned medals now’. Sweetwater enquirers how the group will be organized seeing as Redford is technically no longer the leader of the team. Redford threatens him if he goes further with this inquiry, and Sweetwater backs down, before referring to him as Sarge.</p><p style="">Owing to the fact the group are in a now hostile country, and are now no longer members of any military force, they decide to continue the chase for the gold. The trucks are tracked to a harbor in Serdaristan, and the group decide to attack this port in a hope of stealing as much of the gold as possible. The Serdaristan forces and some of the mercenaries respond to the mini-attack with full force, and the group are forced to fight against an army they didn’t even mean to take on. After pushing into the harbor, the team are stopped by a small platoon of American soldiers. The group are instructed to lay down their arms, and surrender immediately. Haggard takes the opportunity to respond to this with “Oh yeah? You and what army?”, and Sweetwater asks him what he is doing. Haggard explains it’s simply a term he’s wanted to say for a considerable amount of time.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/870/579167-5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-579167" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="800" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 800px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/870/579167-5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-579167"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/870/579167-5.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/870/579167-5.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The squad on patrol</figcaption></figure><p style="">Seeing as the group remain expendable, the United States military send the group deeper into Serdaristan. Seeing as it is a hostile nation at this stage, they might as well let the renegade soldiers continue and potentially cause some good damage, so that they could spearhead a full invasion in the future. The group are sent in a UH-64 Black Hawk to an area near some anti-aircraft weapons, and are order to remove the anti-air. After this, the group enter a nearby golf course to remove any other weapons. After doing this, they move on through the golf course area, which is near the president’s palace. Bad Company decide to storm the palace and see if they could end the war through meeting the president. Fortunately, the president is something of a coward. When Bad Company request an extraction by the US, it is denied as they are renegade soldiers (this was the plan all along – send the team on a suicide mission). However, the Serdar president comes to their rescue, and offers the use of his Mi-24 Hind helicopter, assuming he can be taken from the country as well, as they are beginning to rise against him. Unfortunately, the Hind helicopter is gold, and is far from stealthy. The team are escaping through following the Serdaristan valley, and the president himself says that the Serdar army is “cowardly, though he has tried to improve this by spending vast sums of money on their weapons”.</p><p style="">Sweetwater questions what country they will be passing into, and the president says it is Russia. This is not a good sign considering the fact that the Russian army are hostile to the Americans – regardless of whether they’re AWOL or not. While Preston pilots the plane, he is asked by a member of the team, who asks why there is a black helicopter chasing them. This is one of the mercenary helicopters, and one of the mercenaries aboard the plane manages to nail the <a href="/mil-mi-24-hind/3055-264/" data-ref-id="3055-264">Hind</a> with an RPG.</p><p style="">The plane crashes in the Russian forests, and Preston is unconscious. When he wakes up he discovers that the rest of the team has been separated from him, and the only weapon he has found is the MP-443 Grach pistol. The mission initially starts of in a stealthy manner, but stealth will soon go out of the window. Preston is told to check the large gulag at the top of the mountain. After entering the gulag, Preston finds the rest of his separated team, and the group steal a buggy, before speeding down the mountain and attempting to escape.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1840/236107-battlefield_bad_company.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-236107" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.56216216216216" data-width="740" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 740px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1840/236107-battlefield_bad_company.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-236107"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/1840/236107-battlefield_bad_company.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/1840/236107-battlefield_bad_company.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Not so happy in reality</figcaption></figure><p style="">After doing this, the group passes into a country known as Sadiz. Sadiz is a sandy Middle Eastern country, and is where the Legionnaires are apparently based. The team pass across into the building, and you will see the ship that was discovered during the second mission of the game. The team make their way to the ship, where they find a large warehouse nearby. In this warehouse, the crates of gold are discovered. However, as they enter the building, it is bombarded with bullets from a speeding helicopter gunship. This helicopter is being used by the leader of the Legionnaires, and killing him is vital to get the gold out safely. The Legionnaire leads them onto a large structure stretching into the sea, where he is shot down by Preston, who takes him down with a Carl Gustav rocket launcher. As the group return they are discussing what they plan to buy with their money. Haggard says he wants to buy a Monster Truck, called Truckasaurus Rex. As the group arrive, they discover the US army greedily loading gold onto trucks. The commanding officer believes Bad Company are part of the army, and asks what they are doing. Sweetwater prepares to give an explanation, but Preston quickly says that they are heavily embedded soldiers in enemy territory. Satisfied, the commander sends the men in a truck loaded with, err, ‘scrap metal’. The final scene of the game shows the convoy of trucks driving down a road in Sadiz, and one of the trucks turning off the road onto another sandy trail. Then, Haggard is heard shouting, “Truckasaurus Rex, here I come!”.</p><h2>Campaign Missions</h2><ol><li>Welcome to Bad Company</li><li>Acta Non Verba</li><li>Crossroads</li><li>Par for the Course</li><li>Airforce One</li><li>Crash and Grab</li><li>Ghost Town</li></ol><h2>Multiplayer</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1282489-25357944_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1282489" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.56271981242673" data-width="853" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 853px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1282489-25357944_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1282489"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/3/33529/1282489-25357944_1.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/3/33529/1282489-25357944_1.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Battling on Deconstruction</figcaption></figure><p style="">Bad Company features class-based online multiplayer. The Frostbite engine is carried over from single player into the online version of the game as well. Weapons online are split through four different classes. Different classes have weapons to select from. The game also contains 25 different ranks, which are achieved through earning XP. XP is earned from getting kills, assisting team mates in killing, and other such online actions. For each time that a player ranks up, they receive a Reward Point. This point can be cashed in for a new unlock, which is player selected. There are special weapons for achieving Rank 25, which cannot be unlocked through cashing in points. These weapons are the <a href="/an-94/3055-1321/" data-ref-id="3055-1321">AN-94 Akaban</a>, the <a href="/vss-vintorez/3055-2945/" data-ref-id="3055-2945">VSS Vintorez</a>, the USAS-15, and the <a href="/mg3/3055-1325/" data-ref-id="3055-1325">MG3</a>. There is one exclusive weapon per class, but these weapons are only available through Rank 25, or purchasing the Gold Edition of the game.</p><p style="">Initially, online multiplayer contained only one mode, called Gold Rush. This mode is based around the Russian and American forces, with one team the attackers and one team the defenders. Essentially an <a href="/assault/3015-3294/" data-ref-id="3015-3294">assault</a> game mode, Gold Rush has two gold crates at each base of the defending team. The attackers attempt to infiltrate the bases and place charges on the crate and destroy it. Once both crates are destroyed, the defenders fall back to another base, until they run out of bases to make a stand at. The quantity of bases varies depending on the maps. Both teams have limited spawns, so both teams must use teamwork to win. The attacking and defending teams vary depending on the maps being played, as well as the initial weapon for each class. Some of the maps feature the Sadiz military versus the American army, as opposed to the Russians.</p><p style="">Due to the sheer community demand, Dice released a multiplayer expansion for the game that contains the <a href="/conquest-mode/3015-1099/" data-ref-id="3015-1099">Conquest</a> game mode, and two new maps to play Conquest on. These maps are based on the game campaign.</p><p style="">Bad Company used a special feature called ‘Find All Five’. This was a promotional tool for Bad Company 2, and rewarded players for doing different things around the Battlefield site. Four of the five weapons were for different tasks, but the final weapon, the <a href="/fn-f2000/3055-1322/" data-ref-id="3055-1322">FN F2000</a>, was only available through being a Battlefield Veteran. The Veteran system was implemented with the release of Bad Company, and rewards players for having played previous games in the Battlefield series. This system was used again Battlefield 1943, but did not reward Veterans with any bonuses.

In early 2008, Red Alert 3 was formally announced for a "Red October" release on PC. The Xbox 360 version was released a month later and the PS3 version was on hold until March of 2009.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style="">On the verge of being defeated by the Allies, Soviet leadership executes a desperate plan. The Soviets have secretly build a time machine underneath the Kremlin. Using this time machine, Soviet leaders travel back in time and kill <a data-ref-id="3005-791" href="/albert-einstein/3005-791/" slug="albert-einstein">Albert Einstein</a>, thus removing all the technology that he would have built to help the Allies. Returning to the present, the Soviets are on the verge of conquering all of Europe. However, this time alteration has unwittingly created a new superpower, the Empire of the Rising Sun. Thus the world is plunged into a three way war.</p><p style="">The game features a roughly 10 mission campaign for each faction. The Empire campaign is locked until the player finishes the Soviet and Allied campaigns. There are three possible endings, each putting their respective faction as the victor of the war. The Allies' ending is the canonical one.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">The colorful, campy feel of the Red Alert series will returns in Red Alert 3, ranging from <a data-ref-id="3015-604" href="/full-motion-video/3015-604/" slug="full-motion-video">full-motion video</a> mission briefings and story sequences, as well as outlandish units. New to Command &amp; Conquer is the option for cooperative campaign play. Players can play online with their friend, or choose to play alone, in which case an AI controlled Commander helps out. When playing alone, you can give some generic orders to your co-commander, such as attack specific target. Naval battles play an important role in Red Alert 3, with almost all multiplayer maps featuring large bodies of water for naval units. The game does away with the traditional fields of ore for resources and instead features finite ore mines that only require a single harvester.</p><p style="">The game features three factions, each with differences that dictate how they play. The Allies have unique technologies such as Prism beams and cloaking fields as well as being the air power faction. Soviets focus on brute strength with powerful tanks. The Empire has a strong navy and transforming units. Each faction builds and techs up differently.</p><p style="">The Allies build in the typical CnC style, but buildings will not expand the buildable zone of the base. Tech is upgraded via the MCV or the outpost and all buildings within the build zone will gain the benefits of tech making the Allies very versatile. However teching as the Allies is also the most expensive and time consuming.</p><p style="">Soviets have to immediately place their buildings and let them be constructed in the field. Buildings will increase the build zone however. Tech is upgraded via each production structure and is carried by future structures.</p><p style="">The Empire does away with the tradition CnC build method entirely. Instead the MCV produces mobile building cores which can be moved anywhere on the map before being deployed into buildings, which then take some time to construct. This allows the Empire to build anywhere although the farther away from the MCV, the longer the build time. Tech is cheaper than the other factions but it only applies to that specific production structure. This makes losing a Tier 3 factory very damaging because the Empire must not only rebuild the factory but also re-tech twice, during which time it cannot be used to produce units, to fully replace the loss.</p><p style="">Console editions of Red Alert 3 use a control wheel scheme from the console edition of <a data-ref-id="3030-20494" href="/command-conquer-3-kanes-wrath/3030-20494/" slug="command-conquer-3-kanes-wrath">CnC 3: Kane's Wrath</a> with some slight improvements. Online Co-op matchmaking however is not implemented.</p><h2>Special Editions</h2><p style=""><b>The Premier's Edition</b></p><p style="">The Premier's Edition comes in a tin box, along with five exclusive MP/skirmish maps, a making of DVD feature, a feature entitled "Women of Red Alert 3", a soundtrack, a beta key for Command and Conquer 4 and the "Kossar's Helm" item for Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning.</p><p style="">Complete list of items:</p><ul><li>Collector's tin case</li><li>Five exclusive multiplayer/skirmish maps</li><li>Bonus DVD featuring the following:</li><li>Full-length Raising the Iron Curtain making-of movie with exclusive interviews from the star-studded cast</li><li>Concept art montage video "From Pens to Pixels"</li><li>Bloopers and outtakes from the cinematics sessions</li><li>Women of Red Alert 3 montage video</li><li>An inside look into the future of Command &amp; Conquer and Red Alert</li><li>Tips on how to unlock the secrets of each side, directly from the developers</li><li>Complete video walk-thru on one of the game's most difficult missions</li></ul><ul><li>Game Soundtrack including exclusive remixes of Hell March and Hell March 2 by From First to Last, plus the all-new Hell March 3</li><li>Women of Red Alert 3 Poster</li><li>Exclusive Beta Key to <a data-ref-id="3030-27130" href="/command-conquer-4-tiberian-twilight/3030-27130/" slug="command-conquer-4-tiberian-twilight">Command &amp; Conquer 4</a></li><li>An exclusive in-game item for Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning - Korssar’s Helm [ This magical Kislevite helm is imbued with the spirit of the wild North and will magically transform the wearer into a ferocious bear. ]</li></ul><p style=""><b>PS3 Ultimate Edition</b></p><p style="">EA announced that its Playstation 3 edition of Command &amp; Conquer : Red Alert 3 will contain bonus content due to PLAYSTATION 3’s Blu-ray disc capacity.

Original end date was set to September 26, 2008, but EA extended the beta over the weekend. The beta was open for everyone who had registered their beta key acquired from either the Command &amp; Conquer 3 Limited Collection or the Command &amp; Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath expansion pack by September 15, 2008. The multiplayer beta comprised of four maps, two 2-player maps and two 4-player maps.</p><h2>DRM</h2><p style="">Released right after <a data-ref-id="3030-14139" href="/spore/3030-14139/" slug="spore">Spore</a>, Red Alert 3 also uses the controversial <a data-ref-id="3015-2720" href="/securom/3015-2720/" slug="securom">SecuRom</a> <a data-ref-id="3015-1704" href="/digital-rights-management/3015-1704/" slug="digital-rights-management">DRM</a>. Users must authenticate online are only able to install the game five times. Any additional installs require contact with EA support. Uninstalling the game does not give back an install. Since release, patches have eased the stringent DRM, allowing uninstalls to give back an install and allow players to de-authorize the game. The Red Alert development team has stated that once the popularity of the game wanes and the servers go down, a patch will likely come out to remove the online authentication. The Steam version initially had SecuRom but is now protected through Steam.</p><h2>Expansion Pack</h2><p style="">Red Alert 3's first expansion pack: <a data-ref-id="3030-25034" href="/command-conquer-red-alert-3-uprising/3030-25034/" slug="command-conquer-red-alert-3-uprising">Command &amp; Conquer : Red Alert 3 : Uprising</a> was released on March 13th, 2009. A stand-alone expansion pack, Uprising features no online multiplayer. It adds powerful new units to each faction, four new "mini-campaigns", an all-new Commander's Challenge mode, 30 new Skirmish maps, all-new FMV cutscenes with new actors, and new music tracks.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p style="">C&amp;C veteran composer, <a data-ref-id="3040-1025" href="/frank-klepacki/3040-1025/" slug="frank-klepacki">Frank Klepacki</a>, returned for Red Alert 3 to compose 3 songs, <i>Hell March 3</i>, <i>Grinder 2</i> and <i>The Red Menace</i> aka <i>Nuclear Death</i> aka <i>Soviet Up Yours theme</i>. British composer <a data-ref-id="3040-7990" href="/james-hannigan/3040-7990/" slug="james-hannigan">James Hannigan</a> composed the music of the "Empire of the Rising Sun" faction and the game's Soviet March theme. <a data-ref-id="3040-90639" href="/timothy-michael-wynn/3040-90639/" slug="timothy-michael-wynn">Timothy Michael Wynn</a> composed music for the Allied faction and some tracks for the Soviet faction.</p><h2><b>The Units</b></h2><h3><b>ALLIES</b></h3><h3>INFANTRY</h3><ul><li><h3>Attack Dog:</h3>The Attack Dog acts as an early game scout, it’s fast and can take out enemy infantry in one hit. Their senses allow dogs to detect disguised Spies and Sudden Transports. Its secondary ability allows the dog to roar via an amplifier which stuns enemies.</li><li><h3>Peacekeeper:</h3>The Peacekeeper is the main infantry unit, it carries a combat shotgun which is devastating to infantry at close range. Its secondary ability swaps to a shield, this shield greatly reduces damage but also slows the unit down.</li><li><h3>Engineer:</h3>The Engineer, like in past games can capture neutral or hostile buildings and repair allied buildings. The Engineer can deploy itself into a medical tent to heal allied infantry. Engineers are amphibious.</li></ul><ul><li><h3>Javelin Soldier:</h3>The Javelin soldier is a powerful anti-tank and building unit but it has a long reload time. Its secondary ability locks onto an enemy building or vehicle allowing it to fire faster and deal more damage, although it takes time to lock on.</li></ul><ul><li><h3>Spy:</h3>The Spy has the ability to infiltrate any enemy building. This can give unit information, money, power down their base or other things depending on what building it infiltrates. The Spy can cloak itself to look like an enemy infantry, and also buy off enemy units that are within range for $1000.</li></ul><ul><li><h3>Tanya:</h3>Tanya is the allied commando, she is deadly to infantry. Tanya can also destroy vehicles and buildings by planting a bomb on them. Tanya has a time belt which allows her, when activated, to revert back in time a few seconds to escape danger. Like all commando units, she is amphibious.</li></ul><h3>VEHICLES</h3><ul><li><h3>Multigunner IFV:</h3>The IFV is one of the most versatile units in the game. It can load a single infantry, at which point the IFV's main rocket launcher will convert to an upsized version of the infantry's weapon. Loading a peacekeeper equips the IFV with a powerful shotgun for anti-infantry. Loading engineers allows the IFV to repair allied vehicles and loading dogs will turn allow the IFV to stun infantry. In team games, a teammate's infantry from other factions can be loaded into the IFV creating even more possibilities.</li><li><h3>Guardian Tank:</h3>The Guardian tank is the main battle tank for the Allies. It has a good balance of speed, armor, firepower, and range. Its secondary ability toggles a targeting laser that allows allied units to deal 50% more damage to the designated target.</li></ul><ul><li><h3>Prospector:</h3>The Prospector is the ore collector. Its secondary ability is unpacking into an outpost allowing the Allies more build space.</li></ul><ul><li><h3>Athena Cannon:</h3>The Athena is the Allies' artillery unit that fires a powerful orbital laser on its targets. Its secondary ability is the Athena Shield which projects a large forcefield to soak up damage.</li><li><h3>Mirage Tank:</h3>A combination of Red Alert 2's Mirage and Prism Tanks, the Red Alert 3 Mirage Tank is the most advance tank the Allies can field. The Mirage Tank can camouflage with the environment while stationary to become invisible to enemies and is equipped with a Spectrum-Dispersion Cannon that can bounce off multiple nearby targets. Its secondary ability allows it to cloak other allied units within a short range around it.</li></ul><h3>AIRCRAFT</h3><ul><li><h3>Apollo Fighter:</h3>The Apollo is the Allies air superiority fighter, it is more powerful than its Soviet and Empire equivalents. Its secondary ability allows it to fly at great speed straight back to the airbase via the most direct route. Apollos must land in airbases to resupply ammo.</li></ul><ul><li><h3>Century Bomber:</h3>The Century Bomber; the Allies main bomber aircraft can carpet bomb large areas and can also be loaded with infantry to be parachuted down anywhere. Centuries must land in an airbase to resupply.</li></ul><ul><li><h3>Cryocopter:</h3>The Cryocopter can freeze any unit or building with its main gun--the more health the target has, the longer it takes to freeze. Frozen units and structures will die in one hit from any source. The Cryocopter's secondary ability is the Shrink Ray, which will reduce one target--friendly or enemy--to miniscule proportions for 15 seconds. Shrunken units do significantly less damage while also taking more damage; however, they move much faster.</li><li><h3>Vindicator:</h3>The Vindicator essentially replaces the Harrier Jet from Red Alert 2 as a strike-and-return, pinpoint bomber. Its secondary ability orders it to fly back to base at increased speed along the most direct route. Vindicators must land in an airbase to resupply.</li></ul><h3>NAVAL</h3><ul><li><h3>Riptide ACV</h3>The Riptide ACV is an early Allied amphibious transport unit that can carry 5 infantry units. On water it fires torpedoes while on land it uses a machine gun.</li><li><h3>Dolphin:</h3>The Dolphin is the Allies' fast, water-based scout unit. It attacks via amplified sonar pulses that do linear splash damage. Its secondary ability allows it to briefly jump out of the water to avoid attack or leap over obstacles, but leaves it temporarily vulnerable to anti-air attacks.</li><li><h3>Hydrofoil:</h3>The Hydrofoil is the main Allied anti-air naval unit. It is a very fast unit with dual rapid-firing chainguns that shred aircraft in seconds. Its secondary ability allows it to selectively target and disable the weapons of any nearby enemy non-infantry unit.</li><li><h3>Assault Destroyer:</h3>The Assault Destroyer is the most powerful amphibious unit in the game. In addition to its beefy main cannon, it can activate a blackhole shield draws all nearby enemy fire to it, protecting enveloped allied units from attacks.</li></ul><ul><li><h3>Aircraft Carrier:</h3>The Aircraft Carrier is the main naval siege unit for the Allies. It deploys five powerful drones that bomb ground targets at great distance. While in flight to or from their target, the drones are susceptible to anti-air attacks, and any destroyed drones are automatically replenished by the aircraft carrier after a short time for free. Te carrier's secondary ability fires a Blackout Missile that powers down all enemy units and structures within the area of the point of impact.</li></ul><h3><b>SOVIETS</b></h3><h3>INFANTRY</h3><ul><li><h3>War Bear:</h3>The War Bear acts as an early game scout with the same abilities as the Allied Attack Dog. Though not as fast as the Allied Attack Dog, the Bear has more health.</li><li><h3>Conscript:</h3>The Conscript is the basic Soviet infantry unit. He is lightly effective against all other infantry, and not much else. His secondary ability is to throw a stream of Molotov cocktails which deals small splash damage and can clear out enemy garrisoned buildings.</li><li><h3>Flak Trooper:</h3>The Flak Trooper is the main anti-air and armor unit. Its secondary ability is to throw down a magnetic mine that latches onto enemy vehicles or structures and deals significant damage.</li><li><h3>Combat Engineer:</h3>The Combat Engineer can capture enemy or neutral tech buildings. It is the only engineer to have a weapon - a pistol. Combat Engineers can deploy mini bunkers fit for two infantry. Also can deploy a one-man inflatable raft to allow him to cross water.</li><li><h3>Tesla Trooper:</h3>The Tesla Trooper is a powerful anti-infantry and armor unit with a short charge-up time to its attacks. Its secondary ability emits an area discharge that disables nearby enemy vehicles. It can also charge up friendly Tesla Coils by firing at them and cannot be crushed by enemy vehicles.</li><li><h3>Natasha:</h3>Natasha is the Soviet commando. She has a high powered sniper rifle that can pierce multiple infantry. She can call down paint non-infantry targets with a laser designator to call in airstrikes to destroy vehicles and structures. Her secondary ability is to snipe the pilot from a ground vehicle which can then be commandeered by any friendly infantry, effectively trading that infantry unit for permanent control of the captured vehicle.</li></ul><h3>VEHICLES</h3><ul><li><h3>Terror Drone:</h3>The Terror Drone is a fast, but fragile early harassment unit. It jumps into vehicles and slowly dismantles them from the inside. An infested vehicle can only be purged by being repaired (from any source). The Terror Drone's secondary ability is the Stasis Ray which prevents the targeted vehicle from moving, which can be handy to allow another terror drone to catch up to a fleeing vehicle, for example.</li><li><h3>Sickle:</h3>Inspired by the Terror Drone's spider-like design, the Sickle is a multi-legged crawler, with three machineguns around its body that chew through infantry. Its secondary ability allows the Sickle high through the air and land across chasms, atop cliffs, or right into a pack of enemy infantry, stunning and damaging them all.</li><li><h3>Ore Collector:</h3>The Ore Collector collects ore. Its secondary ability allows it to deploy a shield that greatly reduces damage at the cost of movement speed and its ore-collecting ability.</li><li><h3>Bullfrog:</h3>The Bullfrog is the Soviets' early troop transport; it can only attack air units with its flak cannon, leaving it helpless against enemy ground units. Up to 5 infantry can be loaded into the Bullfrog for transport. The only means of unloading its passengers is for the Bullfrog to launch them into the air with its Mancannon. Each launched infantry unit will then parachute to the ground, all the while being vulnerable to anti-air attacks.</li></ul><ul><li><h3>Sputnik:</h3>This is a Soviet base expansion unit. It can be unpacked into an outpost that gives a build radius.</li><li><h3>Hammer Tank:</h3>The Hammer Tank is the main Soviet battle tank. It is more powerful than the Allies' Guardian with more armor at the expense of speed. Its secondary ability is a Leech Beam allowing it to steadily leach health from enemy vehicles. If the leech beam kills the vehicle, the Hammer Tank gains the weapon of that vehicle. A clever tactic is to use the leech beam on allied vehicles that are about to die. This not only prevents the enemy unit from gaining promotion bonuses, but the Hammer Tank also gains a new weapon.</li><li><h3>V4 Rocket Launcher:</h3>The V4 is the Soviet's artillery unit. The V4 fires long range missiles at targets and is quite effective against most units, assuming they stay still long enough for the slow-moving missiles to connect. Its secondary ability allows it to fire cluster missiles that exchange pinpoint damage for reduced area splash damage.</li></ul><ul><li><h3>Apocalypse Tank:</h3></li></ul><p style="">The Apocalypse Tank is RA3's equivalent to the Mammoth Tank. It is effective against all other armored vehicles. Though slow, the Apocalypse can crush smaller tanks. The Apocalypse's secondary is a Magnetic Harpoon that draws enemy vehicles towards grinders in the tank's front, instantly killing the enemy unit on contact.</p><h3>AIRCRAFT</h3><ul><li><h3>Twinblade:</h3>The Soviets attack helicopter can fire a intermittent barrage of rockets to complement its continuous stream of machine gun fire and can transport up to five infantry units or one vehicle.</li><li><h3>MiG:</h3>The Mig is the Soviet's air superiority fighter. While not as powerful as the Allied Apollo, the MiG deals splash damage, allowing the MiG to come out victorious in large engagements. The secondary ability allows it to fly at a faster rate straight back to the airfield via the most direct route.</li><li><h3>Kirov Airship:</h3>The Kirov's only weakness is its speed. As the slowest unit in the game, it is particularly vulnerable to every form of anti-air. However, should it manage to arrive over a target, that target is all but destroyed as house-sized bombs rain down upon it. The secondary ability allows it to continuously exchange health for movement speed.</li></ul><h3>NAVAL</h3><ul><li><h3>Stingray:</h3>The Stingray is a basic amphibious unit that has a pair of Tesla Coils mounted to its front. It is effective against infantry and lightly armored ships and vehicles. Its secondary ability emits an electrical discharge in the water, damaging every unit around the Stingray and instantly killing biological units like dolphins.</li><li><h3>Akula Sub:</h3>The Akula is the Soviet submersible unit. It is relatively slow, but deals considerable damage. While submerged, the sub can only be attacked by torpedos and advance base defenses. The Akula must surface to attack with its own torpedoes. Its secondary ability fires two unguided Ultra-Torpedoes that deal major damage to anything that fails to get out of their path.</li><li><h3>Dreadnaught:</h3>The Dreadnaught is the Soviet naval siege weapon.

It is published by EA and is the sequel to the game <a data-ref-id="3030-5228" href="/skate/3030-5228/" slug="skate">skate</a>, released in late 2007. The game was released on January 21st, 2009 in North America and January 23rd in all other regions. Like skate, Skate 2 is a realistic take on skateboarding utilizing the flick-it controls. In this control scheme, the player's legs are mapped to face buttons, while their arms are mapped to the shoulder buttons, the board is controlled by flicking motions of the right thumbstick.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6294/456529-s2.gif" data-ref-id="1300-456529" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6294/456529-s2.gif" data-ref-id="1300-456529"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6294/456529-s2.gif"></a><figcaption>Skate 2</figcaption></figure><p style="">Skate 2 takes place five years after the events of the original game. In the time between games, the player has been in jail for attempting to skate down the San Vanelona Dam. Upon being released, he returns to <a data-ref-id="3035-280" href="/san-vanelona/3035-280/" slug="san-vanelona">San Vanelona</a> to find a greatly changed city. A disaster had left the city in ruins allowing for the corporation Mongo Corp. to come in and rebuild it. The newly rebuilt city has been labeled "New San Vanelona" and, as the name suggests, the city has been greatly changed. The newly rebuilt city replaces the suburbs with "The Projects", a high rise residential area with large gaps and air time. An entirely new area has also been added, dubbed "San Van Mountain." This area can be seen in the skybox of Skate 1 and brings downhill gameplay at great speed.</p><p style="">San Vanelona is no longer a skaters paradise, however. The corporation Mongo Corp. hasn't taken kindly to skaters and has done things such as putting caps on many of the cities rails. According to a developer, the goal of the story will no longer be about proving your skill as a skater, as this was accomplished in Skate 1; rather the goal of the story will be about proving your worth as a skater to the community. According to a Gamespy article, the player will need to do challenges that will earn him money so that he can build skate parks and "stick it to the man."</p><h2>New Features</h2><p style="">Skate 2 has a number of new features.</p><ol><li>The player now has the ability to get off of the board. This is done by pressing Y on the 360and triangle on the PS3. Not only does getting off of the board allow for greater freedom and control, but there is also a major gameplay change attached to this mechanic - The player has the ability to interact with the environment by moving objects around. The player may move "anything that doesn't look bolted down." Any item you move will stay where you leave it, as long as it's somewhere it won't interfere with the cities inhabitants, such as in the street.</li><li>The amount of tricks at the players disposal has been doubled. Among the additions are handplants, foot plants, bean plants, and hippie jumps.</li><li>The default camera has been improved, but for those who would prefer a more standard camera, the option has been added.</li><li>The character creator is much more robust, akin to the <a data-ref-id="3025-276" href="/tiger-woods/3025-276/" slug="tiger-woods">Tiger Woods</a> games. Among the improvements is the ability to create a female character.</li><li>The game still takes place in the fictional city of San Vanelona, but the city has been redesigned for a better gameplay experience. The newly rebuilt city replaces the suburbs with The a high rise residential area promising large gaps and air time. An entirely new area has also been added, called "Cougar Mountain." Also added is a Waterfront area, that bears an uncanny resemblance to the cruise liner level in Tony Hawk 4. This part of the map has been seen as less than satisfactory due to its lack of realistic terrain, including a quarterpipe in the wall of a cruise ship.</li><li>An improved session marker system. Session markers no longer trigger a load screen if the player is close to the selected area.</li><li>The game also sports reduced load times as well as 60 frames per second on both the 360 and PS3. The frame rate tends to drop at some points, however.</li><li>An improved replay editor, including the much requested ability to set up a tripod and film from a stationary position.</li></ol><h2>Game Modes</h2><h3>Career</h3><p style="">The basic mode you'd find in any modern skateboarding game. The challenges are almost exactly the same as in <a href="///">skate.</a> They include:</p><ul><li><b>Photo and Video Challenges</b>, in which the player is asked to complete trick-based goals for a camera.</li><li><b>Pro Challenges,</b> in which a professional skateboarder will ask the player to complete a task, which may vary depending upon the professional's style and the location of the challenge.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Jam Sessions,</b> in which the player must outscore computer opponents at a specific location. These last 3 rounds of varying time limits.</li><li><b>Death Races</b>, in which the player will race computer opponents from one location to another.</li><li><b>Own The Spot Challenges,</b> in which the player must beat a predetermined score at a specific location.</li><li><b>S.K.A.T.E.,</b> in which the player will attempt to repeat the trick that a computer controlled professional skateboarder completed, while attempting to make the professional skateboarder miss their own trick.</li></ul><h3>Freeskate</h3><p style="">Freeskate mode lets your roam the city without having to worry about challenges. You can even skate as any of the playable characters (if you've unlocked them through career mode) if you want or your career skater. Freeskate mode will let you adjust the amount of pedestrians and traffic before you start. You can turn them both completely off if they get in your way and you can even turn off the mongo corp zones. Those are the areas that you're not allowed to skate at in the career mode.</p><h3>Multiplayer</h3><p style="">There are multiple modes you can play online with up to six players. All modes can be played in ranked and unranked.</p><p style=""><b>Freeskate</b></p><p style="">You can do whatever you want in this mode. Just skate around with other players and have fun. A player can also activate freeskate activities that other players can join if they want. Some activities are easy like "Everyone boardslide this rail" but there are more complex ones where all the players must nail a sequence of tricks.</p><p style=""><b>Spot Battle</b></p><p style="">In spot battle all players take turns and get 3 tries to set a high score on a specific skating spot. Some spots are "one trick only" spots, meaning you can only perform one trick on the spot and your turn is done. Some "one trick only" spots will allow you to manual and link your tricks but some will stop adding your points as soon as you start your manual. There are also "session spots". On these spots you have a time limit, usually about 45 seconds, to rack up as many points as you can on the spot. These spots are usually pools, fountains or verts.</p><p style=""><b>Death Race</b></p><p style="">Death Race are races down mountains and hills. Points don't count in this mode, just make it down to the finish line first.</p><p style=""><b>Jam</b></p><p style="">In Jam mode there are 3 rounds where you try to score as many points as you can in the area you're at. All skaters skate at the same time in Jam. At the end of a round, the player with the highest score gets 6 points, the player with the lowest gets 1. Which ever player has the most of these points after all 3 rounds wins the Jam. There are other variations in Jam. Some rounds, instead of seeing who can get the most total points, you'll need to see who can do the most spins or who can get the most points from only grinding or the most points from only doing flip tricks.</p><p style=""><b>SKATE</b></p><p style="">SKATE is essentially the game of HORSE. A player will be asked to "set the trick". That player will need to do some sort of flip trick since grabs don't count. If the player lands the trick then the next player will have to copy his exact trick. If he doesn't copy the trick exactly then he will get a "S". If you fail at doing the tricks enough you will spell out SKATE and you will be knocked out of the game and have to wait for the next game to start. When a player is setting the trick he has to do something original. This means someone can't just keep doing triple kickflip 540s over and over. If a player repeats a trick his turn will be forfeited and it will be the next players turn to set the trick.</p><p style=""><b>Hall of Meat</b></p><p style="">The Hall of Meat mode is about as easy as it gets. All players need to do is crash. The more damage you do to your body, the more points you get. The amount of points you get will also go up depending on how fast you were going when you crashed, if you hit objects, how many rotations your body does in the air and how long your wipeout lasted.</p><h3>Party Play</h3><p style="">Party play is the local multiplayer mode. In party play you can play the modes Spot Battle, SKATE and Hall of Meat with up to 4 players. Your career skater won't be a playable character here but you'll be able to choose from 30 other skaters. The cool thing about party play is you only need one controller to play 4 player, you just have to pass the controller around. You can also play with 4 controllers if you want to.</p><h2>Annals of Meat</h2><p style="">Crashing has a new meaning in Skate 2. You can earn big bucks by crashing and doing Challenges which involve bailing in a specific way, this somehow implies that all skaters have impeccable insurance. You can access all of your bail statistics from Slappy's.</p><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1717/1087043-trop019.png" data-ref-id="1300-1087043" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="1" data-width="240" style="width: 240px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1717/1087043-trop019.png" data-ref-id="1300-1087043"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1717/1087043-trop019.png"></a><figcaption>The hall of meat logo</figcaption></figure><p style="">blog by clicking on the Annals of Meat.</p><h3>Top Bails</h3><p style="">The first of the three tabs is your "Top Bails" that Stores your top 10 bails and shows what bones you broke, when you did it, where you did it and how much damage you received.</p><h3>Bail Stats</h3><p style="">The second tab is your "Bail Stats" which shows you all of you stats.</p><p style="">On your bail stats you can see:</p><ul><li>Breaks - Shows how many bones you've broken overall.

You can use the normal game camera, a free camera, or a tripod camera. Each of these cameras can be aimed, and with the free and tripod cameras repositioned. The clips you make can then be uploaded to the <a href="http://skatereel.ea.com/" rel="nofollow">skate.reel</a> website. Additional cameras and clip space may be purchased in the Filmer Pack DLC available for both XBOX 360 and Playstation 3 consoles. The update adds much more customization to the cameras, allowing custom panning and paths. It also increases your clip allotment from the default ninety seconds to five minutes.</p><h2>Skaters</h2><p style="">The following is a list of professional skateboarders in Skate 2:</p><ol><li><a data-ref-id="3005-11734" href="/pj-ladd/3005-11734/" slug="pj-ladd">PJ Ladd</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-5352" href="/rob-dyrdek/3005-5352/" slug="rob-dyrdek">Rob Dyrdek</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-12151" href="/dennis-busenitz/3005-12151/" slug="dennis-busenitz">Dennis Busenitz</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-11733" href="/jerry-hsu/3005-11733/" slug="jerry-hsu">Jerry Hsu</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3040-67085" href="/patrick-duffy/3040-67085/" slug="patrick-duffy">Pat Duffy</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-12147" href="/colin-mckay/3005-12147/" slug="colin-mckay">Colin McKay</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-9355" href="/danny-way/3005-9355/" slug="danny-way">Danny Way</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-11735" href="/jason-dill/3005-11735/" slug="jason-dill">Jason Dill</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-12152" href="/alex-chalmers/3005-12152/" slug="alex-chalmers">Alex Chalmers</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3040-51704" href="/ryan-smith/3040-51704/" slug="ryan-smith">Ryan Smith</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3040-89792" href="/chris-haslam/3040-89792/" slug="chris-haslam">Chris Haslam</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3040-71903" href="/mike-carrol/3040-71903/" slug="mike-carrol">Mike Carroll</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-23678" href="/chris-cole/3005-23678/" slug="chris-cole">Chris Cole</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-12153" href="/john-rattray/3005-12153/" slug="john-rattray">John Rattray</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-12154" href="/terry-kennedy/3005-12154/" slug="terry-kennedy">Terry Kennedy</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-12155" href="/ryan-gallant/3005-12155/" slug="ryan-gallant">Ryan Gallant</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-5598" href="/lucas-puig/3005-5598/" slug="lucas-puig">Lucas Puig</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-12166" href="/mark-appleyard/3005-12166/" slug="mark-appleyard">Mark Appleyard</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-12167" href="/braydon-szafranski/3005-12167/" slug="braydon-szafranski">Braydon Szafranski</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-5354" href="/john-cardiel/3005-5354/" slug="john-cardiel">John Cardiel</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-6031" href="/eric-koston/3005-6031/" slug="eric-koston">Eric Koston</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-12179" href="/darren-navarette/3005-12179/" slug="darren-navarette">Darren Navarette</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-12168" href="/marc-johnson/3005-12168/" slug="marc-johnson">Marc Johnson</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-12180" href="/jake-brown/3005-12180/" slug="jake-brown">Jake Brown</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-12181" href="/ray-barbee/3005-12181/" slug="ray-barbee">Ray Barbee</a></li></ol><p style=""><u>Other Playable Characters</u></p><ol><li><a data-ref-id="3005-8773" href="/giovanni-reda/3005-8773/" slug="giovanni-reda">Giovanni "The Mouth" Reda</a></li><li>Chris "Cuz" Parry (skate. 2 Producer)</li><li>Atiba Jefferson (The Skateboard Magazine Photographer)</li><li>Michael Burnett (Thrasher Photographer)</li><li>Slappy</li><li>Sammy</li><li>Shingo</li><li>Mike</li><li>Christopher "Big Black" Boykin (Unlocked by entering <b>letsdowork</b> in the cheats screen)</li><li>Dem Bonez (Unlocked by completing all Hall of Meat Paths)</li><li>Freeway</li><li>Seb</li></ol><h2>Skateboard Companies</h2><p style="">The following is a list of skateboard companies in Skate 2:</p><ol><li>Alien Workshop</li><li>Almost</li><li>AntiHero</li><li>Baker</li><li>Black Label</li><li>Blind</li><li>Chocolate</li><li>Cliche</li><li>Creature</li><li>Darkstar</li><li>Element</li><li>Enjoi</li><li>Flip</li><li>Girl</li><li>LRG</li><li>Mystery</li><li>Plan B</li><li>Real</li><li>Santa Cruz</li><li>Shut</li><li>Vans</li><li>Think</li><li>Zero</li></ol><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p style="">The following is the soundtrack for Skate 2:</p><ul><li>"Uptown Top Ranking" - Althea &amp; Donna</li><li>"Anubis" - Anubis</li><li>"The Dull Blade" - ASG</li><li>"I Want A Snake" - Awesome Snakes</li><li>"Symptom Of The Universe" - Black Sabbath</li><li>"Shockwave" - Black Tide</li><li>"Stay On Or Die" - China Creeps</li><li>"Addictive" - Cut Chemist</li><li>"Beneath The Wheel" - D.R.I.</li><li>"Go Ahead On" - Dayton Sidewinders</li><li>"Heroes Of Our Time" - Dragonforce</li><li>"Show Down" - ELO</li><li>"Collarbone" - Fujiya &amp; Miyagi</li><li>"Step In The Arena" - Gang Starr</li><li>"I'da Called You Woody, Joe" - Gaslight Anthem</li><li>"She Wore Rat Skin Boots" - Goons Of Doom"</li><li>"Piglets" - Guilty Simpson</li><li>"They Fall Apart" - High Tension Wires</li><li>"Freewheel Burning" - Judas Priest"</li><li>"S.K.A.T.E." - Korrupted Hoodlums</li><li>"Cold Beats" - Koushik feat.

Or ParentCorp?). You are then reminded how to ride your board, and given instructions on how to get under a horizontal bar. All of this to a soundtrack of Wu Tang and WAR. You are then shown Slappy's park, which embodies the whole "skateboarding is still kinda punk" vibe. You are given further instruction on manuals, fliptricks, ollies and the like. All of the challenges you complete increase your time to skate afterward.</p><p style="">If you complete all of the challenges teaching you how to do tricks, you are given opportunities to skate for film and photography challenges, as Atiba and Reda aim lenses at you.</p><p style="">After all of this gamut and tutorials, you are given time to skate in Slappy's park, wreaking havoc upon the ramps and semi-street that litter the park.</p><h2>Installations</h2><p style="">The PS3 version of Skate 2 requires a 2182MB (just over 2GB) installation to run. The optional installation on Xbox 360 weighs in at 6.8 GB.</p><h2><b>Achievements/Trophies</b></h2><p style="">Achievements in Skate 2 are handled a little differently than in the first game. A larger portion of the achievements are tied to the main story line and other offline tasks. You no longer have to get footage rated or master all of the online disciplines to get a full 1000 GS. For a full list of Achievements/Trophies, check the guides at the top of the page.</p><h2>Downloadable Content</h2><p style="">During development, it was mentioned by Blackbox that downloadable content was to be a large part of the game. This is a major departure from the original Skate which saw none at all. Soon after release, the Filmer pack became available, offering advanced camera controls, custom watermarks, some new gear as well as an increased amount of footage time (from 3 minutes to 5) available to be uploaded to <a href="http://skatereel.ea.com/" rel="nofollow">SkateReel</a>. The Filmer Pack cost is 600 ms points, or $7.50 US.</p><p style="">On February 19, 2009 Skate 2 saw its first world expansion with Dyrdek's Fantasy Plaza Pack. This includes a recreation of <a data-ref-id="3005-5352" href="/rob-dyrdek/3005-5352/" slug="rob-dyrdek">Rob Dyrdek</a>'s Fantasy Factory skatepark which is the setting for his new show on MTV. Also included is the surrounding area modeled after portions of downtown Los Angeles. The cost for this is 400 ms points or $5.00 US.</p><p style="">On February 26, 2009, the San Van Classic Pack was released. This pack includes three areas from the original Skate: Parkade, Community Center, and Oliver Elementary School. This is priced at 400 ms points or $5.00 US. These areas, along with the Fantasy Factory, are not physically connected to New San Vanelona. The only way to access them is through a new downloaded section of the location list. All of these locations are available in freeskate, career, and online modes.</p><p style="">Accompanying these new packs are new filmer challenges, own the spot challenges, and jam session tournaments. Ten new achievements also join the ranks, bringing Skate 2 to 1250 total points. These are spread out through both content packs.</p><p style="">On March 5, 2009, The Throwback Pack was released. Originally obtained via special Pre-order codes from Gamestop, players may now download the pack free of charge. Contained within are new Retro clothes that can be used to customize the player's created skater. Clothes include new tops, sunglasses, pants and socks resembling fashion trends from the 70s and 80s.</p><p style="">The Maloof Money Cup Pack will be released on July 9th 2009 for $3.00 US or 240 MS points. The Maloof Money Cup includes a new skatepark inspired by the real world competition of the same name. Both vert and street areas will be included. The Maloof Money Cup holds the largest cash purse for any skateboarding competition. Also included will be new achievements totaling 250 gs bringing skate 2 to 1500 points total.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>20661</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/1897554-box_skate2.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/1897554-box_skate2.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/1897554-box_skate2.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/1897554-box_skate2.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/1897554-box_skate2.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1897554-box_skate2.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/1897554-box_skate2.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Skate 2]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>29</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-1/]]></api_detail_url><id>1</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: T]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-31/]]></api_detail_url><id>31</id><name><![CDATA[OFLC: M]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-2/]]></api_detail_url><id>2</id><name><![CDATA[PEGI: 16+]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-33/]]></api_detail_url><id>33</id><name><![CDATA[CERO: B]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2009-01-21 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-86/]]></api_detail_url><id>86</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360 Games Store]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360-games-store/3045-86/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[XBGS]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/skate-2/3030-20661/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[F.E.A.R 2

When Monolith was purchased by <a href="../../warner-bros-interactive-entertainment-inc/65-4405/" rel="nofollow">Warner Bros. Interactive</a>, Monolith retained all rights to the F.E.A.R. franchise except, specifically, the F.E.A.R. name, which was retained by <a href="../../vivendi-games/65-6398/" rel="nofollow">Vivendi Interactive</a>, the publisher of F.E.A.R.</p><p style="">Needing an original title for their game, Monolith held a contest called "Name Your Fear" where fans submitted suggestions for the title of the game, and "Project Origin" was the result. Despite the new name, Project Origin was intended be a proper sequel to F.E.A.R. in every regard. The events of <a href="../../fear-extraction-point/61-11787/" rel="nofollow">F.E.A.R.: Extraction Point</a> and <a href="/fear-perseus-mandate/3030-15596/" data-ref-id="3030-15596">F.E.A.R: Perseus Mandate</a> are ignored, as Monolith had no role in the making of those expansions and so does not acknowledge them as canon in their official F.E.A.R. fiction. In a fitting conclusion, Warner Bros. Interactive, in September 2008, bought the rights to the F.E.A.R. name from Vivendi Interactive, and renamed Project Origin to "F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin", at last reuniting the game with its namesake.</p><h2>Plot</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5874/662159-211554_project_origin_alma_super.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-662159" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.56166666666667" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5874/662159-211554_project_origin_alma_super.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-662159"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5874/662159-211554_project_origin_alma_super.jpg"></a><figcaption>Alma.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The self-destruction of the Origin Facility at the end of the original F.E.A.R., despite taking the majority of the city of Auburn and most of its population with it, was not powerful enough to destroy the monstrous psychic entity known as <a href="/alma-wade/3005-429/" data-ref-id="3005-429">Alma Wade</a>. The player is a Delta Force operative named <a href="../../michael-becket/94-7292/" rel="nofollow">Michael Becket</a> whose squad is sent in shortly before the ending of the original game to capture <a href="/genevieve-aristide/3005-15670/" data-ref-id="3005-15670">Genevieve Aristide</a>, the president of the Armacham Corporation, which was responsible for torturing Alma and turning her into the creature she is today. After being knocked out in the shock wave created by the destruction of Auburn, Becket is captured by Aristide's personal security, and forced to become an unwilling candidate for Project Harbinger, which grants him superhuman reflexes, much like the <a href="../../fear-point-man/94-430/" rel="nofollow">Point Man</a>'s. After awakening, Becket must search for a way to rejoin his squad and escape from the hospital facility he finds himself trapped in, while working to avoid murderous commandos on Armacham's payroll, sent to destroy the facility and cover up all evidence of the company's wrong-doing, as well as dealing with gibbering, murderous failed experiments, an army of <a href="/replica-soldier/3015-4779/" data-ref-id="3015-4779">Replica Soldiers</a> who were mysteriously activated, and the unsettling growing interest Alma seems to have in Becket personally.</p><p style=""> </p><h2>Other Armacham Projects</h2><h3>Project Harbinger</h3><p style="">Project Harbinger is a top-secret program within Armacham Technology Corporation(ATC). The main goal of this project is to give ordinary individuals psychic powers that would allow them to control Replica soldiers. These powers are given through a surgical procedure, which plants psychic diodes in the subjects brain and spinal cord, and further amplified by tuning the individual to the proper psychic frequency within the Telesthetic Attunement Chamber(TAC). This procedure is extremely unreliable, with most subjects undergoing the psychic treatment becoming mentally unstable and completely uncontrollable, resulting in the abominations the player must fight in the hospital and other areas of the game. The player discovers through cutscenes and intel items throughout the game that almost all of the members of Becket's squad, including Becket himself, were forced into the program and given these psychic powers. It is this surgical procedure, along with Becket being tuned to Alma's psychic frequency within the TAC, that cause Alma to pursue Becket relentlessly.</p><h3>Project Paragon</h3><p style="">Project Paragon is a top-secret program within Armacham Technology Corporation(ATC). The main goal of this project is to identify children with psychic potential and mold them while they are still impressionable. This project began after Project Origin was shut down and afforded ATC the opportunity to experiment with telesthetic abilities without the complications that were involved with Alma. These children were split into three groups - Treefrogs, Bluebirds, and Ladybugs - at Wade Elementary School, with each different group receiving a different chemical compound derived from the powers of <a href="../../paxton-fettel/94-1244/" rel="nofollow">Paxton Fettel</a>. Children who were deemed to have psychic potential were marked as prime candidates for Project Harbinger.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5874/662165-332022_932147_20080717_screen004_super.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-662165" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.56166666666667" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5874/662165-332022_932147_20080717_screen004_super.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-662165"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5874/662165-332022_932147_20080717_screen004_super.jpg"></a><figcaption>The game features pilotable mechs.</figcaption></figure><p style="">One major change that that had been planned for the game (besides the <a href="../../fear-point-man/94-430/" rel="nofollow">Point Man</a> not the main protagonist) was a change in the health system. The original game's health bar system was supposed to be replaced by the popular <a href="../../regenerating-health/92-83/" rel="nofollow">regenerating health</a> meters that got was popularized in <a href="../../halo-2/61-7110/" rel="nofollow">Halo 2</a> and has been in many other games such as <a href="../../gears-of-war/61-12231/" rel="nofollow">Gears of War</a> and <a href="../../call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare/61-2133/" rel="nofollow">Call of Duty 4</a>. That is until the developers decided that it took away from the horror aspect, so F.E.A.R. 2 used the same health system as the original F.E.A.R. , but allowed the player to carry only three health packs at a time as opposed to the ten you could carry in F.E.A.R.</p><p style="">Another change is the interactions that the player will have with <a href="../../alma-wade/94-429/" rel="nofollow">Alma</a> herself. In <a href="../../fear-first-encounter-assault-recon/61-4800/" rel="nofollow">F.E.A.R.</a> the younger Alma did not actually try to kill the Point Man but was for the most part toying with him, watching him curiously. Now that her older side of her personality has escaped, the older version will feature an angrier Alma, and will try to get rid of every living thing in her path, including Michael Becket.</p><p style="">The last big change to F.E.A.R. 2 is the new <a href="/cover-system/3015-55/" data-ref-id="3015-55">cover system</a>. This cover system allows the player to create their own cover by knocking over <a href="/table/3055-282/" data-ref-id="3055-282">tables</a>, bookshelves, etc. In the original F.E.A.R. the A.I. solders created their own cover all the time when they thought they were losing in a firefight. Now the player can now do the same to even up the odds a bit. <a href="/mech/3055-21/" data-ref-id="3055-21">Mech</a> battles have also been added to the game.

The game was initially intended to be a PS3 exclusive, but at <a href="/e3-2008/3015-3499/" data-ref-id="3015-3499">E3 2008</a>, Microsoft officially announced that Final Fantasy XIII was indeed coming to the Xbox 360 as well, and that it was going to be simultaneously released with the PS3 version internationally, following the Japanese PS3 release of the game in late 2009. It was released in the United States and Europe on March 9, 2010. The game is set in a futuristic world called <a href="/pulse/3035-1192/" data-ref-id="3035-1192">Pulse</a> that is filled with dangerous creatures that freely roam the land. It also features a paranoid <a href="/utopian-civilization/3015-1716/" data-ref-id="3015-1716">Utopian society</a> that is secluded and shut from the dangerous world that it lives on, called <a href="/cocoon/3035-1191/" data-ref-id="3035-1191">Cocoon</a>.</p><p style="">Final Fantasy XIII is the major title in the <a href="/fabula-nova-crystallis/3025-612/" data-ref-id="3025-612">Fabula Nova Crystallis</a> series, along with <a href="/final-fantasy-versus-xiii/3030-21006/" data-ref-id="3030-21006">Final Fantasy Versus XIII</a> and <a href="/final-fantasy-xiii-2/3030-33883/" data-ref-id="3030-33883">Final Fantasy XIII-2</a> .

A woman calling herself <a href="/lightning/3005-773/" data-ref-id="3005-773">Lightning</a> is the main character of the game. She has limited control over gravity by use of technology which makes the magic of the world usable by humans, commonly known as "manadrive." She specializes in collapsible weapons which can transform from a sword into a semi-automatic rifle.</p><p style="">The game is set in two sister worlds - Cocoon and Pulse. The beginning of the game takes place in the technologically advanced upper-world called <a href="/cocoon/3035-1191/" data-ref-id="3035-1191">Cocoon</a>. Later on the player travels to the apparently much larger, untamed lower-world of Pulse. They are two separate planetoids, with a long history of paranoia and bloody warfare against the other. Humans are forbidden from traveling to or from Cocoon by the government, making it an enclosed society ruled by <a href="/falcie/3015-4782/" data-ref-id="3015-4782">fal'Cie</a> -- god-like beings who assign a human to govern Cocoon's citizens. However, there also exist fal'Cie from Pulse who turn humans into <a href="/lcie/3015-4802/" data-ref-id="3015-4802">l'Cie</a> (pronounced as Luh-See). These people are branded with a symbol somewhere on their body, given the ability to use magic, and given a single task known as a 'focus.'</p><p style="">If they carry out their focus and complete the task the fal'Cie assigns them, they are 'rewarded' by being transformed into crystals to live forever in an eternal sleep. If they fail, however, and the brand progresses too far, they are transformed into <a href="/cieth/3015-4805/" data-ref-id="3015-4805">Cie'th</a> -- soulless, <a href="/zombie/3015-79/" data-ref-id="3015-79">zombie</a>-like creatures who are robbed of free will and exist only to kill anyone they come into contact with. With the destiny of either becoming crystals or being robbed of their souls for eternity, most people view becoming l'Cie as a death sentence, as there is no known way to reverse the condition.</p><p style="">Lightning's sister, <a href="/serah-farron/3005-13194/" data-ref-id="3005-13194">Serah</a>, is cursed with this destiny, but it's not long before Lightning, <a href="/snow-villiers/3005-3988/" data-ref-id="3005-3988">Snow</a>, <a href="/sazh-katzroy/3005-9247/" data-ref-id="3005-9247">Sazh</a>, <a href="/hope-estheim/3005-11668/" data-ref-id="3005-11668">Hope</a>, and <a href="/oerba-dia-vanille/3005-9072/" data-ref-id="3005-9072">Vanille</a> become I'Cie themselves, as their destinies bring themselves together to battle the same pulse fal'Cie who transformed Lightning's sister and many citizens of the Cocoon town of Bodhum. This pulse fal'Cie was discovered to have been sleeping for centuries only to be awakened by the Sanctum (Cocoon's human government) forces just outside of the town. Because the citizens of Cocoon view any l'Cie as a threat, all the people who happened to be in Bodhum at the time were to be exiled to the world of Pulse below in order to keep Cocoon pure.</p><p style="">Unsure as to what their focus is at first, the five new l'Cie set out to battle Sanctum, who, as it turns out, were only using the exile (known as the 'Purge') as a cover to kill them all. After all, the government considers anything from Pulse to be an enemy of Cocoon; by coming into contact with the Pulse Fal'Cie, the people of Bodhum become enemies of Sanctum. The beings on Pulse are at war with Cocoon and there is a large hole in Cocoon from an attack from Pulse several centuries before. Taking place in Cocoon and later on the surface of Pulse, the game covers the adventure of the new l'Cie as they try to figure out what their focus is and then fulfill it to avoid becoming Cie'th.</p><h2>Characters</h2><h3>Playable Characters</h3><p style="">There are six playable characters in Final Fantasy XIII.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="medium" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/15/151174/2125381-7dic_big.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2125381" data-ratio="0.56435006435006" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/15/151174/2125381-7dic_big.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2125381"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/15/151174/2125381-7dic_big.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/15/151174/2125381-7dic_big.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style=""><a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/lightning/3005-773/" data-ref-id="3005-773">Lightning</a> – The main character of the game. Lightning is a tough young woman previously associated with the Cocoon Guardian Corps. She is given the task to fulfill her "focus" after becoming a l'Cie. The two yellow stripes on the her left shoulder symbolize her Rank in the Guardian Corps. Lightning has long light pink hair and is 178 cm (70.1 inches) tall. For her design, character designer <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/tetsuya-nomura/3040-637/" data-ref-id="3040-637">Tetsuya Nomura</a> was asked to create someone like a "female version of <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/cloud-strife/3005-321/" data-ref-id="3005-321">Cloud Strife</a> from <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/final-fantasy-vii/3030-13053/" data-ref-id="3030-13053">Final Fantasy VII</a>." During development, he described her as "not very feminine." Lightning wields a <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/gunblade/3055-314/" data-ref-id="3055-314">gunblade</a>, that can transform into a sword or gun on the fly. Lightning has buttons on her finger tip and thumb which can be used to manipulate gravity. She controls Odin, a giant god-like warrior who turns into a horse in Gestalt mode. She is voiced by <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/ali-hillis/3040-97269/" data-ref-id="3040-97269">Ali Hillis</a> in the English version and by <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/maaya-sakamoto/3040-100610/" data-ref-id="3040-100610">Maaya Sakamoto</a> in the Japanese version. Her personality evolves throughout the game. She's seen at the beginning of the game as a cold, distant character, not caring for any of the other members of her party.

The battle system lets players control only the main party leader (who switches throughout the game), while only controlling the class of the other two party members, not specific actions. The main premise of the battle system consists of the player trying to chain attacks against monsters so that they become staggered and take extra damage. There is also a heavy emphasis on constant <i>Paradigm</i> shifts during combat.</p><ul><li><b>ATB (Active Time Battle) Gauge</b> – Characters use skills and abilities by spending segments of the ATB gauge. In battle, this gauge charges continuously over time and allows players to queue up commands as the bar goes up. Each ability has an associated ATB cost which indicates how many segments would be used to execute that ability. More powerful abilities have higher ATB costs and require players to wait for longer periods before executing that skill. The size of the ATB gauge (and its number of segments) increases as players level up and progress through the game.</li><li><b>Auto-Battle</b> – Players have the choice to pick their own abilities each turn or let the game's auto-battle system decide it for them. The system takes into account things like target vulnerabilities and weaknesses, player health, and enemy position for <a href="/splash-damage/3015-347/" data-ref-id="3015-347">area-of-effect</a> attacks.</li><li><b>Chains and Staggering</b> – Located at the top right of the screen, the chain gauge fills up as players deal more hits to that target. Enemies take more damage as the gauge slowly fills up until they reach the Stagger point. A staggered enemy takes far more damage from regular attacks and allows the use of selected special abilities. For example, staggered enemies can often be launched into the air by a Commando, which allows the party to juggle them in the air with repeated attacks.</li><li><b>Techniques</b> – Players earn Technique Points from each encounter that can be used for special skills like <i>Libra</i> which reveals special information about enemies such as their weaknesses. Technique Points take time to accumulate so the use of techniques is limited and the game recommends players save them for tougher encounters. They are also used to summon Eidolons. Summoning uses 3 Technique Points.</li><li><b>Items</b> – Items like potions or <a href="/phoenix-down/3055-1009/" data-ref-id="3055-1009">phoenix down</a>s can be used at any time without wasting the ATB gauge. The game calls these "free actions". Potions heal hit points for the entire party instead of just one member.</li><li><b>Pre-emptive Strikes -</b> If the player initiates a battle without being discovered by the enemy, they will gain a preemptive strike. The player character will charge forth and strike each enemy in the fight, instantly driving their chain gauges up so far that they will be staggered with one hit. Enemies cannot get a preemptive strike on the party.</li></ul><h3>Paradigms</h3><p style="">Paradigms are player-configured setups that change the roles of each party member during combat. Since the players can't control their party members directly, paradigms are the only way to change their AI behavior. Players can fill up to 6 paradigms slots, ranging from offensive to defensive setups before a battle starts. Paradigms can be created by hand or generated by the game.</p><h3>Roles</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1296220-ability.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1296220" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1296220-ability.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1296220"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1296220-ability.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1296220-ability.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Fang's Skills &amp; Abilities</figcaption></figure><p style="">Roles are essentially <a href="/classes/3015-405/" data-ref-id="3015-405">character classes</a>. Each character has access to multiple roles that provide unique skills. Each role has an associated Role Bonus that augments that role's purpose. Players can level up their character in a particular role by spending crystogen points (essentially <a href="/experience-points/3015-39/" data-ref-id="3015-39">experience points</a>). The leveling up process is called Crystogenesis<i>,</i> found under the Crystarium menu.</p><p style="">These are the six roles available in FFXIII:</p><ul><li><b>Commando (COM)</b> – Offensive specialists that deal extra physical and magical damage. Ravagers will target whichever enemy the Commando in the party is attacking. Role Bonus: Augmented Attacks.</li><li><b>Ravager (RAV)</b> – Magic specialists that deals fire, ice, lightning, water and other elemental damage. Role Bonus: Improved Chaining.</li><li><b>Sentinel (SEN)</b> – Defensive specialists that can protect themselves and their allies by provoking enemies and soaking up large amounts of damage that would have otherwise done much damage to teammates. Role Bonus: Damage Reduction.</li><li><b>Medic (MED)</b> – Healers that can restore party members HP, cure ailments and even revive KO-ed allies. Role Bonus: Augmented Healing.</li><li><b>Synergist (SYN)</b> – Buffers and support specialist that increase party member's abilities and grants additional defensive bonuses. Role Bonus: Extended Enhancements.</li><li><b>Saboteur (SAB)</b> – Another support class that specializes in debuffs. They weaken enemy resistances and make them more vulnerable to attacks, along with filling and maintaining the Chain Gauge. Role Bonus: Boosted Success Rate.</li></ul><p style="">Note that all of the Role Bonuses affect the entire party. For example, a Medic's augmented healing affects the Sentinel's skill "Mediguard" as well, and the Sentinel's damage reduction protects the entire party.</p><h3>Eidolons</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1296252-alexander_gestal_purification.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1296252" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1296252-alexander_gestal_purification.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1296252"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1296252-alexander_gestal_purification.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1296252-alexander_gestal_purification.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Gestalt Mode</figcaption></figure><p style="">Eidolons are special creatures that can be summoned by players during combat to gain access to powerful skills and abilities. Players first need to defeat an Eidolon in a one-on-one battle to gain their allegiance. They are summoned using 3 Technique Points (TP). Each Eidolon can also transform into Gestalt Mode that allows players to ride and use the creature directly. Players lose access to their normal skills and even party members during this mode, but instead gain direct attacks through pre-configured button presses. Here is a list of the Eidolons in the game and their respective characters:</p><ul><li><b>The Shiva Sisters (Stiria &amp; Nix)</b>: Snow Villiers - acquired during Chapter 3</li><li><b>Odin</b>: Lightning - acquired during Chapter 4</li><li><b>Brynhildr</b>: Sazh Katzroy - acquired during Chapter 8</li><li><b>Bahamut</b>: Fang - acquired during Chapter 10</li><li><b>Alexander</b>: Hope Estheim - acquired during Chapter 11</li><li><b>Hecatoncheir</b>: Vanille - acquired during Chapter 11</li></ul><p style="">When a player uses an Eidolon, the player character automatically receives full health and Doom counters are paused. In addition, all party members receive full health when an Eidolon exits the fight. Players can use this to their advantage if their team is taking a heavy beating.</p><h3>Crystarium</h3><p style="">Similar to Final Fantasy X's Sphere Grid, the Crystarium is a linear method of character advancement. After a battle, the player receives a set amount of Crystogen Points (CP), which can then be used to connect to crystals in the Crystarium. The CP is doled out equally to every character in the game for every fight, regardless of whether they participated in the battle or not. The Crystarium is divided up by Paradigm roles, and apart from a few protruding branches the advancement is mostly straightforward. Any stat bonuses or techniques earned in the Crystarium (HP, ATK, STR, etc) are instantly applied to the character; however, any abilities learned are still relegated to the designated Paradigm.</p><h3>Upgrading Equipment</h3><p style="">Both weapons and accessories can be upgraded by adding either mechanical or biological components to them. Each component added has an XP value as well as an impact on the items XP multiplier. The quantity of components added each time also has an effect. Once an item reaches a certain level of XP it will level up, increasing various statistics. Each item also has a level cap identified by a star. At this point no further improvement can be made unless the item is transformed into a new form via the addition of special components. The new item will be weaker than the old one and have different properties, but has a greater potential for improvement. Equipment can also be dismantled to give the player various components which can then be integrated back into other weapons or accessories.</p><p style="">Players can also gain hidden bonuses by equipping specific pieces of gear at the same time. For example, the Axis Blade, a weapon exclusive to Lightning, charges an ATB segment when an enemy is attacked. If this is equipped alongside the accessory Whistlewind Scarf, the player's ATB gauge will gain +10% recharge rate. If the player equips a few more specific items, they can increase the recharge rate by up to 30%, allowing them to attack at a higher rate.</p><h3>Save Points</h3><p style="">Saving your game, shopping, and upgrading your weapons and accessories are all relegated to terminals placed frequently throughout the game. Unlike in most RPGs, losing a battle does not send the player back to a Save Point. Players are instead placed right before they started the battle, allowing them to either attempt the fight again, possibly with a preemptive strike, or avoid the fight altogether.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1300203-1300173_15980_1265401507.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1300203" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.8866587957497" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:88.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1300203-1300173_15980_1265401507.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1300203"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3661/1300203-1300173_15980_1265401507.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3661/1300203-1300173_15980_1265401507.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Soundtrack Box Front</figcaption></figure><p style="">Final Fantasy XIII's soundtrack was composed by <a href="/masashi-hamauzu/3040-89749/" data-ref-id="3040-89749">Masashi Hamauzu</a>, who is notable within Square Enix for other composition roles including <a href="/final-fantasy-x/3030-11237/" data-ref-id="3030-11237">Final Fantasy X</a>, <a href="/unlimited-saga/3030-6505/" data-ref-id="3030-6505">Unlimited Saga</a>, and <a href="/saga-frontier-2/3030-18504/" data-ref-id="3030-18504">Saga Frontier II</a> among others. He also wrote the main image song entitled "Kimi Ga iru Kara" sung by J-Pop singer Sayuri Sugawara.

Square Enix explained that although all three games take place in the same universe, they are not directly related in terms of story. The game runs on the Crystal Tools engine, a seventh generation multi-platform game engine built by Square Enix for its future games. The engine and the game were originally slated to be used with the <a href="/playstation-2/3045-19/" data-ref-id="3045-19">PlayStation 2</a>, but were later moved to the PlayStation 3.</p><p style="">Several of the game's developers had worked on previous installments of the series. <a href="/motomu-toriyama/3040-89862/" data-ref-id="3040-89862">Motomu Toriyama</a>, director of <a href="/final-fantasy-x-2/3030-8985/" data-ref-id="3030-8985">Final Fantasy X-2</a>, and director and scenario writer of <a href="/final-fantasy-xii-revenant-wings/3030-10751/" data-ref-id="3030-10751">Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings</a>, directed the game and wrote the story.

The latter started development only after the Japanese PlayStation 3 version was completed.</p><p style="">In December of 2009, Square Enix finally released an official list of differences between the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game. Most notably, it was revealed that the Xbox 360 version will be shipping on three DVDs. Square also announced that the Xbox 360 version would have more compressed audio and 720p FMV, as opposed to the high quality uncompressed audio and 1080p video that the PlayStation 3 version's dual-layer Blu-ray Disc can accommodate. The Xbox 360 version also renders at 1024x576 with 2x MSAA for gameplay and FMV cut scenes as opposed to the full 720p real-time 3D with 2x MSAA of the PS3 version for gameplay and 1920x1080 for FMV cut scenes.</p><p style="">There was not a Japanese release for the Xbox 360 version initially, but was later released as Final Fantasy XIII International on December 16, 2010 and included additional content.</p><h3>Xbox 360 Installation</h3><p style="">Final Fantasy XIII requires 18.3 GB of space to install on an Xbox 360 HDD: 5.9 GB for Disc 1, 5.8 GB for Disc 2, and 6.6 GB for Disc 3. You will still need to switch discs even when installed.</p><h2>Demo</h2><p style="">On April 16, 2009, a playable demo was released as part of the Japanese version of <i>Final Fantasy: Advent Children</i> Blu-ray Disc set. However, the demo was built using an older version of the FFXIII game engine and doesn't fully reflect the final version of the game.</p><h2>Reception</h2><p style="">Final Fantasy XIII received generally favorable reviews with a <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbox360/finalfantasy13" rel="nofollow">Metacritic average of around 82</a>. The departure from a typical Final Fantasy game design was the cause of most of the criticism from reviewers. Among those was the absence of any towns or the lack of an open world throughout the game.</p><p style="">The new battle system on the other hand was universally praised as a good evolution for the series and help streamline what some consider a stale system. The games very high production values and the strong cast of characters set a new benchmark for the series as well.</p><h2>Extras</h2><p style="">This game comes with several extras that are unlocked for earning certain achievements/trophies. For the Xbox 360, these extras take the form of gamer pictures. For the PlayStation 3, these extras take the form of XMB themes.

It was released on October 21, 2008 in North America and on October 23, 2008 in Europe and Australia. Although featuring new characters and storylines, Ubisoft marketed Far Cry 2 as the true sequel to Far Cry. <a href="/crytek-gmbh/3010-268/" data-ref-id="3010-268">Crytek</a>, developers of <a href="/far-cry/3030-14782/" data-ref-id="3030-14782">the original game</a>, were not involved in the development of Far Cry 2. The game is available on <a href="/games-for-windows-live/3015-2452/" data-ref-id="3015-2452">Microsoft Windows</a>, <a href="/playstation-3/3045-35/" data-ref-id="3045-35">PlayStation 3</a>, and <a href="/xbox-360/3045-20/" data-ref-id="3045-20">Xbox 360</a>.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7473/884924-081308_fc2_sunset.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-884924" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7473/884924-081308_fc2_sunset.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-884924"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7473/884924-081308_fc2_sunset.jpg"></a><figcaption>The game gives players an opportunity to soak up a beautiful sunset.</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Far Cry 2 is a sequel only in name, and is said to have absolutely no ties to the past games, other than the obvious one man army style of gameplay. As such, this game will have no mutants, no monsters, and no feral abilities such as those found in <a href="/far-cry-instincts/3030-13290/" data-ref-id="3030-13290"><i>Far Cry Instincts</i></a>. Instead, the player will choose one of nine playable characters. The other 8 characters whom the player did not choose will then appear in other parts of the game. However, they are not like most <a href="/non-player-character/3015-967/" data-ref-id="3015-967">NPCs</a>. If they die, they will remain dead, and missions and story from there on out may be drastically different. Ubisoft has stressed this as one of the many things that contribute to the replayability of Far Cry 2. If the player's health reaches zero, and they have recently asked a buddy to be on stand-by while visiting a safe house, then a small cutscene plays of that Buddy saving the player character. They will then give the player a sidearm and carry on.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Players are working towards the common goal of finding and assassinating an arms dealer known as <a href="/the-jackal/3005-8298/" data-ref-id="3005-8298">The Jackal</a>. The Jackal is the sole reason civil war consumes the game's African locale because he continues dealing arms to both sides of the conflict. However, there are multiple endings due to the dynamic elements of the game (e.g. the aforementioned death of a buddy NPC). One of Far Cry 2's much touted elements is its dynamic gameplay; every decision the player makes may end up impacting the story. If one of the mercenaries were to die, the game would re-organize the social structure according to that mercenary's death. Players can ally themselves with friendly NPCs who can provide certain gameplay perks.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure style="width: 480px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/197031-942192_20070822_screen014.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-197031" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/197031-942192_20070822_screen014.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-197031"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/56/197031-942192_20070822_screen014.jpg"></a><figcaption>Propagating fire.</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Far Cry 2 takes place in a large, open-world, fictional <a href="/africa/3035-284/" data-ref-id="3035-284">African</a> country; which is complete with towns, bodies of water, deserts, and a number of enemy encampments and bases to attack of infiltrate. The map is approximately 52 square kilometers which is larger than <a href="/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas/3030-7120/" data-ref-id="3030-7120">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</a> or <a href="/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/3030-20238/" data-ref-id="3030-20238">Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a>. Far Cry 2 is powered by the <a href="/dunia-engine/3015-3977/" data-ref-id="3015-3977">DUNIA Engine</a> (in many languages this means "earth" or "world"), which is compatible with PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. The engine features a <a href="/daynight-cycle/3015-92/" data-ref-id="3015-92">dynamic day/night cycle</a>, real-time weather effects and persistent environmental decay (such as trees that snap apart and then regrow over time), as well as fire propagation affected by weather, which allows the player to set fires to destroy or distract, possibly even killing enemies. Animals are also included in the game, although only herbivorous animals. Although carnivorous animals were rumored to be <a href="../../downloadable-content/92-329/" rel="nofollow">downloadable content</a>, they were never released or announced. These dynamic gameplay elements encourage the player to play the game in a number of different ways.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The environment of Far Cry 2 is packed full of enemies. Over the course of the game players will encounter many guard outposts, safe houses, and military checkpoints that are swarming with APR and UFLL forces. Both factions will engage in combat if they spot the player, no matter what alliances the player has; also, it is never clear exactly what faction the soldiers belong to because they do not wear uniforms or any other form of identification. These two things were the result of a design choice reflected in multiple main character's dialogues with the player, where they reflect on the fact that the player is a "deniable asset", and explain that even "allied" soldiers will attempt to kill the player character.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Factors including weather, day and night cycles and "advanced" <a href="/artificial-intelligence/3015-218/" data-ref-id="3015-218">A.I. behavior</a> help make the player improvise. The artificial intelligence does several things to create a more realistic enemy. Enemy troops from both the UFLL and APR will sleep, eat and patrol like real people. In the afternoons they may be active and vehicles may be patrolling the woods and desert whereas at night or at dawn the mood and activity will be slower and more relaxed. The AI also can do such things things as pursing the enemy when their weapons or vehicles are stolen or hijacked. They will hunt the player down; their mood will affect how aggressive they are in combat.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Some player-usable vehicles include (but are not limited to):</p><ul><li><a href="../../boat/93-804/" rel="nofollow">Boats</a></li><li><a href="../../hang-glider/93-1749/" rel="nofollow">Hang gliders</a></li><li><a href="/jeep/3055-884/" data-ref-id="3055-884">Jeeps</a></li><li><a href="/buggy/3055-626/" data-ref-id="3055-626">Buggies</a></li><li>Large truck</li><li>Small car</li></ul><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">In Far Cry 2, safe houses play an important role. At a safe house; players can rest, restock, and meet with "buddies" and save the game. There are many of them scattered around the environment, and are marked by a tent icon on the map. Before players can use a safe house, they must clear its immediate vicinity of enemy soldiers. After that, players can safely enter and gain access to the cot, ammo, gun crates, and medical supplies inside. With the cot, players can sleep until a certain time of day, which is useful if players want to get up in the middle of the night to attack a heavily guarded enemy camp. Weapon crates can be purchased at the arms dealer for rough diamonds and are used to store weapons. As long as players have a corresponding crate for the type of weapon they are holding, they can put it into the crate to store for future use. As players and buddies use the safe houses, the amount of supplies stored there will increase. Players will find more ammo and first aid supplies on the shelves.</p><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7473/884916-jeep_farcry_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-884916" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.62608695652174" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7473/884916-jeep_farcry_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-884916"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7473/884916-jeep_farcry_2.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7473/884916-jeep_farcry_2.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The game features officially licensed Jeeps, which are driven in first person.</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Weapons and vehicles can fail, due to things such as jamming, stalling, or engine failure; this depends on how long the player uses a vehicle for. Several vehicles have a turret but not all of them have. NPCs, however, will not get into vehicles with the player; The player must get out of the driver's seat and into the turret. Vehicles have two states of disrepair. One is a white smoke that is coming from the engine and the other is a black smoke. Black smoke means that failing to repair the vehicle will kill the engine and stop the vehicle dead in its tracks. To repair a vehicle simply walk towards the engine and press the use button. The player character will then take out a wrench and fix the engine.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Injury is important in the world of Far Cry 2. The player character will have a five-bar health meter. If any bars get only partially depleted they will regenerate automatically, but any bars that are fully depleted will have to be restored by using a syringe (or drinking water bottles that are commonly found at camps around the world). Initially, players can carry five syringes at a time; one syringe will fully restore the player's health as long as there is more than one health bar section left. If players have fewer than one bar section remaining, then the players character will remove bullets from their body, snap fingers back into position, and even splint broken bones. This takes significantly longer than using a syringe, so healing early is a wise thing to do.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">In Far Cry 2, players will have many ways of obtaining missions. The main way of obtaining missions will be talking to persons of interest like faction leaders at their respective headquarters or buddies at the local bar. Once players begin a conversation that involves them needing work done, they can press a button to obtain an info folder from them. Contained in the folder will be the coordinates of the objective and a short description of the mission. These missions usually involve destroying some strategic thing around the world like fuel tanks, vehicles, or VIPs. Missions can also be taken on from cell phone towers. Approaching a box on the cell phone tower will give players the option to tap into the tower, which will cause their phone to ring. After picking up the phone a heavily distorted voice will tell divulge the location of someone that they want assassinated and will explain that payment will be supplied as soon as the job is done.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Very soon after the game starts, players contract malaria; from there on, players have to start carrying malaria pills to control the symptoms. Players are given a nice supply of the pills at the beginning, but eventually these run out and more will need to be found. The local priest can help players with this, but is reluctant at first because the player character is a mercenary. Eventually he gives in because he hates to see people sick, and gives the player the location of an Underground house. These Underground houses are the hideouts of the few unfortunate civilians remaining in the country. They have malaria pills, but in turn, players will need to complete a task for them to get the pills. When a malaria attack strikes, players must take a pill within a certain amount of time or else they will not survive. A malaria attack while swimming can result in the player character drowning.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The player has access to a large amount of weapons in Far Cry 2, all of which are based on real weapons in the real world.

It is one of the favorites of local militias and mercenaries because it is one of the most reliable weapons in the game. A drawback of the AK-47 however, is that it is not the most accurate rifle, but it does decent damage at close to medium ranges. The accuracy can be less of an issue if players fire in smaller bursts for greater control over the weapon. There is also golden version of the AK-47, which is even more reliable.</p><h3>AR-16</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Difficulty</th><th>Casual</th><th>Normal</th><th>Hardcore</th><th>Infamous</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Default</td><td>30 + 150</td><td>30 + 90</td><td>30 + 90</td><td>30 + 60</td></tr><tr><td>Ammo Upgrade</td><td>30 + 300</td><td>30 + 150</td><td>30 + 120</td><td>30 + 90</td></tr></tbody></table><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Weapon Class: Assault Rifle</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Magazine Capacity:</td><td>30</td><td>Accuracy Upgrade:</td><td>5 Diamonds</td></tr><tr><td>Fire Mode:</td><td>3 round burst</td><td>Reliability Upgrade:</td><td>5 Diamonds</td></tr><tr><td>Weapon Cost:</td><td>20 Diamonds</td><td>Ammo Upgrade:</td><td>10 Diamonds (Assault Webbing)</td></tr><tr><td>Shop Availability:</td><td>Bowa-Seko, Convoy 2</td><td>Multiplayer Availability:</td><td>Saboteur, Level 4</td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Weapon description and Field Notes</h4><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The <a href="/m16a4/3055-339/" data-ref-id="3055-339">AR-16</a> is probably one of the best assault rifles available in the game.

It is the only assault rifle equipped with magnified reflex scope, instead of just the more common iron sights found on other weapons. The scope has green dot that helps players aim at targets.

The AS50 is effective against softer targets like humans, and does not require a headshot for a guaranteed one shot, one kill. However, the drawbacks of the AS50 are that it is extremely expensive, it degrades at a quick rate, and can jam after only a short amount of usage.</p><h3>Dragunov SVD</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Difficulty</th><th>Casual</th><th>Normal</th><th>Hardcore</th><th>Infamous</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Default</td><td>10 + 40</td><td>10 + 20</td><td>10 + 20</td><td>10 + 10</td></tr><tr><td>Ammo Upgrade</td><td>10 + 80</td><td>10 + 40</td><td>10 + 30</td><td>10 + 20</td></tr></tbody></table><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Weapon Class: Sniper Rifle</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Magazine Capacity:</td><td>10</td><td>Accuracy Upgrade:</td><td>5 Diamonds</td></tr><tr><td>Fire Mode:</td><td>Semi-Automatic</td><td>Reliability Upgrade:</td><td>5 Diamonds</td></tr><tr><td>Weapon Cost:</td><td>20 Diamonds</td><td>Ammo Upgrade:</td><td>15 Diamonds (Marksman Bandolier)</td></tr><tr><td>Shop Availability:</td><td>Leboa-Sako, Convoy 4</td><td>Multiplayer Availability:</td><td>Sharpshooter, Level 2</td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Weapon description and Field Notes</h4><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The <a href="/svd-dragunov/3055-320/" data-ref-id="3055-320">Dragunov SVD</a> is an old Soviet-era designed sniper rifle.

The grenades are fed by drum-like cylinder, not so different from the common revolver. A difference to the M-79 grenade launcher is that it fires its rounds in a flatter trajectory, making the MGL-140 easier to aim. In addition, it features a magnified scope, which make it a lot easier to get a direct hit with fired grenades at longer ranges. This intuitive targeting makes it possible to engage the enemy at a tremendously long range, making it ideal to take out vehicles and grouped personnel.</p><h3>Silent MP5</h3><table><tbody><tr><td><figure style="width: 314px" data-align="center" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/14/146864/2126508-weapon_silent_mp5.png" data-ref-id="1300-2126508" data-size="large" data-ratio="0.41082802547771" data-width="314" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:41.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/14/146864/2126508-weapon_silent_mp5.png" data-ref-id="1300-2126508"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/14/146864/2126508-weapon_silent_mp5.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/14/146864/2126508-weapon_silent_mp5.png"></noscript></a></figure></td><td><figure style="width: 199px" data-align="center" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/14/146864/2126510-weapon_silent_mp5_stat.png" data-ref-id="1300-2126510" data-size="large" data-ratio="0.39698492462312" data-width="199" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:39.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/14/146864/2126510-weapon_silent_mp5_stat.png" data-ref-id="1300-2126510"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/14/146864/2126510-weapon_silent_mp5_stat.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/14/146864/2126510-weapon_silent_mp5_stat.png"></noscript></a></figure></td></tr></tbody></table><table><thead><tr><th>Difficulty</th><th>Casual</th><th>Normal</th><th>Hardcore</th><th>Infamous</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Default</td><td>30 + 150</td><td>30 + 90</td><td>30 + 90</td><td>30 + 60</td></tr><tr><td>Ammo Upgrade</td><td>30 + 300</td><td>30 + 150</td><td>30 + 120</td><td>30 + 90</td></tr></tbody></table><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Weapon Class: Submachine gun</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Magazine Capacity:</td><td>30</td><td>Accuracy Upgrade:</td><td>5 Diamonds</td></tr><tr><td>Fire Mode:</td><td>Automatic</td><td>Reliability Upgrade:</td><td>5 Diamonds</td></tr><tr><td>Weapon Cost:</td><td>20 Diamonds</td><td>Ammo Upgrade:</td><td>10 Diamonds (Assault Webbing)</td></tr><tr><td>Shop Availability:</td><td>Leboa-Sako, Convoy 3</td><td>Multiplayer Availability:</td><td>Saboteur, Level 2</td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Weapon description and Field Notes</h4><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The <a href="/mp5/3055-289/" data-ref-id="3055-289">MP5</a> is a silent variant of the popular MP5 sub-machine gun, as it uses a sound suppressor that muffles sound and helps eliminate muzzle flash.

While not as accurate as the Makarov, it is still much easier to control than the Eagle .50.</p><h3>Uzi</h3><table><tbody><tr><td><figure style="width: 246px" data-align="center" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/14/146864/2130081-uzi.png" data-ref-id="1300-2130081" data-size="large" data-ratio="0.48780487804878" data-width="246" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:48.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/14/146864/2130081-uzi.png" data-ref-id="1300-2130081"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/14/146864/2130081-uzi.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/14/146864/2130081-uzi.png"></noscript></a></figure></td><td><figure style="width: 199px" data-align="center" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/14/146864/2130082-uzi_stat.png" data-ref-id="1300-2130082" data-size="large" data-ratio="0.39698492462312" data-width="199" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:39.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/14/146864/2130082-uzi_stat.png" data-ref-id="1300-2130082"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/14/146864/2130082-uzi_stat.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/14/146864/2130082-uzi_stat.png"></noscript></a></figure></td></tr></tbody></table><table><thead><tr><th>Difficulty</th><th>Casual</th><th>Normal</th><th>Hardcore</th><th>Infamous</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Default</td><td>30 + 150</td><td>30 + 90</td><td>30 + 90</td><td>30 + 60</td></tr><tr><td>Ammo Upgrade</td><td>30 + 300</td><td>30 + 150</td><td>30 + 120</td><td>30 + 90</td></tr></tbody></table><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Weapon Class: SMG</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Magazine Capacity:</td><td>30</td><td>Accuracy Upgrade:</td><td>5 Diamonds</td></tr><tr><td>Fire Mode:</td><td>Automatic</td><td>Reliability Upgrade:</td><td>5 Diamonds</td></tr><tr><td>Weapon Cost:</td><td>20 Diamonds</td><td>Ammo Upgrade:</td><td>10 Diamonds (Light Assault Webbing)</td></tr><tr><td>Shop Availability:</td><td>Bowa-Seko, Start</td><td>Multiplayer Availability:</td><td>Rebel, Level 3</td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Weapon description and Field Notes</h4><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The Uzi is an improvement over the MAC-10, and can be obtained from the weapon shop as soon as the player enters Bowa-Seko.

The Dart Rifle has the ability to neutralize targets at long range without a sound. It fires a high-velocity sub-sonic dart that is deadly with a single headshot, and also features a magnified scope. The weapon is a bolt-action design, so players have to stop aiming to load a new dart. Headshots are of importance, as a dart to any other body parts allows the victim to be alerted, which will attract other hostiles.</p><h3>LPO-50</h3><table><tbody><tr><td><figure style="width: 313px" data-align="center" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/14/146864/2132533-lpo_50.png" data-ref-id="1300-2132533" data-size="large" data-ratio="0.21405750798722" data-width="313" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:21.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/14/146864/2132533-lpo_50.png" data-ref-id="1300-2132533"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/14/146864/2132533-lpo_50.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/14/146864/2132533-lpo_50.png"></noscript></a></figure></td><td><figure style="width: 199px" data-align="center" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/14/146864/2132534-lpo_50_stat.png" data-ref-id="1300-2132534" data-size="large" data-ratio="0.39698492462312" data-width="199" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:39.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/14/146864/2132534-lpo_50_stat.png" data-ref-id="1300-2132534"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/14/146864/2132534-lpo_50_stat.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/14/146864/2132534-lpo_50_stat.png"></noscript></a></figure></td></tr></tbody></table><table><thead><tr><th>Difficulty</th><th>Casual</th><th>Normal</th><th>Hardcore</th><th>Infamous</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Default</td><td>500</td><td>300</td><td>300</td><td>200</td></tr><tr><td>Ammo Upgrade</td><td>1.000</td><td>500</td><td>400</td><td>300</td></tr></tbody></table><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Weapon Class: Flamethower</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Magazine Capacity:</td><td>Not available</td><td>Accuracy Upgrade:</td><td>5 Diamonds</td></tr><tr><td>Fire Mode:</td><td>Continuous-Flow</td><td>Reliability Upgrade:</td><td>5 Diamonds</td></tr><tr><td>Weapon Cost:</td><td>20 Diamonds</td><td>Ammo Upgrade:</td><td>10 Diamonds (Pyrotechnic Satchel)</td></tr><tr><td>Shop Availability:</td><td>Bowa-Seko, Convoy 3</td><td>Multiplayer Availability:</td><td>Rebel, Level 1</td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Weapon description and Field Notes</h4><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The <a href="/lpo-50-flamethrower/3055-2407/" data-ref-id="3055-2407">LPO-50 flamethrower</a> dates back to the Soviet-era.

There are several variants of the weapon, but this model sports an iron sight that is not that much different from an assault rifle. It is a fire and forget weapon, meaning unlike the Carl G rocket launcher, the rocket cannot be guided after being fired. It travels in a relatively straight path to the target. It is excellent to use against vehicles, but takes some training to hit moving targets.</p><h3>Ammo upgrades</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Ammo upgrades are purchased from the weapon shop’s computer.

Ranked Matches earn experience towards a persistent player rank, earning diamonds for every level that allow players to purchase unlockables for each class. Far Cry 2 has up to 30 ranks. There are 6 classes in the game, and it's possible to upgrade each at least 3 times with the aforementioned diamonds. Custom games allow for persistence over several maps as long as the users stay in the same room for the duration of the games. Progress in Custom games is lost once a server is ended entirely.</p><h3>Gametypes</h3><ul><li><b>Deathmatch</b>- Standard free-for-all game type in which players kill each other for points. The round ends when a player finally reaches the score limit.</li><li><b>Team Deathmatch</b>- Two teams of up to eight players each compete by killing members of the opposing team for points. Reviving allies while they are wounded removes points from the opposite team's score. Ranked Team Deathmatch games last until the kill count reaches 100, or until 15 minutes are up.</li><li><b>Capture the Diamond</b>- A capture the flag variant in which players steal a case of diamonds from the opposing team's base and bring it back to theirs. A point is scored when both teams' cases are in one base. Diamond carriers emit a "security smoke" to note their locations; green smoke denotes the player's team's carrier, and Green smoke reveals the opponent.</li><li><b>Uprising</b>- This is a team-based game type revolving around capturing several strategic points around the map. Each team has a captain, and the captain is the only person who can occupy a point by sitting in it for 20 seconds while being guarded by his team. Once one team has control over all of the map's strategic points, it then becomes their objective to kill the opposing captain to win the game.</li></ul><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">In ranked matches, players need to get kills to get experience that allow them to rank up. Upon ranking up, players will get diamonds that will help them upgrade their classes. Upon ranking up, the rank and the guns only stay with the player on ranked matches. Achievements can also be earned for ranking up appropriately.</p><h3>Classes</h3><ul><li><b>Commando</b> - A standard mid-range assault class, adept at shoot-and-run tactics.</li><li><b>Sharpshooter</b> - A long-range class with marksman weaponry.</li><li><b>Guerilla</b> - A short-range class designed for ambush tactics and close-quarters combat.</li><li><b>Rebel</b> - An explosives-focused class, well-rounded for both offensive and defensive usage of bombs and flame weapons.</li><li><b>Gunner</b> - A heavy-weapons class, highly effective when grounded in one place.</li><li><b>Saboteur</b> - A stealth-focused class that possesses silenced weapons and carries explosives.</li></ul><h3>Map Editor &amp; Sharing</h3><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8315/777662-far_cry_2_play_editor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-777662" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.62663495838288" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8315/777662-far_cry_2_play_editor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-777662"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8315/777662-far_cry_2_play_editor.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8315/777662-far_cry_2_play_editor.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>In-Editor Testing.</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Far Cry 2 features a Map Editor, which allows players to create, share, download, rate and play on customized maps using in-game tools. The map editor is not a full "SDK editor" like the UnrealEd or HAMMER, which means that it does not allow players to import custom models or images. It features most if not all of the models found in the single-player game, and it allows players to customize many of them through a "snap" system, to create elongated bridges, unique buildings, very long ladders, etc. for greater freedom of creation. The map editor also allows for heavy terrain alterations, and comes with several special tools that allow the creator to perform detailed changes to land with simplified console controls, making the editor much easier to use than the average PC editor.</p><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8315/777661-far_cry_map_editor.png" data-ref-id="1300-777661" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.62544589774078" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8315/777661-far_cry_map_editor.png" data-ref-id="1300-777661"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8315/777661-far_cry_map_editor.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8315/777661-far_cry_map_editor.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>PC Map Editor Interface.</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Maps can be made for many purposes, or one single purpose. There is a checklist in the menus of the editor that allows creators to tailor their maps to their specifications for game variants. Certain criteria must be met by the creator before the map is validated, making sure that diamond placements, capture points and spawn locations cannot be abused within measurable reason to give an advantage to one team.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Players can choose to host games and share the maps from their own hard drive, or upload the map to the central server for ratings and downloads. Each platform has its own server, so a PC user won't see a PS3 user's maps. Players can search for a specific map name, sort by size or recommended player amounts, date added, rating, etc. There are also server-created "Highest Rated" lists and "Most Popular" lists. Ubisoft Montreal also maintains an "Ubisoft Recommended" list, where it promotes maps that it finds to be exceptional. Ubisoft updates the week periodically, but the Highest Rated/Most Popular list changes daily using server statistics.</p><h2>Additional Content</h2><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/23298/1299854-far_cry_2_collectors_edition.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1299854" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.51320754716981" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:51.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/23298/1299854-far_cry_2_collectors_edition.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1299854"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/23298/1299854-far_cry_2_collectors_edition.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/23298/1299854-far_cry_2_collectors_edition.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Collector's Edition.</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0"><b>L</b><b>imited (GameStop Pre-Order) Edition &amp; Collector's Edition</b></p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Anyone who pre-ordered Far Cry 2 at Gamestop was automatically signed up (at no extra charge) to receive the "limited edition" of the game.

The player can also switch to First Person View at any time to assess the surrounding area, to nail a more precise shot, or to move around.</p><p style="">Unlike previous MGS games, MGS4 is broken down into a number of acts, each with a different setting. In between acts are mission briefings, which take place on <a href="/otacon/3005-150/" data-ref-id="3005-150">Otacon's</a> ship the Nomad. These briefings are interactive, allowing the player to change camera angles and control the <a href="/metal-gear-mk-ii/3005-1663/" data-ref-id="3005-1663">Metal Gear Mk. II</a>, and can also be viewed again from the main menu. A new chunk of the game must be installed to the hard drive before each act - these installs are not cumulative and must be performed every time the game is replayed. The August 2012 patch allows all data to be installed at once.</p><h3>New Equipment</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17388/1419318-180px_old_snake.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1419318" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.56111111111111" data-width="180" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 180px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17388/1419318-180px_old_snake.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1419318"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/17388/1419318-180px_old_snake.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/17388/1419318-180px_old_snake.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Can you see me?</figcaption></figure><p style=""><b>OctoCamo:</b> A new optical <a href="/">camouflage</a> which allows Snake to blend into any background in a matter of seconds, rendering him invisible even to the infrared cameras mounted on the unmanned <a href="/gekko/3015-1556/" data-ref-id="3015-1556">Gekko</a> Mechs. This is similar to the camouflage feature from MGS3, but OctoCamo works automatically, without needing to be adjusted from a menu. Special camo can be manually equipped, however, and patterns can be saved for future use. Extra patterns can be downloaded from the Extra menu. FaceCamo becomes available later and has additional preset variations that can replicate someone else's face. The player can unlock various <a href="/ai-companion/3015-143/" data-ref-id="3015-143">NPC's</a> faces to wear including <a href="/otacon/3005-150/" data-ref-id="3005-150">Otacon</a> and <a href="/colonel-campbell/3005-839/" data-ref-id="3005-839">Campbell</a>. Unfortunately, the FaceCamo headscarf is not unequipped during cutscenes, hiding Snake's face and ruining the dramatic experience.</p><h4><a href="/metal-gear-mk-ii/3055-4794/" data-ref-id="3055-4794"><b>Metal Gear MK.II</b></a></h4><p style="">A small, mobile, remotely operated terminal developed by Otacon. The Mk.II is equipped with stealth capabilities and is suited mainly for scouting and reconnaissance, but can also knock opponents out with an electric shock, carry Snake's gear, and also serves as the <a href="/codec/3015-2355/" data-ref-id="3015-2355">Codec</a>. Late in the game, the Mk. II is destroyed and subsequently replaced by the Metal Gear Mk. III, which is functionally identical but has a different paint job.</p><h4><b>Solid Eye</b></h4><p style="">Another device developed by Otacon, the Solid Eye combines the capabilities of binoculars, night-vision goggles, and thermal goggles into one device, worn like an eye patch. Moreover, the Solid Eye amplifies the data collected from Snake's five senses and projects it onto Snake's field of vision. It tells Snake where the enemy is and how stable or unstable things are in battle, while also letting Snake know how easy he is to spot.</p><h4><b>iPod</b></h4><p style="">Snake is equipped with an iPod Classic which he can use to listen to music while he sneaks across the battlefield. New songs can be collected throughout the game, and downloaded from the Extra menu.</p><h3>Psyche Gauge &amp; Stress</h3><p style="">Similar to the Stamina gauge from MGS3, the psyche gauge represents Snake's psychological well being, which has a direct effect on his performance. The psyche gauge can be refilled with certain healing items such as noodles, while other items temporarily increase the rate at which it is replenished. The major effect of a low psyche gauge is that it will severely hamper Snake's ability to aim accurately.</p><p style="">Snake's stress level is represented by a number that appears below the psyche gauge. The stress level is affected by many factors, such as adverse weather conditions, carrying too much equipment, or Alert Phases. High stress levels can have detrimental effects on the psyche gauge and combat effectiveness.</p><h3>Weapons</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17388/1419319-images__2_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1419319" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.358024691358" data-width="81" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 81px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:135.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17388/1419319-images__2_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1419319"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/17388/1419319-images__2_.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/17388/1419319-images__2_.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Drebin</figcaption></figure><p style="">As with all the games in the Metal Gear Solid series, the weapons play a large part of the game. The game features a massive variety of weapons ranging from handguns, sub-machine guns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, shotguns, rocket launchers, grenade launchers, and explosives. Each individual gun has its own characteristics including power, weight, range, <a href="/close-quarters-combat/3015-865/" data-ref-id="3015-865">CQC</a> compatibility, firing modes, and more. A Virtual Range option on the main menu allow the player to practice firing their acquired weapons at VR targets. It's similar in presentation to the VR training modes of previous MGS games but freeplay, rather than mission-based.</p><p style="">Weapons taken from defeated enemies are ID-locked, forcing the player to find a method for removing this lockout feature. In MGS 4, this is handled via <a href="/drebin-893/3005-474/" data-ref-id="3005-474">Drebin</a>. Every weapon that Snake comes across is immediately translated to Drebin points, representing its current world value in the theater of war during a given day. The more violent the conflict in the world, the more Drebin points the player receives. Players can then use these points to unlock these collected weapons for their use, or can save their points up to purchase ammunition or items in Drebin's shop, such as laser sights, hand grips and flashlights. These additional items can improve the accuracy or stability of a weapon, improving its effectiveness in combat. The Mk.II acts as your conduit to Drebin, automatically converting any weapons into Drebin Points while saving the ammunition for Snake.</p><h2>2.0 Patch</h2><p style="">On July 12, 2012 it was announced that MGS4 would finally receive it's long-awaited Trophy patch, as part of the Metal Gear 25th Anniversary celebrations. The 516MB patch (version 2.0) was released in all regions on August 6, 2012 and is pre-installed on retail discs going forward. 34 <a href="/playstation-trophies/3015-198/" data-ref-id="3015-198">Trophies</a> have been added to the game, though a brand new, post-patch save file must be started in order to earn them. Saves created with this patch are marked with "(Ver.2)" and are incompatible with unpatched copies of MGS4.</p><p style="">The main menu now features an "Install" option, which allows players to choose from a number of installation options:</p><ul><li><b>Individual Act Install:</b> As in the original release, each act installs over the previous one.</li><li><b>Cumulative Install:</b> The mid-game installs still happen, but they don't overwrite the previous one, meaning prior acts can be replayed without installing again.</li><li><b>Full Install:</b> Installs all the acts (approx. 8.5GB) at once, eliminating mid-game installs entirely.</li><li><b>Delete Data:</b> Removes any installed game data from the hard drive.</li></ul><p style="">In addition, Metal Gear Online has been removed from the main menu, as the service has been shut down. If any previously-downloaded MGO patches are detected, they will be automatically cleared from the hard drive.</p><h2><b>The Beauty and the Beast Unit</b></h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/101014/1435012-300px_beautybeastunitmgs4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1435012" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.59" data-width="300" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 300px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:59.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/101014/1435012-300px_beautybeastunitmgs4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1435012"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/101014/1435012-300px_beautybeastunitmgs4.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/101014/1435012-300px_beautybeastunitmgs4.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Beauty and the Beast Unit</figcaption></figure><p style="">The game's primary bosses are the <a href="/beauty-and-the-beast-unit/3015-3710/" data-ref-id="3015-3710">Beauty and the Beast Unit</a> (BB Corps), a group of female cyborg soldiers who suffer from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.

Naomi goes on to say that, before that, the virus would mutate and Snake would spread the virus around, basically becoming a biological weapon. Then, Naomi is kidnapped and Laughing Octopus, the first member of the BB Corps attacks Snake. After defeating her, he goes on to escape the area with Drebin and his Armored Personnel Carrier.

She explains that the remains of <a href="/big-boss/3005-475/" data-ref-id="3005-475">Big Boss</a> were in the possession of Big Mama (<a href="/eva/3005-1029/" data-ref-id="3005-1029">EVA</a>). When Snake goes to the European country where Big Mama was he meets up with Meryl. Meryl tries to dissuade Snake from continuing on, insisting that his time is over. Snake disagrees and proceeds to find Big Mama who reveals herself to be his surrogate mother through the Les Enfants Terribles project. They are then attacked by Liquid's PMC and they escape on EVA's motorcycle. When it crashes, Snake fights and defeats the second member of the BB Corps - Raging Raven.</p><p style="">Big Mama then shows Snake where Big Boss's remains are, but Liquid defeats Snake in CQC and takes it. Liquid is confronted by U.S. Military forces, but uses their nanomachines against them through SOP, and throws Big Bosses remains into a fire.

Liquid escapes with Naomi, but Otacon sneaks the MK.II onto the boat with them.</p><h4><b>Act Four (Twin Suns)</b></h4><p style="">Otacon and Solid Snake later receive a transmission from the MK.II revealing Liquid's plan to destroy and replace the <a href="/the-patriots/3015-2032/" data-ref-id="3015-2032">Patriot</a>'s AI Core with <a href="/metal-gear-rex/3055-3542/" data-ref-id="3055-3542">Metal Gear REX</a>'s nuclear capabilities so that he could control everything.

When he reaches the Metal Gear, the nuclear weapon has been removed and <a href="/vamp/3005-945/" data-ref-id="3005-945">Vamp</a> attacks Snake. However, Raiden steps in and fights Vamp while Snake fights off dozens of suicide Gekkos. Raiden kills Vamp, and Naomi reveals that nanomachines were keeping both her and Vamp alive all this time and that she has been close to death for a long time. She, then, disables her nanomachines, thus, ending her own life. Snake and Raiden then split up to find Liquid and pilot Metal Gear REX out of the facility.</p><p style="">Snake finds Liquid, who is now piloting <a href="/metal-gear-ray/3055-3540/" data-ref-id="3055-3540">Metal Gear RAY</a>, and they have a Metal Gear battle that ends up destroying both Metal Gears. Liquid then reveals the legendary Outer Haven, a submersible warship which he plans to use to fire the warhead from. He uses Outer Haven to try and ram Solid Snake, but Raiden cuts off his own arm and stalls Liquid, allowing Snake to escape. The act ends when the <a href="/mei-ling/3005-4903/" data-ref-id="3005-4903">Mei Ling's</a> ship The SS Missouri fires upon Outer Haven. Liquid attempts to destroy the SS Missouri, but as it is an older ship it is immune to SOP, and causes Liquid to retreat.</p><h4><b>Act Five (Old Sun)</b></h4><p style="">The act begins with Snake and others aboard the Missouri, which uses Outer Haven's need to surface to fire the nuclear weapon to get Snake aboard the vessel. Countless FROGs and the remaining BB Corps member - Screaming Mantis are all defeated by Snake on the way to stop Liquid, accompanied by Meryl. A brief appearence from Psycho Mantis is seen after, then Meryl and Snake are attacked by FROGs. Meryl urges Snake ahead as she and Johnny, who is revealed to not have nanomachines, hold off the FROGs and reveal their love for each other.</p><p style="">Snake is aided by Raiden who holds off even more FROGs as Snake has to enter a hallway of microwave emitters which heavily burn Snake. He collapses inside the room containing the Patriots AI Core. Otacon's new MK.III uploads a virus created by Naomi which she called FOXALIVE. To their surprise, a message from Naomi plays and explains that FOXALIVE stops everything from halting the war economy and activity to destroying all of the AI cores and stopping the Patriots completely. Snake then realizes that he has one more goal - to stop Liquid Ocelot. Snake and Liquid fight in hand-to-hand combat and Snake defeats Liquid once and for all.</p><h4><b>Act Six (Naked Sin)</b></h4><p style="">This act, being more of an epilogue, contains no gameplay and is all cutscenes. In it, Meryl and Johnny get married and Meryl accepts <a href="/colonel-campbell/3005-839/" data-ref-id="3005-839">Campbell</a> as her father, and Raiden reunites with his family. Meanwhile, Old Snake stands at the grave of Big Boss and attempts to kill himself with a pistol in his mouth. However, at the very last second, he pulls the gun out of his mouth and fires the shot away from himself, unable to go through with ending his life.</p><p style="">Just then, Big Boss appears, having waited to see what Snake would do. He is accompanied by <a href="/major-zero/3005-476/" data-ref-id="3005-476">Major Zero</a>, now one hundred years old and in a vegetative state, and he tells Snake that the remains that Big Mama had were of Solidus Snake. Big Boss explains to Snake that none of this was his original intention. All of the nanomachines, and AI cores were misconstrued and used in evil ways that Solid Snake had stopped. Big Boss then tells Snake that he will end the last piece of the Patriots by killing Zero, and he removes his life support. He also tells Snake that the nanomachines that Drebin gave Snake killed the mutated virus and stopped Snake from becoming a biological weapon, and that he is glad that Snake's will to live was too strong to let him kill himself. However, Drebin's injection also contained a new strain of FOXDIE, which was what really killed Big Mama and Liquid Ocelot in the end, and which Big Boss has now deliberately exposed himself to. Big Boss dies peacefully on the grave of the Boss, his own mentor, and Snake vows to live the rest of his life in peace; to see the new age off.</p><h2>Camouflage</h2><p style="">In Metal Gear Solid 4 Snake has OctoCamo, but also has the option of equipping different disguises similar to those in <a href="../../metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater/61-18082/" rel="nofollow">Metal Gear Solid 3</a>.

Developed by <a data-ref-id="3010-2404" href="/ubisoft-bucharest/3010-2404/">Ubisoft Romania</a>, H.A.W.X. takes place in a world where private military companies are growing ever more powerful. As these PMCs g row, a global conflict breaks out, and one of the largest PMCs attacks the <a data-ref-id="3035-396" href="/the-united-states-of-america/3035-396/">United States</a>. In this game 50 <a data-ref-id="3055-910" href="/airplane/3055-910/">planes</a> will be available to the players to use in aerial combat. The game will feature four-player co-op mode in the campaign, which players will be able to jump in and out at anytime during the game. The multiplayer will support 16 players battling online to gain in-game money or experience to invest in new weapons and equipment. The developers added an Enhanced Reality System, which gives the player access to anti-crash system, <a data-ref-id="3015-3542" href="/radar/3015-3542/">radar</a>, incoming missile detection, damage control system, weapons trajectory control, and the option to command your AI wingmen .</p><p style="">Each target you destroy in the game will add to your experience total; the player may level up 40 times in the game, and at each level it will unlock new single player <a data-ref-id="3015-4011" href="/campaign/3015-4011/">campaign</a> missions, new aircraft, and new weapon systems to specific aircraft in the hangar. Experience can be earned both in the single-player campaign as well as the multiplayer mode of the game.</p><h2>Campaign</h2><p style="">The campaign in HAWX is 18 missions long, and follows the story of the pilot Major David Crenshaw. The player will begin the game flying for the <a data-ref-id="3035-396" href="/the-united-states-of-america/3035-396/">United States</a> and particitipating in a mission to assist the <a data-ref-id="3025-557" href="/ghost-recon/3025-557/">Ghost Recon</a> team down on the ground in Juarez, <a data-ref-id="3035-249" href="/mexico/3035-249/">Mexico</a>. Shortly thereafter the HAWX Squadron is decommissioned from the <a data-ref-id="3030-656" href="/usaaf-united-states-army-air-force/3030-656/">United States Air Force</a> and is eventually contracted with the Private Military Company, Artemis. Artemis is in the business of warfare, taking contracts from different nations and companies to defend, escort, or destroy opponents to their interests; the HAWX Squadron is there to carry out those missions. The story is relatively diverse and will take the player into various situations all around the world, and for different services.</p><p style="">The campaign is set between <a data-ref-id="3030-270" href="/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-advanced-warfighter-2/3030-270/">GRAW 2</a> (the first mission in HAWX is at the same time as the last mission in GRAW 2) and before the events of <a data-ref-id="3030-20739" href="/tom-clancys-endwar/3030-20739/">Endwar</a> (The game makes mention of the joint US - EU missile shield). The game also makes mention of some of <a data-ref-id="3025-556" href="/tom-clancy/3025-556/">Tom Clancy Universe</a> organisations like <a data-ref-id="3015-3230" href="/national-security-agency/3015-3230/">Third Echelon</a>.</p><h2>Aircrafts</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id="3055-4529" href="/mikoyan/3055-4529/"><b>Mig-29 Fulcrum</b></a> - Built by the legendary MIG corporation in the late 1970's the Mig-29 is a generation 4 fighter that is a remarkably versatile and effective multi-purpose aircraft. Well built and relatively inexpensive it is utilized in the air forces of nearly 30 countries around the world. In addition to having a powerful engine that can propel the Mig-29 to top speeds of almost Mach 2.3 the <a data-ref-id="3055-4529" href="/mikoyan/3055-4529/">Mig-29</a> and its derivatives are one of the most agile aircraft in the world. In fact, until the advent of Thrust vectoring enabled aircraft in the 2000's the Mig-29 could outperform in close combat any warplane that was currently in service.</li><li><a data-ref-id="3055-4529" href="/mikoyan/3055-4529/"><b>Mig-33 Super Fulcrum</b></a> - The super Fulcrum is a more advanced export version of the Mig-29</li><li><b>Su-35 Super Flanker</b> - The Superflanker is a generation 4.5 long range heavy multi role fighter built by Russia. Unlike the western system of adding a number to designate aircraft evolutions, the Russians rename their planes as newer models are produced. As such the Su-35 is the final evolution of the legendary Su-27 series of planes that were originally built by the USSR. This model is considered to be close cousin of the Indian airforce's SU-30 MKI that is considered by many experts to be one of the most advanced and potent weapon system on the planet.</li><li><b>Su-37 Terminator</b> - The terminator was an experimental plane built to study thrust vectoring. For all practical purposes it is an SU-27 that has been modified with thrust vectoring engines.</li><li><b>Su-47 Berkut</b> - The Su-47 was originally conceived in the early 1980's to the next generation of fighters in the soviet air force. However, after the collapse of the USSR, the Su-47 was made into an advanced technological demonstrator. Its unique feature is its forward swept wings which gives it exceptionally good performance in sub-sonic speeds.</li><li><b><a data-ref-id="3055-5296" href="/f-16-fighting-falcon/3055-5296/">F-16 FIGHTING FALCON</a></b> - Built in the 1970's the generation 4.0 Falcon remains to date the most popular western aircraft ever built, with around 4400 exported to foreign countries. The falcon is considered to be a multi purpose aircraft and it has an impeccable service record. The aircraft has been constantly upgraded over the passage of time and remains a very versatile and effective platform.</li><li><a data-ref-id="3055-4283" href="/f-22-raptor/3055-4283/"><b>F-22 RAPTOR</b></a> - The raptor is the world's first and only Generation 5.0 Fighter and it optimizes the USAF's dominance of the sky. Built with stealth in mind, the aircraft is capable to fighting its way into heavily defended areas and then fighting its way out of there. Although much of its specifications are classified, it is regarded as the best fighter in the world by many aviation experts.</li></ul><ul><li><b><a data-ref-id="3055-5297" href="/f-35-lightning-ii/3055-5297/">F-35 LIGHTNING II</a></b> - The Lightning-2 takes the venerable F-16 platform and the heavier F-22 and incorporates many of their best features. Designed to replace the F-16, it is a single engine STOVL capable aircraft. While not as advanced as its more expensive cousin, the Raptor, the F-35 is still considered to be a generation 5.0 aircraft.</li><li><b><a data-ref-id="3055-4531" href="/eurofighter-typhoon/3055-4531/">Eurofighter Typhoon</a></b> - Built by a consortium of European countries, the Eurofighter is a twin engined, generation 4.5 aircraft. It is considered by many experts to be the best 4.5 gen fighter and its performance has been compared very favorably to the F/A-18, F-16 and even the Generation 5.0 Raptor. Like many of the recently produced aircraft, the Typhoon is capable of Supercruising; where the aircraft is capable of supersonic flight without the use of Afterburners, saving considerable amount of fuel.</li></ul><ul><li><b>JAS-39 Gripen</b> - The latest aircraft to come out of Saab, the Gripen is a key compeitor to the Typhoon and shares many features with its European cousin.

The idea is to allow artistic freedom by improving the engine's handling of textures - they can be any size or resolution, and it will have no impact on engine performance. The only limitations remaining are storage on the disc/hard drive, and the artist's imagination. This takes away the struggle between realism and performance'.</p><p style="">While this is one major selling point to developers, the engine is also being designed with cross-platform capabilities in mind, at least as far as the platforms it's being released on. This means that a developer could compile their game for <a href="../../playstation-3/93-1463/" rel="nofollow">PS3</a>, and then immediately compile another version for the <a href="../../xbox-360/60-20/" rel="nofollow">Xbox 360</a>, and then another for Windows, without ever needing to change any of the assets, code, etc. This also works for Mac OS X and Linux - and because the engine is OpenGL 2 and DirectX 9 compliant, it will work on versions of Windows before Vista as well.</p><p style="">id Software has traditionally focused on providing a solid, stable, and highly scalable engine, while all content creation tools were designed from a technical standpoint, and with less focus on the artist's job. <a href="../../id-tech-4-engine/92-1383/" rel="nofollow">id</a> <a href="../../id-tech-4-engine/92-1383/" rel="nofollow">Tech 4</a> (the engine used for <a href="../../doom-3/61-14537/" rel="nofollow">Doom 3</a>) had all of its development tools built in the game executable to allow for real time editing, but it still possessed the beauty-to-performance tradeoff that made beauty passes such a headache. However, for id Tech 5, id will introduce "id Studio", a real-time collaborative editing platform (thus far only planned for release on Windows). While it resembles <a href="../../crytek-gmbh/65-268/" rel="nofollow">CryTek's</a> Sandbox Editor in function, the premise of id Studio is that more than one editor can work on the same level collaboratively. Given the engine's texturing capabilities, it can be best described as bringing a few friends over to work on a <a href="../../lego/62-448/" rel="nofollow">Lego</a> set together, except replacing Lego with clay and paint.</p><h2>Version differences</h2><p style="">At QuakeCon 2008, <a href="../../id-software/65-347/" rel="nofollow">id Software</a> announced that they would shy away from the traditional digital distribution method that the studio usually use for their games. Also, the <a href="../../xbox-360/60-20/" rel="nofollow">Xbox 360</a> version of Rage may have to be divided into 2 discs or suffer from serious compression compared to the other versions. The final release would in fact see three discs in the Xbox 360 version.</p><p style=""><a href="/john-carmack/3040-4576/" data-ref-id="3040-4576">John Carmack</a> went on to note that the game was originally going to feature several wastelands, but the limitations of the 360's DVDs required the developer to cut them down to two. These changes were made for all versions of the game. Carmack also stated that the game might be a " little blurry" in parts for the Xbox 360, due to compression. This is necessitated by storage issues, because even with multiple discs, the Xbox 360 version will have to downgrade its graphics slightly to fit onto the DVDs. This is of course compared to the PC version, which does not have that limitation when the right hardware is available.</p><p style="">However, it was also announced that Rage would take full advantage of current generation consoles and run at <a href="../../60-fps-on-consoles/92-3223/" rel="nofollow">60 frames per second</a> on both the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360.</p><p style="">The mentioned iPad and iPhone versions of the game were published in 2010. The game is totally different from the final game for PC, <a href="/xbox-360/3045-20/" data-ref-id="3045-20">XBOX360</a> and PS3 as it is an on-rails shooting experience within the Rage environment using several Rage monsters. The Rage app was also a prototyping project of ID to show the world what mobile devices were capable of.</p><h2>Engineering</h2><p style="">The player has the ability to build items out of the various scraps that can be found around the wasteland. Some of these items can be purchased from the various vendors in the game, but some can only be found in certain areas of the game. The majority of the schematics can be purchased while a select few have to be acquired though completing missions or exploration of the wasteland. Below is a list of all the items that can be built in Rage, the advanced builds replacing the standard ones.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Items</th><th>Required</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Authority Augmenter</td><td>Nanotrite Conduit(2), Electrical Wire Kit, Feltrite Coupler, Feltrite Power Pack</td></tr><tr><td>Regenerative Infusion</td><td>Bandages, Comet Bloom(2), Vial of Blueshine</td></tr><tr><td>Advanced Sentry Turret</td><td>Ordnance Pack, Turret Barrel, Nanotrite Conduit, Small Battery Pack, Electrical Wire Kit</td></tr><tr><td>Advance Sentry Bot</td><td>Ordnance Pack, Nanotrite Conduit, Small Battery Pack, Electrical Wire Kit, Hardware Packet</td></tr><tr><td>Advanced Wingsticks</td><td>Steel Blades, Hardware Packet, Electrical Wire Kit</td></tr><tr><td>EMP Grenade</td><td>Electrical Wire Kit, Feltrite Power Pack, HE Grenades(3)</td></tr><tr><td>Dynamite Bolts – Crossbow Ammo</td><td>Steel Bolts(6), Explosive Pack</td></tr><tr><td>Mind Control Bolts – Crossbow Ammo</td><td>Steel Bolts(12), Explosive Pack, Ghost Toxin, Mutant Adrenal Gland(2)</td></tr><tr><td>Advanced RC Bomb Car</td><td>Explosive Pack, Nanotrite Conduit, Small Battery Pack, RC Car Kit</td></tr><tr><td>Pop Rockets – Shotgun Ammo</td><td>Buckshot(16), Explosive Pack</td></tr><tr><td>Fat Mamas – Pistol Ammo</td><td>Fatboys(12), Explosive Pack</td></tr><tr><td>Apophis Infusion</td><td>Desert Spore(2), Bandages, Night Blossom(2)</td></tr><tr><td>Lock Grinder</td><td>Electrical Wire Kit, Hardware Packet, Small Gears</td></tr><tr><td>Adrenaline Overdrive</td><td>Bandages, Night Blossom, Mutant Adrenal Gland</td></tr><tr><td>Bandages</td><td>Cloth Rags, Antiseptic Formula</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Racing</h2><p style="">Driving is the main way the player will traverse the wastelands in Rage, and said wastelands are hostile places. Filled with bloodthirsty bandits and the vicious Authority, the cars in Rage are heavily weaponized, equipped with guns, rocket launchers and have strong defensive capabilities too, such as shields, friendly turrets and mines. Apart from the ATV, the cars can be customized in regards to the tires, engines, armor and how much boost they can store. Below is a list of the class types for the vehicles and the weapons and defenses that are in the game.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Car name</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><b>Jetter - ATV</b></td><td>This will be the first vehicle players acquire, a simple ATV that cannot be customised in any way. The player can’t use the defence items while driving this either.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Dune Buster - Buggy</b></td><td>This is gained by completing an early story mission and be equipped with one weapon at a time, which has to be switched out at the garage.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Cuprino - Truck</b></td><td>This is also gained by completing a story mission, has far more durability than the buggy and can be equipped with two weapons simultaneously. Players can also fit custom bumpers to the front, that deal heavy damage when driving at high speed.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Monarch – APC</b></td><td>This is the only vehicle that isn’t obtained through a story mission, when talking to Redstone in Subway town, he advises the protagonist to get a stronger vehicle to fight the authority. Players must go and speak to the racer on the bottom floor of the town, beat him in the race and the Monarch is available. The main difference this vehicle has is the addition of the pulse cannon, which is a devastating energy weapon that deals massive damage to vehicles. Like the Cuprino, players can equip armor and a rammer on the front.</td></tr></tbody></table><p style=""><b>Weapons</b></p><table><thead><tr><th>Weapon</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Miniguns</td><td>Standard dual mounted miniguns that can store a very large amount of ammo. They are not effective for taking down armoured vehicles, such as the Cuprino and Monarch.</td></tr><tr><td>Rocket Launchers</td><td>These fire homing rockets that take down most un-armoured vehicles in one shot. There is a short delay for lock-on targeting, but line of sight firing is possible.</td></tr><tr><td>Pulse Cannon</td><td>A single shot weapon that has a significant cool down between each shot. Especially effective at taking down armoured vehicles. This can be only fitted to the Monarch.</td></tr></tbody></table><p style=""><b>Defence Items</b></p><table><thead><tr><th>Item</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Shield</td><td>Provides complete protection from all damage taken by the player's vehicle. Has a limited time of use.</td></tr><tr><td>Armour Restore</td><td>Completely repairs all damage that the player's vehicle has taken.</td></tr><tr><td>Drop Mine</td><td>Stationary mine that will detonate upon contact with any vehicle, even the player's verhicle.</td></tr><tr><td>Aftershocker</td><td>Sends out a powerful shockwave that will blast away all vehicles in a given radius around the player.</td></tr><tr><td>Hover Turret</td><td>A small friendly turret will hover above the player's vehicle and automatically target hostile targets.</td></tr><tr><td>Escort Bomb</td><td>Deploys an RC bomb car that will follow players and detonate near hostile targets such as cars and turrets.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Easter Eggs</h2><p style="">Rage has quite a few Easter Eggs in it many of which reference other id Software games. Many of the id references come in the form of special items around the world that can be sold for large amounts of money.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/138407/1999107-2011_10_20_00001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1999107" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/138407/1999107-2011_10_20_00001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1999107"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/138407/1999107-2011_10_20_00001.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/138407/1999107-2011_10_20_00001.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><ul><li>In one of the levels there is a reference to "Rage 2" and "Doom 5".

If players go through the door which is at the start of the vault by a flaming barrel, then players will enter a room with a portal on the ground. Upon going through the portal, players end up in the original level from the shareware version of Doom. In the level is an item that can be picked up called "Doom Marine Bobblehead" it is the same one that is on Dan Hagar's dashboard.</li><li>When players first enter the Gearhead base there is a bandit sweeping the floor and whistling a tune that is just shy of being "Whistle While You Work".</li><li>In one of the first quests, players can access a room that resembles a cell block from the Wolfstein 3-D.

Rather video card drivers produced by <a href="/nvidia-corporation/3010-6345/" data-ref-id="3010-6345">nVidia</a> and particularly <a href="/ati-technologies-inc/3010-5494/" data-ref-id="3010-5494">ATI</a>/AMD resulted in excessive graphics and compatibility issues that for some rendered the game unplayable. John Carmack implemented features that were not yet fully supported by the video card drivers, and that resulted in major problems with texture popping and blinking character models. ATI/AMD released an updated driver the same day in order to improve performance and compatibility. Bethesda released within a week a patch to set display settings like texture size and vsync to cope with the problems. Both efforts resulted in solving most of the problems reported for the PC.</p><h2>Inaccurate Product Placement</h2><p style="">On August 28th, 2011 AMC's Breaking Bad inexplicably featured a two minute scene with a character playing the then-unreleased Rage as a <a href="/rail-shooter/3015-320/" data-ref-id="3015-320">rail shooter</a> (which it is not).</p><h2>PC System Requirements</h2><p style="">Below are the official PC system specifications that Bethesda announced on their blog in September 2011.</p><h3>Minimum</h3><ul><li><b>OS</b>: Windows XP SP3, Windows Vista, Windows 7</li><li><b>Processor</b>: Intel Core 2 Duo or AMD Equivalent</li><li><b>Memory</b>: 2 GB</li><li><b>HDD Space</b>: 25 GB</li><li><b>Video Card</b>: Geforce 8800, Radeon HD 4200</li></ul><h3>Recommended</h3><ul><li><b>OS</b>: Windows XP SP3, Windows Vista, Windows 7</li><li><b>Processor</b>: Intel Core 2 Quad or AMD Equivalent</li><li><b>Memory</b>: 4 GB</li><li><b>HDD Space</b>: 25 GB</li><li><b>Video Card:</b> Gefore 9800 GTX, Radeon HD 5550</li></ul><p style="">Rage also uses Steamworks and feature <a href="/steam-achievements/3015-3280/" data-ref-id="3015-3280">Steam Achievements</a>, VOIP (Voice over Internet Protocol), and Friends Support.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>20672</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/2080541-box_rage.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/2080541-box_rage.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/2080541-box_rage.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/2080541-box_rage.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/2080541-box_rage.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2080541-box_rage.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/2080541-box_rage.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Rage]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>29</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-16/]]></api_detail_url><id>16</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: M]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-37/]]></api_detail_url><id>37</id><name><![CDATA[PEGI: 18+]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-34/]]></api_detail_url><id>34</id><name><![CDATA[CERO: Z]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-5/]]></api_detail_url><id>5</id><name><![CDATA[BBFC: 15]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2011-10-04 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/rage/3030-20672/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[Guitar Hero 4

World Tour adds <a data-ref-id="3055-1271" href="/drums/3055-1271/" slug="drums">drums</a> and vocals to the game, the former featuring a drum kit constructed specifically for use with this new release. The Guitar Hero drum set features three pad-based triggers, two raised cymbal-like triggers, and one kick pedal trigger. Both the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 version have basic compatibility with Rock Band instruments. However, unlike in Rock Band, you cannot use a <a data-ref-id="3055-3669" href="/headset/3055-3669/" slug="headset">headset</a> to sing vocals.</p><p style="">Guitar Hero: World Tour's soundtrack includes songs from Van Halen, Linkin Park, The Eagles, Sublime, <a data-ref-id="3040-56559" href="/lenny-kravitz/3040-56559/" slug="lenny-kravitz">Lenny Kravitz</a>, and more. Unlike previous Guitar Hero games, there are no cover songs in the game--every track is from the original artist. The game also has a music studio mode where players can construct new tracks. It supports online play for many of its modes such as band career mode, where the player can recruit friends to form a band and play online or on the same console and fight other bands in a new Battle of the Bands mode. It also allows players to complete the single-player career mode as any of the four instruments. To encourage families playing together a new "Easy Rhythm" difficulty has been added so that parents can play with their kids. This mode removes the necessity to worry about hitting the correct fret or drum pad and instead just focuses on having the player strum or hit a pad at the right rhythm.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/597/181057-instruments.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-181057" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/597/181057-instruments.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-181057"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/597/181057-instruments.jpg"></a><figcaption>Guitar Hero: World Tour instruments</figcaption></figure><p style="">There are several new gameplay addition new to Guitar Hero (and to full band games in general). For the bass guitar there is a new open strum note, effectively a "sixth button" to make bass more interesting. Like a bass pedal kick, this is signified on-screen by a horizontal line across the fretboard. Drums have "sustained" cymbal notes, which act as cymbal rolls without the precision required of drums rolls. Drums are also be able to activate starpower by hitting both cymbals at the same time at any point during a song. There are also drums notes that one must hit with above average force to gain maximum points, taking advantage of the velocity sensitive drum pads. Lead Guitar has tapping sections like <a data-ref-id="3025-567" href="/rock-band/3025-567/" slug="rock-band">Rock Band</a>, that can be performed on both the normal fret buttons or the slide strip. Lead Guitar also has multiple sustained notes that can started at different times, like those in DDR. In full band mode, the Band shares a maximum starpower pool, but be able to activate starpower separately.</p><h2>Setlist</h2><p style="">As a part of a pre-order bonus for Guitar Hero: World Tour, Gamestop gave away a <a data-ref-id="3015-237" href="/cheat-code/3015-237/" slug="cheat-code">cheat code</a> for the game that unlocked every song in the game.

It was</p> <figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/296/189778-socom_headset.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-189778" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.66640625" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:66.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/296/189778-socom_headset.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-189778"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/296/189778-socom_headset.jpg"></a><figcaption>Headset included with in-store purchase.</figcaption></figure><p style="">released as a download through the PLAYSTATION Store and as a Blu-Ray disc either with an official PLAYSTATION 3-branded BlueTooth headset or as a standalone product. In SOCOM: Confrontation, you can take sides in either the Commandos (which also feature Special Ops), or the Mercenaries. It is the only game that has the rights to the <i>NAVY</i> symbol and title (U.S. Navy SEALs). Although it is not officially endorsed by the SEALs, the developers to get help from former SEALs in order to get a sense of how the SEALs communicate, what guns they use more frequently, and the clothing they wear.</p> <h2>Setting</h2> <p style="">Several of the maps featured in this game will be based in Algeria, North Africa. The levels have been scaled down significantly from those in the last two previous games in the series (console games, not portable games), since the developers wanted to create a more intimate combat experience. Vehicles have also been excluded from the game for this reason. Some of the confirmed classic maps in SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs Confrontation are:</p> <ol><li><b>Crossroads</b> </li> <li><b>Desert Glory</b> </li> <li><b>Frostfire</b></li> </ol>     Along with these three maps, four others confirmed are new maps, featuring:<br /><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2167/257377-2634185545_fca6328f1b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-257377" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.562" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2167/257377-2634185545_fca6328f1b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-257377"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2167/257377-2634185545_fca6328f1b.jpg"></a><figcaption>The map "Quarantine".</figcaption></figure><ol><li><b>Urban Wasteland</b><b><br /></b> </li> <li><b>Quarantine</b> </li> <li><b>Kasbah</b></li> <li><b>Fallen</b></li> </ol>     All the seven maps can be played with seven different modes a player can choose from, such as:<br /><ol><li><b>Suppression</b> - <i>The team which has the most people alive after a round is over wins the round.</i> </li> <li><b>Elimination</b> - <i>One team needs to kill everyone in the opposing team in order to win, or else the round is a draw.</i> </li> <li><b>Extraction</b> - <i>The Commandos will need</i> <i>to save hostages captured by the Mercenaries and extract them while the Mercenaries need to do all they can to defend the hostages.</i> </li> <li><b>Escort</b> - <i>A set of VIPs that spawn with the Commandos will need to be escorted by them from one point to another. During this escort, the Mercenaries are going to try and kill the VIPs, so Commandos need to prevent that from happening</i>. </li> <li><b>Demolition</b> - <i>The Commandos will need to take a bomb and plant it in the Mercenary base while the Mercenaries need to stop this from happening.</i> </li> <li><b>Control</b> - <i>A set of control points will need to be captured by each side. Whichever side has the most control points captured by the end of the round wins.</i> </li> <li><b>Breach</b> - <i>Using C4 charges, Commandos will need to blow a set of gates in order to breach enemy territory.</i> <i>Once this is done, a bomb that the Commandos have with them will need to be planted in order to fully destroy the Mercenary stronghold.</i></li> </ol><br /><h2>Features</h2> <p style="">SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs Confrontation will include 32-players per game maximum, ranked and custom unranked games, customizable weapons, and proximity chat, where the enemy can hear the player's team conversations if they are nearby. Whatever is said while wearing the headset is relayed to the world in Confrontation regardless if the "Talk" button has been pressed. The levels will also have some items destructible, such as cars. The equipment the character wears will affect his mobility, along with his/her stats.</p> <h3><br /></h3> <h3>Customization</h3> <p style="">SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs Confrontation has customizable maps, weapons, and characters. The maps can be customized to any size to accommodate the number of players, so they are not always so large if you want to play with a small group of people. The weapons can have attachments, with primary weapons (assault rifles, machine guns, sniper rifles) accepting a maximum of two attachments, while secondary weapons (pistols) accepting only one attachment. Lastly, player can create their Commando and Mercenary from the ground up, giving them their own, unique look.</p> <figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/438/216039-00271836.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-216039" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.55333333333333" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:55.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/438/216039-00271836.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-216039"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/438/216039-00271836.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/438/216039-00271836.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Character Creator.</figcaption></figure><h3><br /></h3> <h3>Lobby System</h3>The lobby system is making a return in SOCOM: U.S Navy SEALs Confrontation, with players being able to choose the games they want to play instead of a matchmaking system doing it for them if they so wish. Games in the lobby system are divided by Briefing Rooms. Each Briefing Room can hold a total of 256 players, and in these rooms, a server list displays all the current games running a player can join. Players can join ranked, or custom unranked games from here. Ranked games can be created by a player, but options for the game come from a pre-set playlist in order to prevent cheaters from changing gameplay options to gain a higher rank at an alarming rate. Unranked games are fully customizable. <br /><br /><h3>Matchmaking System</h3>Along with a lobby system, SOCOM: Confrontation also comes with a standard matchmaking system, where those that want to find a quick game can jump in and do so. This matchmaking system works just like any other, giving the user to choose options such as game modes, maps, etc. <br /> <br /><h3>Tournaments </h3>SOCOM: U.S Navy SEALs Confrontation now has a tournament system where players can register to participate in tournaments as a team or as a free agent. Teams are separate from clans and if players do not create one or request to join one they will be automatically assigned to a team before the start of the tournament. Tournaments are accessed through the ingame calendar. When a player is successfully registered into a tournament he/she will be contacted automatically via an ingame message and will receive a game invite 10 minuets before the start of the match.  <br /> <br /><h3>Clan Ladders<br /></h3>Clans can now participate in the clan ladder, where ranked clans can challenge those who are ranked above them and be challenged by those below them. Participation in the clan ladder is up to the clan leader and when ladder matches are accepted the game will automatically schedule the match and send pre-game messages and game invites. When the match is over, if the lower ranked clan wins they switch places with the higher ranked one, if the higher ranked clan wins they keep their spot thus defending their place on the ladder.<br /> <br /> <br /><br /><h3><br /></h3> <h2>Clans</h2>Clans have always been a big thing in the SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs franchise. In this title, the clan system will be completely revamped. Rosters can have up to 64 players. Games can be scheduled via an in-game scheduling system. A clan calendar will also be available where members can check events they have during that time, including clan wars. Each clan will have a special emblem they can create, which will go directly on your soldier. Clans also have the ability to assign Special Operations Forces.<br /><h2>Special Ops<br /></h2>In SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs Confrontation, a player can choose from any five Special Ops to play as, such as:<br /><ol><li>U.S. Navy SEALs (SEALs, United States of America) </li> <li>Special Air Service (SAS, United Kingdom) </li> <li>Kommando Spezialkräfte (KSK, Germany) </li> <li>Unidad de Operaciones Especiales (UOE, Spain) </li> <li>1er  Régiment Parachutiste d'Infanterie de Marine (1er RPIMa, France)</li> </ol>     These Special Ops will have special weapons and equipment that is not available to others, corresponding to where they're from.<br /><br /><h2>SOCOM.com</h2>Slant Six Games is planning on using their web site, <a href="http://socom.us.playstation.com/" rel="nofollow">     SOCOM.com</a>, to allow the player to log in via their PLAYSTATION Network ID and check many things, such as their clan calendar, roster, rank, leaderboards, and much more. Currently,  SOCOM.com acts as a blog where Slant Six posts the latest content they have to their fans. Due to the importance of the game's server issues however, SOCOM.com lacks many of the features planned. Slant Six has commented that these features in addition to many of the features that don't appear in the game currently will be added soon.<br /><br /><h2>Server Issues</h2>At it's launch on October 14, 2008, Confrontation suffered from problems with online connection and stability issues.  The game also lacked many of the features promised on the game box and detailed in the game manual.  The game's developer, <a data-ref-id="3010-6288" href="/slant-six-games/3010-6288/">     Slant Six</a><a data-ref-id="3010-6288" href="/slant-six-games/3010-6288/">      Games</a>, has issued a number of downloadable patches since the games release to both address the online issues and add-in game features.  With the the most recent release, patch 1.41 (released to coincide with Confrontation's European launch), the gaming experience with SOCOM: Confrontation continues to improve; online play is lag-free generally and now includes almost all promised (and much requested) features such as a configurable party system for joining games and indication of your friends in-game location in the XMB. <br /> <br /><h2>Cold Front DLC<br /></h2> Cold Front is the first DLC available for SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs: Confrontation, and was released on Dec. 17, 2009. It's debut price was $9.99 until after Dec. 20, and now it costs $14.99 to download as the first price was exclusive for the first three days.  <br /> <br /><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/66248/1271786-4015833349_f6fe9e752b_o.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1271786" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/66248/1271786-4015833349_f6fe9e752b_o.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1271786"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66248/1271786-4015833349_f6fe9e752b_o.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66248/1271786-4015833349_f6fe9e752b_o.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption> New Special Forces, Russian Spetsnaz in the new Area of Operation </figcaption></figure><ul class="plain-list"><li>New Eastern Europe/Russia Area of Operation</li><li>New snow setting with detailed effects </li><li>New snow gear along with new camo for Mercenaries and Special Forces     </li><li>New Thermal vision scope</li><li>New gameplay mode, ARMS RUN.</li><li>Five new maps: Three old remade (Vigilance, Blizzard, Night Stalker)</li></ul>                                    : Two new (Uprising, Entrapment) <br /><ul class="plain-list"><li>New Special Forces squad, Russian Spetsnaz</li><li>Gun Turrets placed throughout maps</li><li>New music for new maps</li><li>New weapon customization that allows you to pick two weapon types to upgrade and unlock special attachments and weapons in the specific class</li><li>Three all new weapons along with two new attachments, as well as the specialization attachments</li><li>Fleashbang and Smoke now available for the grenade launcher</li><li>New PSN Trophies for the DLC<br /></li></ul>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>20676</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/1789974-box_socomcon.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/1789974-box_socomcon.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/1789974-box_socomcon.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/1789974-box_socomcon.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/1789974-box_socomcon.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1789974-box_socomcon.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/1789974-box_socomcon.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs - Confrontation]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>5</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-16/]]></api_detail_url><id>16</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: M]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2008-10-14 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-88/]]></api_detail_url><id>88</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation Network (PS3)]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-network-ps3/3045-88/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3N]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/socom-us-navy-seals-confrontation/3030-20676/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[Soul Calibur IV

Players have access to three different kinds of attacks: a horizontal slash, a vertical slash, and a kick. Each of these attacks can be performed at three different levels: high, medium, or low. Mixing up the height and type of attack to get around an opponent's guards/dodges is the key to winning. This gameplay style could be seen as similar to Tecmo's <a data-ref-id="3025-135" href="/dead-or-alive/3025-135/">                  Dead or Alive franchise</a>. Players also have a block button. Pressing the analog stick in different directions will let the player block either high and medium attacks or medium and low attacks.<br /><br />Blocking player's attacks has a little more complexity than other fighters such as <a data-ref-id="3030-15743" href="/mortal-kombat/3030-15743/">                  Mortal Kombat</a>. If players block for too long, an icon (which can be seen next to the player's life bar) will slowly change from blue to green to red to flashing red. If a player's icon is flashing red, one more strong attack will send the player into a state of "Soul Crush", stunning them for a few seconds. Once in a state of Soul Crush, the opponent can press all four face buttons on the controller (block, horizontal attack, vertical attack, and kick) to engage a critical finish, instantly killing the player. This system encourages players to not play a totally defensive game, as too much defense could lead to a Soul Crush and defeat.<br /><br />Players have a number of tactical options, however, to turn a well timed block into a powerful offensive assault. By pressing the analog stick or D-pad towards the opponent while hitting the block button, the player can engage a "guard impact" which will deflect the incoming attack and leave the opponent open for a split second-plenty of time to lay down a few powerful, uninterrupted attacks. Players can also "repel" a weapon attack and thrust it away from the player. This manoeuvre gives the defensive player even more time to hit an opposing player while they try to reorient themselves in combat. <br /><br />Every character in Soulcalibur IV has high, medium, and low  armor. A powerful attack to one of these areas could cause the armor to break, increasing damage caused to that area of the body. Broken armor will shatter in the middle of battle, changing the appearance of the character without stopping the flow of battle.<br /><br /><h2>Character Creation      </h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5370/1700661-sciv_character_creator.png" data-ref-id="1300-1700661" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5370/1700661-sciv_character_creator.png" data-ref-id="1300-1700661"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5370/1700661-sciv_character_creator.png"></a><figcaption> The character creation system.</figcaption></figure>       The character creation system promises to be similar to that found in <a data-ref-id="3030-9855" href="/soul-calibur-iii/3030-9855/"> <i>Soulcalibur III</i></a>, though in <i>Soulcalibur IV </i>the types of clothes and armor the player equips will have an effect on his or her performance in battle. Players choose from a "style" used by one of the main <i>Soulcalibur </i>fighters, which effectively means that the player chooses a move set of one of the regular characters in the series. Once a style and character sex has been chosen, players can automatically generate a character based on a few specific stats (whether the character has regular, heavy or light armor, a focus on attack, defense, HP or skills, and whether the character is good or evil.<br /><br /> Players can also choose to create their fighter from the ground up in the edit mode. Edit mode lets players choose from a number of different facial, hair, and body types, as well as different voices for their character (which can be modulated in pitch to sound higher or lower). Most importantly, players can choose from a number of different armors and accessories to equip onto their character. These accessories will increase or decrease the amount of attack, defense, or HP a character has, adapting the character for any number of single player or online challenges. <br /><br /><h2>Returning Characters</h2> A number of characters installments in the series return in <i>Soulcalibur IV</i>. The game also features several newcomers and bonus characters.<br /><br /><h3>Returning:</h3> <ul class="plain-list"><li> <a data-ref-id="3005-2325" href="/amy/3005-2325/">

Standard Edition. The Premium Edition includes: an art/comic book, a white T-shirt for the 360 version or a black T-shirt for the PlayStation 3 version, a Tournament Kit that will give people the chance to keep a record of their battles against their friends, and exclusive access to extra Create a Soul content.<br /><br /><h2>Downloadable Content<br /></h2>Many videos have leaked onto the internet, showing Yoda fighting Darth Vader. Also, in both versions of the game, there is an empty character slot that is impossible to unlock. This has led many to speculate that Darth Vader and Yoda are eventually going to be up for download on the opposing consoles. That wish came true when Namco Bandai announced Yoda being downloadable on PS3 along with Darth Vader on 360 for 400 Microsoft Points (five dollars on PSN) on October 23, 2008. The fact that the opposing characters are on-disc DLC makes <i>Soulcalibur IV</i> one of the more infamous examples of developers nickel-and-diming their customers through DLC.<br /><br />At the end of July, almost immediately after its release, <i>Soulcalibur IV</i> saw a host of <a data-ref-id="3015-329" href="/downloadable-content/3015-329/">                  DLC</a>, though only one pack which could be applied to gameplay. The Customization Equipment pack was made available for 100  Microsoft Points or $1.49 on <a data-ref-id="3015-1643" href="/playstation-network/3015-1643/">                  PSN</a>, and included goodies for returning characters Sophitia (who was given an armor pack) Astaroth, Yoshimitsu and Voldo (whose old head models were made available. Also released were 17 tracks from the original game's OST, which were also made available for individual sale. They were made available for 1200 Microsoft Points for the pack, or 80 Microsoft Points per track and $14.99/$.99 each on the PlayStation Network.<br /><br />August saw the next DLC costume pack dubbed the 'Maid Pack'. Costing 200MS on the Xbox Market place, you unlock perverted French Maid items for your female custom character. These items include 2 types of aprons, another French maid top, a maid headdress and a maid skirt.<br /><br /><h3>PS3 Japanese Version</h3>The Japanese version is almost completely identical to the US release. If your PS3's language settings are set to English, all text and menus in the game will appear in English as well. No need to import a US copy if you are living overseas.  <br /><br /><h2>Soundtrack<br /></h2>Disc One <br /> <table class="t-editor with-border full-width"><tbody><tr><td>1.</td> <td>"DISTANT

style="">Saints Row 2 is a crime-themed, mission-based, open world game that looks to continue evolving the over-the-top gameplay formula of its predecessor. With many comparisons to the <a href="/grand-theft-auto/3025-6/" data-ref-id="3025-6"> GTA</a> series, it is no surprise that Volition have chosen to take the game in this direction to individualize it and perhaps gain an identity outside of all those comparisons. Saint's Row 2 has the player work his way through a vastly improved <a href="/stilwater/3035-161/" data-ref-id="3035-161"> Stilwater</a>, a 150% larger version of the city with new areas including a prison island, a power plant, suburbs, and some underground sections, dispensing of rival gang members and otherwise unruly denizens to reclaim the turf and respect his once lofty gang has lost.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11670/270705-plane_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-270705" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11670/270705-plane_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-270705"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11670/270705-plane_2.jpg"></a><figcaption>A wide variety of vehicles can be used, including biplanes. </figcaption></figure><p style=""><i>Saint's Row 2</i> boasts many of the same features of the first game such as diversions (known as 'Activities'), as well as a host of new features such as varying degrees of customization including complete character customization, vehicle customization, and crib customization, a revamped respect system, new vehicles including jets, speedboats, jet skis, <a href="/helicopter/3055-361/" data-ref-id="3055-361"> helicopters</a>, and <a href="/monster-truck/3055-1959/" data-ref-id="3055-1959"> monster trucks</a>, new weapons including <a href="/rocket-launcher/3055-211/" data-ref-id="3055-211"> rocket launchers</a>, shock paddles, stun guns, and <a href="/satchel-charge/3055-1415/" data-ref-id="3055-1415"> satchel charges</a>, <a href="/cooperative-play/3015-108/" data-ref-id="3015-108"> co-op</a> gameplay, and online multiplayer.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11670/270543-cannonizing.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-270543" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.56222222222222" data-width="450" style="width: 450px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11670/270543-cannonizing.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-270543"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11670/270543-cannonizing.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11670/270543-cannonizing.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Third Street Saints. </figcaption></figure><p style=""><i>Saints Row 2</i> picks up several years after the events of the first game. <a href="/the-boss/3005-8436/" data-ref-id="3005-8436"> The Boss</a>, the player's character who was thought to be dead at the end of the first game after being betrayed by his own gang members, awakes from a coma induced by a bombed yacht but is horribly disfigured. The game opens with a reconstructive surgical procedure, allowing players to freely customize the look of the player character. Upon returning to <a href="/stilwater/3035-161/" data-ref-id="3035-161"> Stilwater</a>, the lead character notices that much has changed, from building renovations that have added more high-rise buildings and apartments, to the situations that his old friends and gang members have gotten into. The player character must now deal with all of these changes and somehow restore the Row to its former glory.</p><h2>Gangs</h2><p style="">There are four gangs in Stilwater:</p><ul><li><strong><a href="/3rd-street-saints/3015-1048/" data-ref-id="3015-1048"> 3rd Street Saints</a></strong> - The player character's gang. The Saints were broken up after the events of the first game, and it's time to bring them back, stronger than ever. Their flag color is purple.</li><li><strong><a href="/the-brotherhood-of-stilwater/3015-2449/" data-ref-id="3015-2449"> Brotherhood of Stilwater</a></strong> - A gang that largely deals with violent crimes and extortion. Led by Maero. Their flag color is red.</li><li><strong><a href="/ronin/3015-2450/" data-ref-id="3015-2450"> Ronin</a> </strong>- A Japanese gang that deals with gambling and prostitution. Led by Shogo Akuji, though his father seems to really have most of the power. Their flag color is yellow.</li><li><strong><a href="/the-sons-of-samedi/3015-2451/" data-ref-id="3015-2451"> Sons of Samedi</a></strong> - A gang that deals with heavy drug trafficking. Led by "The General". Their flag color is green.</li></ul><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">The combat of Saints Row 2 is slightly different from that of other games in the genre. For starters, there is no <a href="/auto-aim/3015-145/" data-ref-id="3015-145"> lock on-targeting system</a>, with the player having to free aim. This can be accomplished by either pressing the fire button when pointed at an enemy, or the player can click in the left stick for a more accurate, "zoomed-in" aiming mode. If the player has a gun equipped, the right trigger will fire, while the left trigger will melee attack. If the player has an inventory <a href="/melee/3015-444/" data-ref-id="3015-444"> melee</a> weapon available, it can be swung with both the left and right triggers. If unarmed, the player's melee has a sort of "combo" system; if the player successfully lands three hits on an opponent, the third hit will spin the camera around and cinematically show the character performing a special attack that ground his enemy. By holding either trigger, the player can also charge up his attack, making it extra deadly. A couple of interesting features of SR2's combat are the use of environmental objects and the <a href="/human-shield/3015-176/" data-ref-id="3015-176"> human shield</a> mechanic. There are certain objects in the game that can be picked up and wielded like melee weapons, like cinder blocks or <a href="/wooden-chair/3055-1885/" data-ref-id="3055-1885"> chairs</a>. These items can be dropped however, if the player is knocked down, and are not held in the inventory like normal weapons. Also, by holding the left bumper the player can take a nearby enemy hostage as a "human shield". While having a shield, the player is virtually invincible from the front, but moves slower in return. Also, by pressing the left trigger, the player will "execute" his shield in a way specific to the weapon he is holding. There are numerous weapons that appear in Saints Row Two, which include:</p><h3>Melee</h3><ul><li><a href="/pepper-spray/3055-2485/" data-ref-id="3055-2485"> Pepper Spray</a></li><li><a

However, the customers don't like media attention or a private detective, so you must avoid them at all costs. Sometimes, the client will order you to do something, like go buy some food at Freckle Bitch's or drive around at a high speed. Play this game in co-op mode, and one of you gets to be the prostitute!</p><p style="">Rewards: Vehicle Delivery, reduced Sons of Samedi notoriety.</p><h3>Fight Club</h3><p style="">Face off against other fighters in a fighting ring or prison block. You can't use firearms, but anything thrown into the ring by onlookers can be used to bash and break your opponents.</p><p style="">Rewards: Legal Lee, Troy, Increased Melee Damage, Pumped Up.</p><h3>Fuzz</h3><p style="">Dress up as a cop and take out criminals and college students for Stilwater's hot new police reality show, Fuzz!

Be careful of the shotguns those pimps wield though.</p><p style="">Rewards: GAL 43, Infinite SMG ammo, Health Regeneration.</p><h3>Hitman</h3><p style="">In Hitman, you receive a list of targets. These targets appear as crosshairs on your map when you get in range, however, unlike in the first Saints Row, you can kill them with any weapon, which makes this one quite a bit easier.</p><p style="">Rewards: Infinite Assault Rifle ammo, Hand Grenades, Satchel Charges.</p><h3>Chop Shop</h3><p style="">In Chop Shop, you need to collect the cars that the garage wants and bring them back there.</p><p style="">Rewards: Buggy, Mechanic Discount.</p><h2>Diversions</h2><p style="">The game also has Diversions, these are random things for you to do to get some rewards and just have fun.</p><h3>Tagging</h3><p style="">Tagging has been redesigned since the last game, now you need to fill a part of the wall with paint, but you can't spray too much outside of the lines.</p><h3>General Collecting</h3><p style="">There are a few thing to collect in Saints Row 2, like CDs and other things.</p><h3>Basejumping and Skydiving</h3><p style="">Jump out of a plane or helicopter and deploy your parachute to start the Basejumping diversion.

Then go out in public and a Diversion will start that will give you a time limit to offend as many people as possible. As the levels go up, the more people you're required to offend with your nakedness.</p><h3>Ho'ing</h3><p style="">Only located in one or two spots around the city, generally at public toilet stops, strip clubs, or adult bookstores in the Red Light District.

In a guitar hero game dedicated to the band that is Aerosmith!]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2> Guitar Hero: Aerosmith is the second spin-off of the popular <a data-ref-id="3025-289" href="/guitar-hero/3025-289/">    Guitar Hero</a>  series. It is developed by <a data-ref-id="3010-1442" href="/neversoft-entertainment/3010-1442/">    Neversoft</a> and published by <a data-ref-id="3010-78" href="/activision/3010-78/">    Activision</a>, and is was released on June 29, 2008.  The game contains a story that mirrors the band's career, progressing from Aerosmith's first show at Nipmuc Regional High School in 1970 to the band's induction into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in 2001. <br /><br /> The game's six tiers are broken up by short videos featuring the members of Aerosmith talking about the importance of that tier's venue to the band (i.e., the experience of being signed at Max's Kansas City when that venue is reached). Longer versions of those videos can be purchased from the in-game store.  <br /><br /><h2>Characters</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15315/457263-gh_aerosmith___dmc.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-457263" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.70095693779904" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:70.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15315/457263-gh_aerosmith___dmc.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-457263"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15315/457263-gh_aerosmith___dmc.jpg"></a><figcaption>DMC performing Walk This Way</figcaption></figure> The playable characters include the standard characters from<a data-ref-id="3030-4031" href="/guitar-hero-iii-legends-of-rock/3030-4031/">    Guitar Hero III</a>, such as <a data-ref-id="3005-780" href="/axel-steel/3005-780/">   Axel Steel</a>, <a data-ref-id="3005-796" href="/johnny-napalm/3005-796/">  Johnny Napalm</a>, and Lars Umlaut. These characters act as the guitarists for the opening band in career mode and can only be used while playing non-Aerosmith songs. New additions are Joe Perry, Tom Hamilton, and Brad Whitford of Aerosmith. It also features DMC of Run-DMC, who takes over as the lead singer when the player plays <i>King of Rock</i> or Run-DMC's version of <i>Walk this Way</i>, as well as being a playable guitarist.<br /><br /><br /> Each character (aside from the unlockable ones) have two costumes. Each costume has a set of palette-swaps that can be purchased from the in game store, The Vault. Each palette swamp not only changes their specific costume's color, but changes certain accessories/designs as well. Aside from a few extra palette swaps, the initial characters appear in the game just as they did in Guitar Hero III.<br /><br /><u>Initial Character List</u><br /><ul class="plain-list" style="margin:0px;padding:0px;list-style-type:none;"><li style="margin:6px 0px 0px 25px;padding:0px;list-style-type:square;"><a data-ref-id="3005-780" href="/axel-steel/3005-780/">    Axel Steel</a></li><li style="margin:6px 0px 0px 25px;padding:0px;list-style-type:square;"><a data-ref-id="3005-763" href="/judy-nails/3005-763/">    Judy Nails</a></li><li style="margin:6px 0px 0px 25px;padding:0px;list-style-type:square;"><a data-ref-id="3005-796" href="/johnny-napalm/3005-796/">    Johnny Napalm</a></li><li style="margin:6px 0px 0px 25px;padding:0px;list-style-type:square;"><a data-ref-id="3005-798" href="/izzy-sparks/3005-798/">    Izzy Sparks</a></li><li style="margin:6px 0px 0px 25px;padding:0px;list-style-type:square;"><a data-ref-id="3005-806" href="/xavier-stone/3005-806/">    Xavier Stone</a></li><li style="margin:6px 0px 0px 25px;padding:0px;list-style-type:square;"><a data-ref-id="3005-794" href="/lars-umlaut/3005-794/">    Lars Umlaut</a></li><li style="margin:6px 0px 0px 25px;padding:0px;list-style-type:square;"><a data-ref-id="3005-813" href="/casey-lynch/3005-813/">    Casey Lynch</a> </li><li style="margin:6px 0px 0px 25px;padding:0px;list-style-type:square;"><a data-ref-id="3005-817" href="/midori/3005-817/">    Midori</a></li></ul><br /><u>Unlockable Characters (Purchased in The Vault)</u><br /><ul class="plain-list" style="margin:0px;padding:0px;list-style-type:none;"><li style="margin:6px 0px 0px 25px;padding:0px;list-style-type:square;"><a data-ref-id="3005-3551" href="/joe-perry/3005-3551/">    Joe Perry</a></li><li style="margin:6px 0px 0px 25px;padding:0px;list-style-type:square;"><a data-ref-id="3040-89849" href="/tom-hamilton/3040-89849/">    Tom Hamilton</a></li><li style="margin:6px 0px 0px 25px;padding:0px;list-style-type:square;"> Brad Whitford </li></ul><br /><br /><h2>Notable inclusions</h2><br /><br /><i>Guitar Hero Aerosmith</i>, while being poorly received by gaming press, included many first and lasts for the Guitar Hero franchise. It has been the only entry in the series to incorporate five band members on stage (Singer, Guitarist, Rhythm-Guitarist, Bassist and drummer) opposed to the standard four (sans rhythm-guitarist) usually implemented since the original. This was done to have all five members of Aerosmith be shown on stage at once. As a result, Neversoft had to program new camera angles and shots to compliment this change. To fill the fifth spot for the opening band, a new fictional NPC band member was created, the female rhythm guitarist. This would be her only appearance in the entire series thus far.<br /><br />  Musically, this was the first Guitar Hero to include a rap/hip hop song on the setlist, found in Run-DMC's  <i>King of Rock. </i>It was also the last game in the series to have a set-list that included covers. One feature that future GH iterations would note is the fact that all songs included on disc are master-tracks. While Guitar Hero: Aerosmith does include a majority of master recordings, four of the non-Aerosmith songs are still covered.<br /><br /> As well as Guitar Hero: Aerosmith having the only appearance of female rhythm guitarist, it was also the last console game to feature the non-playable band first introduced in the original. Throughout the Guitar Hero franchise, playable characters were accompanied by a specific NPC singer, bassist, drummer and occasionally key-board player. These characters would stop appearing come the release of  <i>Guitar Hero World Tour</i>, although the male singer/drummer make a cameo appearance during the game's opening cinematic.  <br />   <br /><h2>Track Listing</h2> <h3>Tier 1: "Getting the Band Together" (Nipmuc High School)</h3> <ul class="plain-list"><li>1.

Along the way, the created player will face off real-world NBA stars like Dwight Howard and Kobe Bryant in a variety of basketball challenges. </p> <p style="">The foundation of NBA Ballers is its trick system, which allows players to combo together ball handling moves to baffle opponents and clear the way to the basket. As moves are accomplished, a meter fills that allows for even more outlandish moves, including a level three "shut 'em down" move that ends the game if performed. </p> <p style="">Chosen One has a sense of hip-hop style to it, with all of the instrumental background music being provided by well-known producer Just Blaze, and full-motion video sequences that feature Public Enemy frontman, Chuck

However, Atari confirmed that the North American Xbox 360 version is to be region free, meaning Europeans with Xbox 360s can import the game.</p><p style="">If you pre-ordered the game at Gamestop you received a Ghostbusters T-shirt and a downloadable in game 'flight suit'.</p><p style="">A demo was released for the game on the PlayStation Network on July 9, 2009.</p><h2><b>Story</b></h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12154/249673-gbps2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-249673" data-size="small" style="width: 284px" data-ratio="1.7781690140845" data-width="284" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:177.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12154/249673-gbps2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-249673"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/12154/249673-gbps2.jpg"></a><figcaption>An example of artwork from the PS2/Wii version of Ghostbusters: The Video Game</figcaption></figure><p style="">The game's story was written by <a href="/dan-aykroyd/3040-89702/" data-ref-id="3040-89702">Dan Aykroyd</a> and <a href="/harold-ramis/3040-99985/" data-ref-id="3040-99985">Harold Ramis</a>, who played Ray Stanz and Egon Spengler respectively and co-created the Ghostbusters series. Aykroyd has gone on-record as saying that the game is, effectively, Ghostbusters III. Many of the key cast members from the films reprised their roles in likeness and in voice. One notable exception to this is Rick Moranis who refused to come out of retirement to reprise his role as accountant Louis Tully. As a result, Louis is said to be on vacation during the events of the story. Sigourney Weaver also refused to be a part of the game because she did not feel that the script lived up to the two movies. She later changed her mind and said that it was a worthy follow up, but by then it was impossible to write her into the game.</p><p style="">The game puts players in the role of a <a href="/rookie-ghostbusters/3005-17202/" data-ref-id="3005-17202">new recruit</a> to the Ghostbusters team, just as <a href="/manhattan/3035-1613/" data-ref-id="3035-1613">Manhattan</a> is overrun with supernatural monsters.

There is also an overheating mechanic where your pack will overheat after firing for a long time, and it will not work for a few seconds (players can press a button to vent off the pack releasing the heat manually); there is a temperature meter on the back of the pack so players can keep track of things.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11423/869540-004.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-869540" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11423/869540-004.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-869540"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11423/869540-004.jpeg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11423/869540-004.jpeg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The P.K.E meter</figcaption></figure><p style="">The P.K.E Meter is used in combination with the googles (this changes the game to a first person perspective) to track <a href="/ectoplasmic-goo/3055-3525/" data-ref-id="3055-3525">ectoplasmic</a> activity and P.K. energy.

The money can be spent on various upgrades such as a slam-dunk ability to trap ghosts faster, better scanning etc.</p><p style="">When players run out of health they will go down, but can be revived by the other members of the Team (AI can also go down and be revived as well).

The co-op here takes place in areas seen in the single-player game.</p><p style="">The game offers several modes:</p><ul><li><strong>Instant Action:</strong> Players can test their mettle in a variety of Job Types across a selection of 12 different maps to see if they've got what it takes to be a true Ghostbuster.</li><li><b>S</b><strong>urvival:</strong> Survive a paranormal onslaught</li><li><strong>Containment:</strong> Capture all the ghosts</li><li><strong>Destruction:</strong> Eliminate mysterious artifacts to prevent spawning ghosts</li><li><strong>Protection:</strong> Protect Egon's devices</li><li><strong>Thief:</strong> Save the artifacts from being stolen by ghosts</li><li><strong>Slime Dunk:</strong> Dunk the most Slimers</li></ul><h2>SD Version</h2><p style="">The Standard Definition versions of Ghostbusters the Video Game (Wii, PS2, and PSP) share the same overall story as the HD version, but with a radically changed art style and level designs. The player still plays the role of the Rookie, but can now select the Rookie's sex at the start of the game. The game has the same level progression, but each level has been completely redesigned. The New York Streets portion of level 2 was removed, and the architectural office was replaced with a game design studio, complete with electronic sprite ghosts. The fight against a possessed Alyssa in the Museum was replaced with a fight against a skeletal T-Rex. The Collector was changed from a knight in armor to a massive toothy worm, and the Black Widow changed from a thin white woman to a heavyset black woman.</p><p style="">Gameplay-wise the slamming mechanics of the HD version were removed, and instead trapping a ghost requires the player to follow a set of directional prompts displayed onscreen. The game has no currency or upgrade system, but completing 50% and 100% of the Spirit Guide will both reward health boosts. As a bonus, and on the Wii version only, it is possible to play the game's entire story mode in co-op.</p><h2>System Requirements</h2><p style=""><b>Minimum System Requirements</b></p><ul><li>OS:

This time around she'll be going on an adventure to find the sacred Mayan underworld of Xibalba in Southern Mexico.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Set mostly in Southern Mexico around Chiapas, <a href="/lara-croft/3005-195/" data-ref-id="3005-195">Lara Croft</a> sets off to uncover the lost Mayan underworld of Xibalba through use of portals located on our world. The Mayan legend holds that their 300-day calendar year included five extra missing days, days in which, according to legend, the portals opened. It is Lara's task to open the portal once again.</p><p style="">In Underworld, Lara Croft and the environment she explores look much better due to a new graphics engine, and the gameplay itself has been revamped. Interaction with the environment is of special note. If Lara's knees become muddy from crouching the rain will soon wash it away. Lara also pushes through foliage with her hands and leaves footprints in the ground, she is able to destroy parts of the environment, and the people and animals she kills remain where they died.</p><p style="">Other additions to this Tomb Raider installment include a new melee combat system and the ability to pick up objects even if they aren't integral to progress in the game.</p><p style="">Underworld was released on 18th November, 2008 by developer Crystal Dynamics and publisher Eidos Interactive, and was made available for PS2, PS3, PC, Xbox 360, Wii and Nintendo DS. A demo for Xbox Live Marketplace was released on October 28, 2008 at 1.3 GB along side a PC release of this demo days later. The Xbox 360 version features 6 hours of exclusive content in the form of two single-player DLC missions titled "Beneath the Ashes" and "Lara's Shadow".</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3419/783139-tru5.png" data-ref-id="1300-783139" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3419/783139-tru5.png" data-ref-id="1300-783139"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3419/783139-tru5.png"></a><figcaption>Lara Croft as she appears in Underworld</figcaption></figure><p style=""><i>Tomb Raider: Underworld</i> is a different experience than most other <i>Tomb Raider</i> games because it is somewhat open-ended, giving you the chance to explore and granting the game a less linear feel. As in most <i>Tomb Raider</i> games, <i>Underworld</i> has secrets and items to collect, so you are going to have to play the game more than once going through multiple paths to find everything.</p><p style="">In terms of action, the shooting has been revamped, so that Lara can shoot at two enemies at one time when using her pistols. It has also been noted that combat has been toned down to emphasize the adventure aspect of the game. There are no "boss battles" per se in Tomb Raider: Underworld, only larger enemies and challenges.</p><p style="">One of the key developments in gameplay has been the "giant puzzle" feature which shows the level itself acting as one continuous puzzle for Lara to solve. Developers have mentioned that a big part of the game is watching the level change around you as you solve the puzzles. Instead of a series of puzzles in succession, levels in Underworld are designed to be a mesh of puzzles fitting into a much larger idea than was at first apparent... which comes out in terms of gameplay as a series of puzzles in succession anyway.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p style=""><i>Tomb Raider: Underworld</i> is a direct sequel to the previous Crystal Dynamics games <a href="/lara-croft-tomb-raider-legend/3030-8554/" data-ref-id="3030-8554"><i>Tomb Raider: Legend</i></a>. As the game opens, Lara is making her way through a flaming Croft Manor. As Lara pushes her way through explosions and makes her way to safety, she finds her butler, <a href="/winston-smith/3005-2957/" data-ref-id="3005-2957">Winston</a> helping her technical advisor <a href="/zip/3005-2960/" data-ref-id="3005-2960">Zip</a> who is injured. Zip attempts to shoot Lara with Winston trying to hold him back. With that the game returns to one week in the past and we see Lara on her private boat in the Mediterranean sea, searching for the mystical burial place of King Arthur, named Avalon. Lara is looking for Avalon because <a href="/amanda-evert/3005-2962/" data-ref-id="3005-2962">Amanda Evert</a>, one of Lara's many attractive female nemeses, explained that <a href="/amelia-croft/3005-2961/" data-ref-id="3005-2961">Amelia Croft</a>, Lara's mother, had been transported to Avalon after pulling a sword from a stone in Nepal.</p><p style="">Upon finding a temple of 'Proto-Norse' origin, Lara comes to believe that due to the similarities between the English myth of Avalon and the Norse myth of Niflheim being so strong (in reality, the myths have almost nothing in common), that they are merely different cultures interpretations of the same place. Upon further searching the temple under the sea, she finds a gauntlet, supposedly that which the Norse god Thor worn. However, Lara is knocked out by a team of mercenaries under Amanda's hire and abandoned to die in the temple. Lara however, chases down the mercenaries to their ship and climbs aboard where she finds Amanda speaking with another enemy of Lara's; <a href="/jacqueline-natla/3005-2954/" data-ref-id="3005-2954">Jacqueline Natla</a>, who is held captive. As Lara listens to them talk, she learns that Avalon is in fact the same as Helheim the Norse <a href="/hell/3035-24/" data-ref-id="3035-24">Hell</a>, rather than Niflheim, and that no-one will be able to enter Helheim without Mjöllnir; Thor's Hammer. Due to an explosion caused by Lara fighting a mercenary, the ship begins to sink. As Lara escapes, she sees Amanda fleeing and shoots at her. Amanda throws the gauntlet into the water and Lara dives in after it, losing Amanda, but saving the god's gauntlet.</p><p style="">After inexplicably making her way to coastal <a href="/thailand/3035-30/" data-ref-id="3035-30">Thailand</a>, Lara learns that her late father, Richard Croft had already done extensive studying on the subject of Helheim and had gotten to the second gauntlet years ago, hiding it in a disguised crypt beneath Croft Manor. Finding the gauntlet (as well as a map to Thor's belt) Lara returns to the surface to find her mansion in flames. Lara makes her way through Croft manor only to be shot at by Zip who explains that Lara shot him and stole Amanda's 'Wraith Stone' from a vault. Lara and Winston explain to Zip that it wasn't Lara who shot Zip, asserting that Lara would have no need to burn down her own mansion and as Lara tells Winston and Zip to get out of the building, she herself goes to check the security feed in the computer room. Upon reaching the computer room, Lara catches a glance at her reflection in the glass wall, noting it looks somehow different. Suddenly, Lara understands that she isn't looking at her reflection, but a perfect doppelgänger of herself on the other side of the glass. As Lara and the doppelgänger fight, <a href="/alister-fletcher/3005-2963/" data-ref-id="3005-2963">Alister</a> makes his way into the room, trying to escape the flames, but is shot by the doppelgänger. Lara attempts to shoot her copy, but she escapes too quickly. Carrying Alister out of the burning manor, it is determined that he is dead and Lara stands, more determined than ever to find Mjöllnir, stating that she needs Thor's hammer to kill a god; Natla.</p><p style="">Making her way to Mexico, Lara finds Thor's belt and as she puts it on, Thor's gauntlets power up, giving her the ability to handle Mjöllnir as soon as she finds it. She makes her way to Jan Mayen Island, finally finding Mjöllnir, where she also finds a message from Thor's father Odin, explaining a ritual needs to be undertaken in order to open the gates to Helheim.</p><p style="">With Thor's belt, hammer and gauntlets Lara makes her way to the sister ship of the vessel she sank earlier, where Amanda is once again holding Natla. Murdering all the guards on the ship with Mjöllnir, Lara confronts Natla. Soon after, Amanda and the doppelgänger appear, but the doppelgänger throws Amanda down a shaft. Natla claims to know the ritual that will open Helheim and agrees to help a wary Lara who proclaims that when Natla makes a wrong move, Lara will kill her. With the help of Natla, Lara opens the gateway to Helheim, deep beneath the Arctic Sea. Eventually, Lara finds Amelia, her mother who has been turned into a thrall, a deceased person or creature that continuously reanimates due to a substance called eitir. Lacking any mind, memory or real conciousness to speak of, Amelia approaches Lara, but Lara coldly and mercilessly guns her down, saying that she was not her mother, and that her mother died a long time ago. After Amelia's death, Natla makes the ridiculous claim that everything up to that point had been orchestrated by Natla to allow her access to Avalon, though it had already been stated that this was not Avalon. She also explains that her first attempt failed years ago when Richard Croft, Lara's father, refused to help her, so Natla killed him.</p><p style="">As Lara goes to strike Natla with Mjöllnir, the doppelgänger appears and restrains Lara. Natla leaves Lara to the doppelgänger, who attempts to kill Lara, but is suddenly disabled by Amanda, who of course wasn't really dead. Amanda realises that the world is in danger and holds off a number of incoming thralls so that Lara can defeat Natla.</p><p style="">When Lara reaches Natla, she is operating a titanic device called the Midguard Serpent, which is designed to bring about the Seventh Age, triggering apocalyptic levels of volcanic activity throughout the world. As Lara steadily destroys the device with Mjöllnir, Natla tries to stop her, but to no avail. With the destruction of the Midgard Serpent imminent, Lara hurls the hammer at Natla which strikes her and sends her hurtling down into a sea of etir.</p><p style="">As Lara regroups with Amanda, they find the exit is blocked and that there is no discernible way out. Lara, however finds a sword like Excalibur embedded in a rock, next to a portal identical to the one that transported Amelia to Helheim in the first place and determines that if they were to pull the sword out, they would be returned to Nepal. However, the portal is broken and Lara determines that the only way for them both to escape is for Lara to hold the Portal steady and for Amanda to pull the sword, with the two of them touching hands at the last moment to both be transported.</p><p style="">As Lara and Amanda find themselves in Nepal, they state that they are even. As Amanda leaves, Lara says goodbye to her mother, walking away from the portal as the game ends.</p><h2>Controversy</h2><p style="">Shortly before the release of the game, a representative of the Eidos PR company Barrington Harvey caused outrage when he made several comments referring to review scores of Tomb Raider: Underworld.</p><p style="">The news broke when a GameSpot UK employee left a Twitter post explaining that Eidos had asserted that any reviews of the game with a score lower than eight out of ten were not to be posted online or in print until after Monday, November 24th. When a journalist for Videogaming247 called Barrington Harvery, they shockingly received an honest answer: an employee acknowledged the review ban and admitted that Eidos was attempting to manage reviews in order to make the game's Metacritic rating higher and not put people off buying the game.</p><p style="">At the time, OXM UK and Eurogamer had each put up their reviews of the game, both of which stood at 7.0, an act which the representative asserted had caused problems. The Metacritic score stood at 78 and has since dropped to 77.</p><p style="">Although the act of managing review scores is not particularly uncommon in the games industry, it is particularly rare for a representative of such a firm to admit to it as the role of managing review scores is seen by all as dishonest. The news spelled bad news for Eidos who had previously been accused of pulling strings to get <a href="/jeff-gerstmann/3040-89712/" data-ref-id="3040-89712">Jeff Gerstmann</a> fired from his job at GameSpot over a 6/10 review of their game <a href="/kane-lynch-dead-men/3030-19874/" data-ref-id="3030-19874"><i>Kane and Lynch: Dead Men</i></a>.</p><h2>Release</h2><p style="">In the UK, Game stores offered a Limited Edition copy of the game for the same price as the standard edition. Exclusive to this release is a special bonus DVD which includes "Exclusive Behind the Scenes Documentary," "Previously Unreleased In-Game Music," "Art Gallery," "Video" and "Trailers" all bought together with the standard game disc in a cardboard packaging.</p><h3>Critical Reaction</h3><p style="">Although Tomb Raider: Underworld has received mostly positive results from critics, it has prompted suffered a few criticisms.</p><p style=""><b>GameSpot</b> offered a 7/10 review of the game, noting "<i>Excellent mix of outdoor, underground, and underwater locations</i>," but pointing out that "<i>it does little to address previous games' problems</i>," which the full review specifies as camera problems, bad dialogue, and a lack of refinement to core gameplay.</p><p style=""><b>IGN</b> went on to point out further flaws, such as object detection and combat issues, although still gave the game no lower than a 7.4/10 for the PS3.</p><p style=""><b>Nintendo Power</b> gave the Nintendo Wii version of the game a 7/10, citing the game's environments as the best in the series, but pointing out easy puzzles as a cause for concern. Combat was also described as "so obsolete that the developers needn't have bothered."</p><p style="">The game has however marveled some reviewers who have produced wildly enthusiastic reviews.</p><p style="">The United Kingdom phone network, <b>Orange</b>, produced a review of the game scoring the game at 9/10, praising the environments and Lara's reactions to them. The diminished amount of combat was noted as a positive change, claiming the main appeal was in the exploration of the worlds which come to life.</p><p style="">Although <b>The Guardian</b> newspaper noted that the camera had a tendency to go haywire, they still gave it a 4/5 review pointing out the graphics and story (going so far to refer to them as "unimpeachable") and stating that fans of the series will "<i>certainly agree that it's the best</i> Tomb Raider <i>game yet.</i>"</p><p style=""><b>Gamesradar</b> also went on to give the game a 9/10 review, mentioning that although Lara's tendency to "<i>[freak] out and [jump] off in the wrong direction</i>" happens far too often, that exemplary check-pointing and the decision to ditch boss battles pays off.</p><p style="">As of December 6th, 2010, the platform-specific rankings for each version of the game on Metacritic are as follows:</p><ul><li><b>Xbox 360</b>: 76/100</li></ul><ul><li><b>Nintendo Wii</b>: 70/100</li></ul><ul><li><b>Microsoft Windows</b>: 80/100</li></ul><ul><li><b>Playstation 3</b>: 75/100</li></ul><h2>Downloadable Content</h2><p style="">Eidos released two new chapters of Tomb Raider: Underworld as DLC for the Xbox 360 only due to an arrangement with Microsoft. Eidos did not announce any prices for the new chapters, but offered release dates. The first chapter, titled "Beneath the Ashes," was stated to be released Christmas 2008, but never arrived. The second one, "Lara's Shadow," was released March 10th, 2009.</p><h3>Lara's Shadow</h3><p style="">Lara’s Shadow allows gamers to experience Lara’s universe from an entirely new perspective: that of her evil doppelgänger. With faster movement, shadow powers, and a melee attack that decimates enemies with devastating accuracy and speed, the doppelgänger opens up new gameplay mechanics, areas and puzzles that wouldn’t be possible while playing as regular ol' Lara. Lara’s Shadow is available for 800 Microsoft Points.</p><p style="">When it was later confirmed by a reporter for MTV Multiplayer that there are no plans to produce the two new chapters for PS3 or PC, a outcry from the fans followed. An Eidos spokesperson gave a defending statement for the move: <i>"</i>Microsoft asked us how we could extend the fantastic Tomb Raider: Underworld gameplay experience for their thriving Xbox Live community and this exclusive content was the result."</p><p style="">On November 8th a jury and public vote took place on the Festival Arcadia's <i>Virtually Fashionable</i> to determine which of a number of new outfits would be made available to download over Xbox Live Marketplace. The two winning designs, produced by Québec fashion designers are to be made available at a later date.</p><p style="">Four additional costumes for Lara are available for free on the Xbox Live Marketplace. The costumes are two classic Lara Croft outfits and two types of form-fitting wetsuits.</p><h2>PC System Requirements</h2><h3>Minimum Settings</h3><ul><li><ul><li><strong>OS:</strong> XP (admin rights

play.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Proving Ground is the ninth installment of the <a href="/tony-hawk/3025-10/" data-ref-id="3025-10">Tony Hawk franchise</a>. It was developed by <a href="/neversoft-entertainment/3010-1442/" data-ref-id="3010-1442">Neversoft</a> for the PS3 and Xbox 360, by <a href="/page-44-studios/3010-3083/" data-ref-id="3010-3083">Page 44 Studios</a> for the PS2 and Wii, and by <a href="/vicarious-visions/3010-519/" data-ref-id="3010-519">Vicarious Visions</a> for the Nintendo DS. It was released in October 2007. The game world spans three large areas: Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, DC while Skate classes are broken down into Career, Rigger and Hardcore.</p><p style="">Career skaters include skateboard greats such as <a href="/tony-hawk/3040-63770/" data-ref-id="3040-63770">Tony Hawk</a>, <a href="/bob-burnquist/3005-338/" data-ref-id="3005-338">Bob Burnquist</a> and Ryan Sheckler. Rigger skaters include <a href="/bam-margera/3040-63773/" data-ref-id="3040-63773">Bam Margera</a> and <a href="/rodney-mullen/3040-63774/" data-ref-id="3040-63774">Rodney Mullen</a>, while hardcore skaters have <a href="/andrew-reynolds/3040-63776/" data-ref-id="3040-63776">Andrew Reynolds</a> and <a href="/mike-vallely/3040-63810/" data-ref-id="3040-63810">Mike Vallely</a> in its ranks. Proving ground also expanded on the Nail-the-Trick Mode from the previous game, adding Nail-the-Grab and Nail-the-Manual to the Career style.</p><h2>Character Styles</h2><p style="">Career Skater stays the truest to the esablished formula. Players collect S-K-A-T-E, enter competitions, perform tricks for an audience and so on. As a Rigger, the player will often have to create his own path to get to a specific platform.

Now set in war-torn Venezuela, the player again takes on contracts for various warring factions on a quest for payback.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Mercenaries 2: World in Flames was a 2008 release in the <a href="/mercenaries/3025-526/" data-ref-id="3025-526">Mercenaries</a> game franchise. It follows on from 2005's Playground of Destruction. The game retains its pro-explosion agenda, in spite of switching publishers from Lucasarts to EA. This was the penultimate game from Pandemic, before the studio was officially liquidated by Electronic Arts. Their final game was 2009's <a href="/the-saboteur/3030-21616/" data-ref-id="3030-21616">The Saboteur</a>.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">Mercenaries 2 retains the same explosive-enthusiast theme as the original game. However, Mercenaries 2 has more focus on destroying the environment. Building destruction is much more prevalent than in <a href="/mercenaries-playground-of-destruction/3030-7633/" data-ref-id="3030-7633">Playground of Destruction</a>, and every building in the game from small shacks to large skyscrapers and oil rigs can be brought down with the right weaponry.</p><p style="">Mercenaries 2 features pistols, unlike the first game, which contained one pistol in a cheat airdrop. WiF contains three pistols: a silenced pistol, a non-suppressed pistol, and a revolver, though the revolver is unique to one character. However no more ammo can be found out in the field for the revolver.</p><p style="">World in Flames also contains a new method of purchase as opposed to the Russian website, the Merchant of Menace, from the first game. One of the necessary components of the game is for players being able to form their own PMC (Private Military Corporation), from which they can purchase different equipment. Different members possess different abilities, and while there are only three members, they possess all the skills needed, as shown below:</p><h4><b>Eva</b></h4><p style=""> Supplies cars to the player, and allows you to purchase them. In addition, if you can find a sufficient number of spare parts, then you can have custom made cars, such as the Carracho de Muerte, which is a cross between a car and a monster truck.</p><h4><b>Ewan</b> </h4><p style="">Ewan is a helicopter pilot who was previously employed by Universal Petroleum. He can provide airdrops, as well as taking you to locations through a Fast Travel system. Ewan is considered one of the most helpful characters due to the fact you can make extremely large sums of money from exploiting one of his challenges.</p><h4><b>Mischa</b></h4><p style="">Mischa is a Russian fighter pilot, who spends more time drunk than he does in the air. According to him, he is a better pilot while intoxicated - and this may well be the case. Mischa can bomb targets using his Tupolov jet, should the player request such an action.</p><p style="">Money in Mercenaries 2 is rather easy to get in comparison to some games, such as the <a href="/saints-row/3025-386/" data-ref-id="3025-386">Saints Row</a> and <a href="/grand-theft-auto/3025-6/" data-ref-id="3025-6">Grand Theft Auto</a> series. Individual thousands of dollars aren't even shown in the game, and the smallest value is 10,000 and beyond. One of the achievements in the game is even to earn 1,000,000,000 dollars, making the character a billionaire in effect. </p><h2>Story</h2><p style="">The story in World in Flames takes place in <a href="/venezuela/3035-134/" data-ref-id="3035-134">Venezuela</a>. While working in Venezuela, you are contacted by <a href="/ramon-solano/3005-122/" data-ref-id="3005-122">Ramon Solano</a>. Ramon says that he is willing to pay a small fortune for the freedom of a captured general by the name of Carmona. His claim is backed up by the fact he is the richest man in the country, and has assets worth well over one billion US dollars. For this reason, your mercenary of choice agrees to help him with his predicament. Upon success, Carmona is returned to Solano's mansion. Unfortunately, this is where the deal turns sour. Solano refuses to pay for the mission, and pulls a gun on your character. His plan involves seizing control of the country thanks to help provided by Carmona. And in order to do this, he needs to ensure no information leaks out before he is in complete control. Unfortunately for you, this means you are going to have to be killed.</p><p style="">Before Solano pulls the trigger, your character turns and sprints away. Some Venezuelan soldiers begin to fire at your character, and as you vault from a balcony you are hit. The bullet hits your character in the rear, if you follow. With glee the game frequently references this moment. After this moment, your character decides that revenge is definitely an option to be considered. And revenge comes in no better form than blowing the hell out of the target's mansion. Therefore, the next mission you'll encounter makes you do just that. Solano's mansion is your new target, and if you can pull it off, Solano too. When in the house, the VZ troops will attack you relentlessly, until a point where one of them decides to smash an APC through a wall into the house and attempt to kill you with that instead. As expected it fails, and you take control of the APC. The damage to the mansion is severe enough that Ramon and his men pull out to another location you do not yet know. After this, the mansion becomes your new base of operations, and the locale where you will be meeting a large amount of your own PMC.</p><p style="">Venezuela has become something of a hotspot after Ramon Solano's rise to power, and as such it means that there are many different factions and elements operating in the area. To begin with, the weaker factions are met, and eventually the big players come into the area. The first faction met is Universal Petroleum, who are a massive fuel conglomerate. This faction wants Solano out in order to get back to their regular operation, which is getting oil from Venezuela's resources. The UP consist mainly of hired guns, and have ties to the United States. Other factions include the Rebels, and the Rastafarian Pirates. However, all three of these factions are small in comparison to the two big players, who will enter the fray during the second half of the game.</p><p style="">After completing contracts with different factions, you will eventually find a link. This suggests Ramon Solano's current location. He is apparently hiding in a bunker, in a mountainside. Despite the fact he's hiding away from you he is still retaining his hold on the country. One of the missions involves storming the bunker, and this simply means attacking and pushing towards the bunker. After reaching it, you will attempt to call an airstrike on it, but the bunker appears unscathed. Unfortunately the only manner in which the bunker will be damageable will be through incredibly powerful weapons: nuclear weapons. In specific, you're looking for a nuclear bunker buster. Unfortunately, such a thing is possessed only by China, and the United States. By complete luck however, both nations are operating in the area after war intensified. Working with the groups will allow you to find one who is willing to supply you with exactly what you need to complete the job. When you are leaving the bunker, Fiona calls you and pleads with you to get back to the mansion ASAP. It is being assaulted by a team of Venezuelan forces, and while she is an accurate shooter herself, she can't hold out against the sheer force of them. Upon arrival you are able to wipe out the invaders, and Fiona thanks you for returning so quickly.</p><p style="">In order to weaken Ramon's stranglehold on the nation you will need to wipe out both of his closest allies. These men are General Carmona, who you rescued at the start of the game, and Blanco. Blanco is an extremely heavily built man, and is Ramon Solano's brute force more than anything. He carries a Hunting Pistol, which is the only one of its kind in the game. Blanco happens to be aboard an oil rig, where many UP operatives and innocent workers are being held captive. The only right thing to do would be to save the day, and that is exactly what you are expected to do. Upon arriving on the rig, you are ordered to kill Blanco. Carmona is killed soon after, when you blow up the Carmona Memorial Bridge whilst his convoy is moving across it. These two deaths cause severe blows to the regime of Ramon Solano, and his army begins to weaken from this damage. Without Carmona leading them they are not as prepared for war with an inexperienced leader like Ramon.</p><p style="">China and the United States Army are both on the offensive now, and both nations have invaded the nation of Venezuela in order to liberate it for their own uses. China's aims put it in direct competition with the US, and vice versa, as both seek to grab the oil fields and shut the other country out. The Chinese army is commanded by Zhou Peng, who saw experience commanding in North Korea during the Song Initiative (he was the Chinese commander during Playground of Destruction), and they have equal equipment to the US Army. In addition, both nations request your cooperation with them, and in return they will both be prepared to offer you the equipment you need to destroy Solano: a nuclear bunker buster.</p><p style="">After completing contracts for both nations, they both request you kill the rival commander in order to wrap up the war. Otherwise, when Solano is gone the rest of the world will watch on as the battle for oil continues. Regardless of the nation selected to aid, you will receive the bunker buster required, and will be able to complete the game. Upon acquiring the nuke you need, you will access the grand finale.</p><p style="">To complete the final mission, you have to travel along a familiar route up to Solano's base. His army is crumbling, and they have almost all fallen back in a last ditch maneuver to save their leader. He is preparing to leave the country though, and allow his army to survive for themselves or surrender. The road to the bunker is massively protected, and there is a helicopter gunship floating overhead for much of the encounter unless it is destroyed or stolen. Upon reaching the base, you are given access to the MOAB: the Mother of All Bombs. Upon calling this beast in, the bunker will be ripped open, and is ripe for you to enter.</p><p style="">Inside the bunker, Ramon rushes to his escape vehicle, which is a helicopter. Your mercenary follows him into the chopper, and rather than having a final shootout, you will be prompted with different button presses instead. The pilot is shot dead during a struggle for Ramon's pistol, leaving the chopper preparing to take off without any control. As it writhes around in the air you must press the correct buttons to avoid Solano's attacks and counter with your own. However, before the chopper hits a wall and explodes you leap from it, leaving Ramon Solano to die in the explosion.</p><h2>Levels</h2><p style=""><b>Beginning</b></p><ul><li>Rescue Carmona</li><li>Moving In</li></ul><p style=""><b>Executive Operations (PMC)</b></p><ul><li>Doom Patrol</li><li>Misha Milanich</li><li>Finding Blanco</li><li>Get Solano (First Try)</li><li>Get Solano (Again)</li><li>Part One: Blast the Bunker</li><li>Part Two: Verify Solano</li></ul><p style=""><b>Universal Petroleum</b></p><ul><li>Universal Petroleum</li><li>The Devastator</li><li>Phone Tag</li><li>Altagracia Outpost</li><li>Maracaibo Airport Outpost</li><li>Cabimas Outpost</li><li>Leave No Trace</li><li>Built for Speed</li></ul><p style=""><b>PLAV</b></p><ul><li>Introduction to the P.L.A.V.</li><li>Orinoco River Outpost</li><li>Eastern Merida Outpost</li><li>Paint the Town</li><li>Jungle Cruise</li><li>Tropical Island Getaway</li><li>Corporate Headhunting</li></ul><p style=""><b>Pirates</b></p><ul><li>Central Island Outpost</li><li>Mainland Outpost</li><li>Black Market, Warm Heart</li><li>Yo-ho-ho and a Truck Full of Rum</li></ul><p style=""><b>Allied Nations</b></p><ul><li>Southern Caracas Outpost</li><li>Port of Caracas Outpost</li><li>Southeastern Caracas Outpost</li><li>Missile Command</li><li>Lost and Found</li><li>Battle for Caracas vs. China</li></ul><p style=""><b>China</b></p><ul><li>Southwestern Chumana Outpost</li><li>Caracas Estates Outpost</li><li>Southeastern Cumana Outpost</li><li>Medusplosion</li><li>Exit Strategy</li><li>Price of Gas</li><li>Battle for Caracas vs. Allies</li></ul><h2>Controversy</h2><p style=""><strong><i>Main Article:</i> <a href="/censored-version/3015-2170/" data-ref-id="3015-2170"><i>Censorship</i></a></strong></p><p style="">When Mercenaries 2 was released, the game was just as controversial as its predecessor, from three years beforehand. It was actually so controversial in Venezuela that President Hugo Chavez had the game banned. It was viewed as being so severe that Chavez accused the game of being propaganda from the United States government.</p><p style="">The Venezuelan government requested help from Irish singer Bono (frontman of U2) in order to help prevent the production of what they called the "Anti-Venezuela shooter", after Bono provided his own personal help to the people of Africa in the past. The National Assembly of Venezuela, headed by Hugo Chavez, had all violent videogames banned in 2009, and punish anyone who is caught selling them with up to five years imprisonment. Many critics felt that this was all due to the production of World in Flames.</p><h2>Box Art</h2><p style="">The box art for Mercenaries 2 was changed quite heavily from the original design that was shown in order to reach the final look. The initial design of the art showed the back of what appears to be <a href="/mattias-nilsson/3005-174/" data-ref-id="3005-174">Mattias Nilsson's</a> jacket, with the name of the game displayed on it. This art was then substituted for the current design, showing Mattias biting off the pin on a <a href="/grenade/3055-111/" data-ref-id="3055-111">fragmentation grenade</a>.</p><p style="">Along the bottom of the design it shows his name, which suggests that three boxes may have been an option, each depicting a different mercenary from the game. However, the only design ever released was that of Mattias, who is arguably the cover character for the entire series. Another plausible explanation is that the name below the character is intended to make the design look like a dollar note, seeing as all mercenaries are funded with money.</p><h2>Trivia</h2><ul><li>At the end of Mercenaries 2, Fiona suggests that the next location should be Africa or India.

Having destroyed the central Chimeran Tower in London 1951, Nathan Hale is approached by Black Ops soldiers who immediately sedate then extract him on their VTOL aircraft. Sgt. Hale is flown to a top-secret Special Research Projects Administration (SRPA) military research base in Iceland, codenamed "Igloo".  This research base is devoted to trying to reverse engineer the advanced technology of the Chimera.  It is here that Hale discovers that he is not the only individual who has not succumbed to the Chimera virus.  These individuals comprise a group known as "The Sentinels" with enhanced reflexes and combat abilities.  Soon after Hale meets the Sentinels, the Chimera learn of the existence of the American base in Iceland.  As a result, the Chimera immediately send a Goliath to attack the research base.  Hale and the Sentinels combine forces in order to repel the Chimeran offensive, and they eventually escape making their way safely back to the United States.  <br /><br />Two years later things are looking bleak for the United States.  The U.S. military is being strained by the Chimera's two-pronged invasion of the East and West Coasts.  In addition to this, the Chimera infestation has already claimed several U.S cities, including <a data-ref-id="3035-293" href="/chicago/3035-293/">      Chicago</a>.  At this point It seems that Hale and the Sentinels are the America's last hope against the seemingly unstoppable Chimeran invasion force.  Together they had just saved <a data-ref-id="3035-191" href="/san-francisco/3035-191/">      San Francisco</a> from the immediate threat  <figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/176252-tedprice.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-176252" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.95033860045147" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:95.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/176252-tedprice.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-176252"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/30/176252-tedprice.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/30/176252-tedprice.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The man, the myth, the legend...Ted Price</figcaption></figure>of invasion.  Soon after saving San Fran, the Sentinels learn of an important Chimera communications hub located in Chicago.  Thus Hale and the Sentinels pack up and head to the East Coast, where they hope a surprise attack will destroy the Chimera's presence in the U.S.  It is in Chicago that Hale encounters new Chimeran enemies like the Grim and the Leviathan.<br /><h3><br /></h3> <h3>Gameplay</h3>The gameplay in Resistance 2 is different from its predecessor in that Nathan Hale no longer acts as a "<a data-ref-id="3015-771" href="/one-man-army/3015-771/">       one man army</a>."  Rather, Hale is always accompanied by fellow Sentinel members (Hale belongs to the sub-set of the Sentinels known as Echo Team).  Because of this change, the player will now encounter new situations that encourage squad work.  Hale's teammates also serve as a vehicle to relate critical information to the player.  They constantly update Hale with news from the home front and they each have their own individual personalities and back stories that are developed as the game progresses.  Weapons The player should also notice changes within Hale throughout the game.  <a data-ref-id="3040-89560" href="/ted-price/3040-89560/">      Ted Price</a> was quoted as saying "Hale is still fighting the [Chimeran] virus.  He's resistant, but only to an extent."  Thus, it is assumed that Hale will undergo a change of some kind during the course of the campaign.  Price is also quoted as saying that the changes Hale undergoes and his fate are both "creepy developments."   <br /> <br /><h2>Chimera<br /></h2>  The Chimera enemy from the original Resistance: Fall of Man are much of the same. As in they are an alien/human hybrid species [Alien Zombie Disease], this means that they are NOT alien but are in fact humans infected with an alien disease, Even the games end boss Daedalus was originally a human by the name of Adam Shepard infected with "Pure Chimera" dna. They're bodies have 12 times the metabolism which results in their healing abilities however increases their body heat to explosion level, so any Chimera breed that has regenerative health also has some form of heatstack on their back. Currently there are 42 known Chimera Breeds, which are the following; <br /><ul class="plain-list"><li>Advanced Hybrid - The advanced hybrid looks like the regular hybrid though it is a little faster, stronger, and uses the Bullseye Mark II weapon.</li> <li>Angel </li> <li>Boiler </li> <li>Brute </li> <li>Burrower </li> <li>Carrier </li> <li>Chameleon- Chameleons are mid-sized chimera with the special ability of being invisible. The only way to tell they are coming is to hear for their footsteps.</li> <li>Cocoon </li> <li>Crawler </li> <li>Fury - Furies are strictly water based creatures. They are extremely fast and extremely deadly. The key is to not land into water with furies in them.</li> <li>Gray Jack </li> <li>Grim- Grims look like regular old zombies and move very slowly and only use melee attacks. To offput this, they travel in relatively large numbers.</li> <li>Hag </li> <li>Hardfang </li> <li>Howler </li> <li>Hybrid - Hybrids are the standard enemy type in Resistance 2. They are humanoid creatures that use the Bullseye weapon. </li> <li>Leaper- Leapers are small, spider-like creatures that are quick, though relatively easy to kill and travel in large numbers. </li> <li>Leech </li> <li><a href="http://resistance.wikia.com/wiki/Mauler" rel="nofollow">      Mauler <br /></a></li> <li>Menial </li> <li>Ravager - Ravagers are large hybrid-esque creatures. They carry a large shield as well as a powerful gun. One of the tougher enemies in the game. </li> <li>Roller </li> <li>Sirens </li> <li>Slipskull </li> <li>Spinner - Spinners are extremely small rodent-like creatures. They don't attack the player and are simply there for decoration. </li> <li>Steelhead </li> <li>Titan - Titans are close to the largest enemy in the game. They are enormous creatures with large, powerful guns that are almost instant death if the player is hit by one. They generally need to be taken down with high explosives. </li> <li>Widowmaker</li></ul> <br /><h2>Elite Chimera <br /></h2>Elite Chimera are chimeran breeds that require much more firepower to bring down than normal Chimera. Essentially making them boss characters. <br /><ul class="plain-list"><li>Daedalus - Daedalus is the final boss of the game. He is a large floating Chimera with unmatched intelligence and the ability to speak. He is said to be the father of the Chimera.</li> <li>Kraken - The Kraken is a large sea creature that is fought standing on a platform in the open sea. It is another enormous creature that attacks by sucking in air to pull the player into its mouth.</li> <li>The Swarm - The Swarm are a tightly woven pack of small flying bugs. They are extremely fast and can only be slowed down with gunfire. To kill them, you need a mixture of electromagnetic energy and a pulse cannon.</li> <li><a href="http://resistance.wikia.com/wiki/Mother_Spinner" rel="nofollow">      Mother Spinners</a> - Mother spinners are large versions of spinners that require significantly more shots to kill.</li> <li>Leviathan - The Leviathan was the main boss shown during the E3 2008 demo. It is an enormous, screen-filling monster that looks very similar to the titan and is a setpiece boss battle for the player. Eventually, he is killed by shooting a rocket at a bridge that falls on his head. </li> <li>Marauders - Marauders are giant frog-like creatures that spit fire as well as a fire-like substance. This substance is the same that comes out of spider grenades. </li> <li><a href="http://resistance.wikia.com/wiki/Angel" rel="nofollow">      Angels</a> </li> <li>Alpha Grims - Alpha Grims are slightly larger than grims and are almost exactly the same except they have significantly more health. </li> <li>Queen Leapers - Queen Leapers are massive Leapers that are also very fast and are protected by many smaller leapers as well. She is the boss during another set-piece moment in the game. </li> <li>Primarchs </li> <li>Overseers </li></ul> <br /><h2>Weapons</h2>Resistance 2 brings back many weapons such as the M5A2 Carbine, L23 Fareye, and Bullseye, which is significantly improved from the original game, but also adds all new weapons to the game.<br /><br /><h3>Returning Weapons</h3> <ul class="plain-list"><li><b>M5A2 Carbine</b>: This human assault rifle is one of your basic weapons in the game.  Its secondary fire is a grenade launcher.</li></ul><ul class="plain-list"><li><b>Rossmore 238</b>: A shotgun that is very powerful, but can only carry a small amount of ammo, its secondary fire is a double shot.</li> <li><b>L23 Fareye</b>: A bolt-action sniper rifle that is useful for picking off those far away enemies. It's secondary fire is a slow-mo mode that can only be used in the single player.</li> <li><b>Bullseye</b>: This Chimera assault rifle is the basic weapon for most Chimera, it fires very fast but is inaccurate.  Its secondary fire is a homing tag that, once on an enemy, will redirect all bullets to hit that enemy.</li> <li><b>Auger</b>: This Chimera weapon is a very unique weapon as it is able to shoot through walls at the enemy.  The secondary fire deploys a shield that protects the user, but is not able to be moved.</li> <li><b>LAARK</b>: A rocket launcher that causes massive damage to anything it hits.  Its secondary fire launches a storm of mini-rockets that cause a wide spread of damage.</li> <li><b>Hedgehog Grenade</b>: This grenade is a ball of spikes that after thrown shoots it's spikes in all directions, injuring anyone nearby.</li> <li><b>Frag Grenade</b>: A regular grenade, causes explosive damage.</li> <li><b>Air Fuel Grenade</b>: A grenade that lets off a cloud of gas and then ignites it causing combustion that causes damage to any enemy in/near the cloud.</li></ul><br /><h3>New Weapons</h3> <ul class="plain-list"><li><b>Magnum</b>: A pistol that shoots .44 rounds that can be detonated by using the secondary fire. Can also be fired into the environment for using as a trap.</li></ul><ul class="plain-list"><li><b>Marksman</b>: Chimera battle rifle that fires in 3 shot burst, very effective from mid-range. Its secondary fire shoots electronic orbs that shock all surrounding enemies.</li> <li><b>HVAP Wraith</b>: A mini-gun that shoots very quickly, but needs time to warm up before shooting.  Secondary fire deploys a shield that moves with the player</li> <li><b>Phoenix</b>: (Co-op only) The gun used by the medic that drains the energy from the enemy and then heals your teammates with bursts of health.</li> <li><b>V6 Splicer</b>: Weapon that shoots razor blades that ricochet off of walls and can hit the enemy more than once.  The secondary fire spins the razor blade red hot, and when it is shot, it sticks in the enemy and continues to cause damage, even severing limbs. Spinning the blade while touching an enemy will cause the V6 Splicer to function like a chainsaw. </li> <li><b>Bellock</b>: A semi-automatic grenade launcher that fires a grenade that bounces a few times before detonation. Its secondary fire fires off a grenade that causes anything it touches to be set on fire.</li> <li><b>Spider Grenade</b>: A grenade that explodes and unleashes a spread of flaming web-like lines incinerating anyone who touches them.</li> <li><b>Pulse Cannon</b>: A prototype weapon that, after charging, fires an extremely powerful, long range burst of energy. Its secondary fire launches a short range pulse blast that does not require charging and sprays in a wide cone. This is the strongest weapon in the game.</li></ul><br /><h2>Cooperative Multiplayer</h2>     The Cooperative multiplayer mode is a class-based shooter where players take on the roll of generic soldiers to fight the Chimera enemy.  Unlike Team Fortress 2, players battle against bots and not other players.  Players may only choose to fight on the side of the humans, they cannot fight as Chimera in co-op.  This mode contains 6 unique maps, each with objectives that are randomly stringed together depending on the number of players and their respective levels.  The number of enemies and their difficulty is also tuned to the number of players and their levels.  Players are also able to level up their classes from 1 - 30, buy upgraded equipment with acquired <b>Gray Tech</b>, unlock alternate guns as well as special skills called <b>Berserks</b>.  Each class has it's own strengths and weaknesses and requires each member to know the role of their class and be able to use it effectively in order to complete the mission; no one class is entirely sufficient (although the medic comes pretty close.)  Each level also contains collectible intel called <b>Status Reports.</b>  The cooperative mode has garnered much praise for the game.<br /><br /><h3>Soldier<br /></h3>     The soldier is essentially the "tank" of the game.  He can take quite a bit more damage than the other classes and has a powerful Primary Weapon.  Out of the three classes, the soldier is offensively the best.  He is armed with the Wraith (mini gun) with an alternate fire that deploys a force barrier (<a data-ref-id="3055-644" href="/energy-force-shield/3055-644/">       energy shield</a>.)  With this equipment, soldiers are able to decimate the enemy from behind their shield.  While very effective, the soldier burns though ammo pretty fast and the shield will deplete in the blink of eye when taking a lot of fire.  As a result, the soldier requires nearly constant ammo refills from the Special Ops to keep the shield up and remain offensively effective.<br /><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9247/822802-coop_iceland_stalker.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-822802" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9247/822802-coop_iceland_stalker.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-822802"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9247/822802-coop_iceland_stalker.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9247/822802-coop_iceland_stalker.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Soldier and Medic taking on a Stalker in co-op</figcaption></figure><br /><b>Primary Weapon</b><br /><ul class="plain-list"><li>Wraith (Default)</li></ul><br /><b>Secondary </b><b>Weapons</b><br /><ul class="plain-list"><li>Rossmore 238 (Level 2)</li></ul><ul class="plain-list"><li>Auger (Level 10)</li> <li>Bullseye (Level 18)</li> <li>Laark (Level 28)</li></ul><br /><b>Berserks</b><br /><ul class="plain-list"><li>Ironheart - Decreases damage done to player.

You can also create custom matches but unlike the cooperative custom matches, the players don't actually earn XP for playing in these games.<br /><ul class="plain-list"><li>Skirmish: Up to 60 players fight for points by completing objectives. Objectives can be as simple as capturing a beacon or some more complex objectives like assassinating a Priority target from the other team. Players are split into 5 man squads who have the same objectives and have to work as team to take down their rival squad.</li> <li>Core control: This mode is very much like Capture the Flag where 2 teams fight to get hold of the other teams core and bring it back to their base.The big difference is that, unlike most CTF modes, you actually carry the core in your hands making you unable to use your weapons and forcing you to rely on your teammates for cover.</li> <li>Team Deathmatch: This is the standard TDM that is in most online shooters. Two teams have to kill the set number of enemies from the opposing team before the other team does the same. This is also the second mode in the game that supports up to 60 players</li> <li>Deathmatch: This is the traditional every man for himself madness that you all know and love.

The RTS mechanics are intentionally simplified to encourage hands-on fighting, as opposed to sitting back and watching one's troops follow orders. Eddie can also utilize various magical Guitar Solos which have various effects. These Solos are learned by finding "Tab Slabs" in the open world. The solos include setting up rally flags for your troops and summoning your vehicle for all factions. Each faction also features signature Solos which only they have access to; for example, the Ironheade faction get the "Facemelter" Solo, which literally melts the faces off of nearby enemy infantry, and the "Bring it on Home" Solo which summons a flaming zeppelin to crash into the battleground, dealing massive damage to enemy units (a reference to one of Led Zeppelin's album covers, which depicted the crashing Hindenburg).</p><p style="">Multiplayer consists solely of stage battles, both 1-on-1 and 2-on-2 battles, with the players selecting from one of the three factions; the heavy metal Ironheade faction, the goth rock Drowning Doom faction, and the "industrial bondage" Tainted Coil faction. The glam rock Hair Metal Militia figure into the story, but are not playable.

The statement said all other projects were being reviewed. On July 29th, Tim Schafer updated the "Double Fine Action News" blog stating " <i>Brütal Legend</i> is fine." Schafer had mentioned previously that they would be showing more of the game off after <a href="/e3-2008/3015-3499/" data-ref-id="3015-3499">E3 2008</a>. <i>Variety</i> had reported that the game will not come from a traditional publisher and there is a "unique arrangement" for the game.</p><p style="">On December 12th, 2008 Double Fine and EA announced a publishing deal that would see the game released on October 13th, 2009.</p><p style="">On June 4th, 2009, Yahoo! reported that <a href="/activision/3010-78/" data-ref-id="3010-78">Activision</a> was filing a lawsuit against Double Fine, stating that they had invested $15 million dollars in the game and that they still had a valid contract to release it, despite Double Fine switching their publisher to <a href="/electronic-arts/3010-1/" data-ref-id="3010-1">Electronic Arts</a>. Tim Schafer responded in his usual facetious tone by saying that Activision should have "put a ring on it", referencing a song by Beyonce Knowles.</p><p style="">A countersuit was filed by Double Fine citing that the suit was malicious, done in an attempt to sink a competitor's product during a critical production phase.</p><p style="">Before the scheduled August 6th, 2009 ruling a settlement was reached between Activision and Electronic Arts and Double Fine. Activision received reportedly minimal compensation in the agreement according to the <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2009/08/actvision-double-fine-brutal-legend-settlement.html" rel="nofollow">L.A. Times</a>, though the exact amount was not disclosed. It is suggested in the linked article that Activision ended the suit in this matter to avoid losing the case.</p><h2>Promotion</h2><p style="">At the UK Download Festival 440 fans broke the Guinness World Record for “Most People Playing Air Guitar At One Time” to the tune of Motorhead’s “Ace of Spades" at the EA booth in order to promote <i>Brütal</i> <i>Legend</i>. The previous world record was 318 people set in 2008.</p><p style=""><i>Brütal</i> <i>Legend</i> was the main game showed off at Spike TV's Video Game Awards 2008, where a trailer was shown of the game.</p><p style="">Leading up to the release, the game was promoted by Jack Black on public TV shows such as the MTV VMA awards. Jack Black appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Kimmel, while Tim Schafer appeared on <a href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/99988/late-night-with-jimmy-fallon-tim-schafer-talks-brutal-legend#s-p1-st-i1" rel="nofollow">Late Night with Jimmy Fallon</a> before the game releases.</p><p style="">There were also a number of viral marketing videos featuring Jack Black in a muscle suit pretending to have gotten so into the role of Eddie Riggs that he gained an absurd amount of muscle mass and became tougher. In some cases Tim Schafer accompanied him to play along.</p><h2>Content Filter</h2><p style=""><i>Brütal Legend</i> has a content filter, similar to the one in <a href="/gears-of-war-2/3030-20662/" data-ref-id="3030-20662"><i>Gears of War 2</i></a>. Players have the <a href="/optional-censorship/3015-5122/" data-ref-id="3015-5122">option of censoring</a> offensive language and gore. The options will show up on screen in the first scene of the game, but can also be changed at any time via the in-game pause menu. Censoring language simply results in bleeping over obscenities, while the gore censor removes blood and slightly alters some cutscenes (for example: with the filter off characters may be decapitated, while the censor being on leaves them securely headed).</p><h2>Pre-Order Bonuses</h2><p style="">Retailers offered two different pre-order bonuses for <i>Brütal Legend</i>, Gamestop &amp; Gamestation <em>(a UK gaming store)</em> pre-orders rewarded customers a Tenacious D in-game guitar, replacing Eddie Riggs' guitar in multiplayer, and being selectable as a free guitar upgrade in single player, though only a superficial one. Best-Buy pre-orders came with special packaging of the game in a vinyl sleeve similar to the one seen in the main menu of the game.</p><p style="">In addition, a <i>Brütal</i> <i>Legend</i> t-shirt was given to the first 666 people who pre-ordered the game through GameStop back when the title was being published by Sierra.</p><h2>Licensed Soundtrack</h2><p style="">Tim Schafer announced <i>Brütal</i> <i>Legend</i>'s official soundtrack via <a href="/all-the-songs-in-brutal-legend/2300-1167/?page=3&amp;sort=first/" data-ref-id="2300-1167">a viral video</a>. In the video he solves a <a href="/rubiks-cube/3055-1992/" data-ref-id="3055-1992">Rubik's cube</a> while Emily Ridgeway, the game's Musical Director, reads the list of every band and song in the game, accidentally skipping two in the process. Schafer finished the Rubik's cube just in time.</p><p style="">The following is an incomplete listing of the soundtrack:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.3inchesofblood.com/" rel="nofollow">3 Inches of Blood</a> -

Both problems were solved after a 1.01 version update, but a 1.02 update sent before a piece of DLC somehow marked a return of both problems.</p><p style="">A solution available is to cancel the patch download after the first is at 100%, therefore meaning 1.01 is finished and 1.02 is made invalid. However, since some DLC for the game requires updating, the extra content may not work without the buggy 1.02 version installed, and online multiplayer is entirely impossible. The single-player game is fully functional with the 1.01 manipulation.</p><h2>PC System Requirements</h2><h3><strong>Minimum</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>OS:</strong>Windows XP

system</a> influenced by <a href="/gears-of-war/3025-565/" data-ref-id="3025-565">Gears of War</a> with flying segments reminiscent of <a href="/crimson-skies-high-road-to-revenge/3030-12911/" data-ref-id="3030-12911">Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge</a>, which several members of the Dark Void development team had worked on previously. Taking a queue from The Rocketeer movie, Dark Void also allows the player to fly with the aid of a <a href="/jet-pack/3055-6/" data-ref-id="3055-6">jet pack</a>.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1233964-t_darkvoid_thewatchers_hd_30.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1233964" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1233964-t_darkvoid_thewatchers_hd_30.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1233964"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1233964-t_darkvoid_thewatchers_hd_30.jpg"></a><figcaption>The Watchers</figcaption></figure><p style="">Set not long before the outbreak of the <a href="/world-war-ii/3015-471/" data-ref-id="3015-471">Second World War</a>, Dark Void follows the story of <a href="/will-grey/3005-356/" data-ref-id="3005-356">Will Grey</a>, owner of a cargo delivery operation. At the beginning of the game, Will is seen at an airfield in Nassau, waiting to begin his transatlantic flight over to Britain. He learns that an old flame of his, Ava, will be accompanying him on the flight. Will and Ava then take off in their plane, along with another friend Coop Williams, across the Atlantic ocean.</p><p style="">The flight goes according to plan until Will points out that they are flying over the <a href="/bermuda-triangle/3035-3050/" data-ref-id="3035-3050">Bermuda Triangle</a>. After joking about this to Ava and Coop, Will exclaims that he has seen a <a href="/ufo/3055-611/" data-ref-id="3055-611">UFO</a>. The bright light of the UFO then fills the cockpit and the plane begins to spin out of control. The cockpit's instruments start to go haywire and the plane then begins to lose altitude. The cabin then tears at the seams as Coop falls out of the plane to his death.

The leader tells Ava and Will that they are not welcome in their village and will be forced to leave. When leaving the town, a villager quietly calls them over to his hut, whose name is Tavi. Tavi then tells them to follow him to a nearby cave to meet someone. There, Will and Ava meet the infamous <a href="/nikola-tesla/3005-9322/" data-ref-id="3005-9322">Nikola Tesla</a>.

Will chases the Guard down and battles with it save Ava. When Ava is free, she decides to chase after The Watchers and follows them into the unknown, leaving Will behind.</p><p style="">Back in Nikola's cave, Will spends all night trying to fix up a plane.

Will asks Tavi about the devices and Tavi tells him that it is an experimental <a href="/jetpack/3030-4921/" data-ref-id="3030-4921">rocket pack</a>. Will then convinces Tavi to let him use it. Using the rocket pack, Will then travels outside around the area. Once outside, however, Will hears distress signals from some nearby soldiers asking for help against a Watcher patrol. Will then dispatches the patrol and makes his way into the Watcher base in the bottom of the canyon, by going to nearby towers and destroying the shield. When Will enters the base, he appears to be going through a strange tunnel.

Atem is part of the Survivors living in the Void.</p><p style="">Their duty is to fight against The Watchers. Atem explains to Will that The Watchers were an alien race one lived on the Earth, enslaving the human race. The humans eventually rebelled against them and locked the Watchers into the Void, with no way back to Earth. Atem reveals that The Watchers may have found a way back to Earth. Will then escorts Atem back to the base camp, fighting off the hordes of Watchers.</p><p style="">In the camp, Atem shows Will the Arc. The Arc is a large, flying metal building which houses the survivors. Atem then sends Will to the barracks and gives him an ancient Watcher helmet to help Will to fight against The Watchers. Will then sets off again to help more of the Survivors battle against The Watchers.</p><p style="">After the battle, Will, Atem and some Survivors return to The Arc to see that Ava and Nikola Tesla have returned. Will demands that he have a talk with Ava about what happened to her and to discuss some things that happened several years before. Before Ava can explain, a large amount of The Watchers launch an attack on The Arc. Ava tells Will that she have a personal talk with him after the oncoming battle. Will then uses his rocket pack and an energy cannon given to him by Tesla to stop The Watchers destoying The Arc. Will then gives The Arc enough time to fly away from the dangers of The Watcher attack. The Arc is then piloted over a long river to safety.</p><p style="">When save again, Atem begins to explain to Will about the meaning of why he is in the Void. Atem explains that Will is the</p><p style="">"Prophesied One" and must continue to help The Survivors battle against The Watcher aggression.

The Collector traps The Arc, forcing Will to use his rocket pack against the massive creature. He shoots a number of it's weak spots and then makes it lose grip of The Arc by shooting it's massive boils. This leaves The Arc save once again. Will and Ava return to The Arc to celebrate when a Watcher creature attacks Will and brings him to a Watcher prison.</p><p style="">Will is left trapped in a room until Atem and some Survivors burst into the room. They give Will a rifle to battle against a large number of Watcher forces that they must fight through to escape the prison. They fight until they get to the exit. Here, Atem returns Will's helmet and rocket pack back to him. Atem and Will then return to The Arc where Will meets up with Ava once again. Will is then told of his prophecy. He, along with Ava and the rest of the Survivors, must travel to a large tower that the Watchers use as their base. There, Will must destroy the link between the Earth and The Void so The Watchers must not travel through it.</p><p style="">When Will, Ava and the Survivor forces get to the tower, they are met by a huge dragon-like creature. Will then battles the creature by shooting it's weak chest and then pull each of it's three eyes out. Once Will removes two of it's eyes, the creature smashes into the tower, along with Will.

Before they can speak to one another, the head of The Watchers appears. It tells them to leave the portal alone and to leave this place.

Will reacts angrily to this, by firing a few rounds into the Watcher's chest, killing it.</p><p style="">Will holds Ava in his hands as she begins to say her final words. She tells him that the only way to close the portal back to the Earth is if they both hold each other's hand while Will stands in the portal. This will sacrifice Ava and will close the portal. Will rejects this at first but Ava convinces him otherwise. Will enters into the portal, holding his hands against Ava. Just before the portal closes, Will tells Ava that he loves her. The portal is then shut and Ava is left to die in the Void.</p><p style="">Back on Earth, Will goes to <a href="/london/3035-212/" data-ref-id="3035-212">London</a>. This is the city where Ava was born. He is seen sitting on a park bench. When Ava was alive, she told Will of this bench that was near Westminster that overlooked the <a href="/river-thames/3035-2575/" data-ref-id="3035-2575">River Thames</a>.

While the rocket pack can be used at any time, it is primarily used for either extended jumps or continual flight; while a hover option does become available, it only provides a very slow descent instead of the ability to actually hover in place. The rocket pack also enables the player to fly over enemy cover and shoot them for the sky.</p><p style="">This leads to the other mechanic used in Dark Void; <a href="/vertical-cover/3015-768/" data-ref-id="3015-768">vertical cover</a>. This involves the player moving their way either up or down ledges, that act as cover, through the environment. Most commonly this will be a canyon wall, although there are also some internal environments as well. While traversing these environments, the player will hang from a ledge, or crouch and peek over a ledge depending on the direction they are moving.</p><p style="">Dogfighting is another feature commonly seen in Dark Void's gameplay.

The guns mounted on the rocket pack allow the player to shoot down these ships. The player is also able to "skyjack" enemy or friendly ships. When the player flies close to a ship, the game will prompt the player with a button to take over the ship. If the ship is friendly, this process is automatic. If the ship is controlled by an enemy, the player will have to beat a <a href="/minigames/3015-116/" data-ref-id="3015-116">mini-game</a> to take control of the ship. The player can also do special moves with the rocket pack. If the player push a specific button and moves Will in a number of directions, he will do a flip or a <a href="/barrel-roll/3015-343/" data-ref-id="3015-343">barrel roll</a> to dodge oncoming enemy fire.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><p style="">Will has access to four different weapons which he can use and upgrade. Here is the list of those weapons;</p><h3>Guns</h3><h4>Liberator</h4><ul><li>Calibre: 7.92x33mm Kurz</li><li>Weight, Loaded: 5.6 kg</li><li>Length: 800mm</li><li>Rate of Fire: 15 rounds per sec</li><li>Operation: Can kill multiple enemies at close range using a high rate of fire and large clip.</li></ul><h4>Oppressor</h4><ul><li>Calibre: 8.2x50.8mm</li><li>Weight, Loaded: 4.1kg</li><li>Length: 800mm</li><li>Rate of Fire: 10 rounds per sec (semi-auto)</li><li>Operation: Highly accurate mid range weapon.</li></ul><h4>Reclaimer</h4><ul><li>Calibre: 7.62x54mmR</li><li>Weight, Loaded: 3.8 kg</li><li>Length: 1120mm</li><li>Rate of Fire: 1 round per sec (semi-auto)</li><li>Operation: Long range weapon with a scope for aiming.</li></ul><h4>Watcher Disintegration Gun</h4><ul><li>Calibre: 55.88mm</li><li>Weight, Loaded: 8.6 kg</li><li>Length: 960 mm</li><li>Rate of Fire: 1 rounds per sec (semi-auto)</li><li>Operation: Fires a projectile that disintegrates anything it makes contact with.</li></ul><h3>Grenades</h3><h4>Tesla Dynamite</h4><ul><li>Type: Gun Powder Based</li><li>Weight: 1.4 kg</li><li>Length: 32 cm</li><li>Explosive Radius: 5 meters</li><li>Operation: Once armed it has a delay of about 4 seconds before exploding.</li></ul><h4>Watcher Fusion Grenade</h4><ul><li>Type: Energy Based</li><li>Weight: 0.7 kg</li><li>Length: 16 cm</li><li>Explosive Radius: 8 meters</li><li>Operation: Once detonated, creates a slowly growing energy field that will disintegrate anyone inside it.</li></ul><h3>Upgrades</h3><p style="">Using a Weapons Locker or before the beginning of a mission, Will can upgrade his arsenal. The upgrading is done by using Tech Points. Tech points are earned by killing enemies and finding them in hidden areas of a level. Upgrades can be used to boost accuracy, increase damage, change clip size and other things. Each weapon has three levels and can be upgraded twice. The rocket pack can also be upgraded.</p><h2>Voice Cast</h2><p style=""><a href="/will-grey/3005-356/" data-ref-id="3005-356">Will Grey</a>, the protagonist of Dark Void, is voiced by prolific voice actor <a href="/nolan-north/3040-80008/" data-ref-id="3040-80008">Nolan North</a>.</p><p style=""><a href="/nikola-tesla/3005-9322/" data-ref-id="3005-9322">Nikola Tesla</a> is voiced by <a href="/paul-eiding/3040-3491/" data-ref-id="3040-3491">Paul Eiding</a>, also known for providing the voice for <a href="/colonel-roy-campbell/3005-839/" data-ref-id="3005-839">Colonel Roy Campbell</a> from the <a href="/metal-gear/3025-5/" data-ref-id="3025-5">Metal Gear</a> series.</p><h2>Reception</h2><p style="">Dark Void was met with a very mixed critical reception. A majority of reviewers gave the game a very middling score and call the game "average." IGN gave the game a 5 out of 10, Game Informer gave it a 7.0 (the highest score that Dark Void received) while GameTrailers gave it a 6.8.</p><p style="">Dark Void is also considered as a "flop". As of May 2010, the game sold only 520,000 copies. Capcom, the game's publisher, originally pegged the game with expected sales of around two million units. Dark Void only sold a quarter of Capcom's sales target.</p><h2>PC System Requirements</h2><h3>Minimum</h3><ul><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Pentium IV at 2.4 GHz or AMD 2.0 GHz</li><li><b>Video Card</b>: 256 MB VRAM – nVidia GeForce 7900 or ATI Radeon HD 3850 with support for DirectX 9.0</li><li><b>Memory</b>: 1 GB RAM</li><li><b>Hard Disk</b>: 10 GB of free Hard Drive Space</li><li><strong>Operating System:</strong> Microsoft Windows XP / Windows Vista</li><li><b>Sound Card</b>: -</li><li><b>Direct X:</b> 9.0</li><li><strong>Installation:</strong> DVD-ROM Drive</li></ul><h3>Recommended</h3><ul><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core 2 Duo at 2.4 GHz / AMD x64 at 2.0 GHz</li><li><b>Video Card</b>: 512 MB VRAM – nVidia GeForce 8800 / ATI Radeon HD 4830</li><li><b>Memory</b>: 2 GB RAM</li><li><b>Hard Disk</b>:10 GB of free Hard Drive Space</li><li><b>Operating System</b>: Microsoft Windows XP / Windows Vista</li><li><b>Sound Card</b>: -</li><li><b>Direct X</b>: 9.0</li><li><strong>Installation:</strong> DVD-ROM Drive</li></ul><h2>Games for Windows Live Support</h2><p style="">At least as of September 2010, PC Achievements through the <a href="/games-for-windows-live/3015-2452/" data-ref-id="3015-2452">Games For Windows Live</a> system are only available for the <a href="/games-on-demand/3015-3251/" data-ref-id="3015-3251">Games on Demand</a> version of Dark Void purchased through Games For Windows.

This marked McCreary's debut into the world of scoring video games as he was mostly scoring television at the time. From then McCreary has gone on to score the likes of <a href="/socom-4-us-navy-seals/3030-30196/" data-ref-id="3030-30196">SOCOM 4: U.S. Navy SEALs</a>, <a href="/moon-breakers/3030-38351/" data-ref-id="3030-38351">Moon Breakers</a> and upcoming MMO based on the SyFy original series, <a href="/defiance/3030-35523/" data-ref-id="3030-35523">Defiance</a>.</p><p style="">The score was praised among critics and added a lot to the game in terms of atmosphere and tone.

Like Devil May Cry, the game focuses on “Stylish Action” with over-the-top moves which the developer hopes will break new ground in the genre. Bayonetta was released on January 5, 2010 in the US and was Platinum Games's first release on the <a href="../../playstation-3/60-35/" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 3</a> and the <a href="../../xbox-360/60-20/" rel="nofollow">Xbox 360</a>.</p><p style="">Bayonetta is a third-person action adventure in the same vein as <a href="../../devil-may-cry/62-147/" rel="nofollow">Devil May Cry</a> with many apparent influences used within its gameplay design owing to the the fact that several of those that have worked on the title, including Hideki Kamiya, have also worked on the first <a href="../../devil-may-cry/61-13072/" rel="nofollow">DMC</a>. It spans sixteen chapters along with the epilogue. The game is named after its chief protagonist, Bayonetta, who is looking to discover her lost memories some twenty years after awakening from a deep sleep of over five centuries. This is exacerbated by the Lumen Angels that seem to be intent on killing her.</p><p style="">A currency system is also used in the game based on "halos" dropped by slain enemies or found in breakables. The title also uses a series of combination attacks which can be further enhanced by purchasing techniques that can expand the versatility of Bayonetta's skill set. Special attacks, such as Torture Attacks and Climax events, are also used as a part of Bayonetta's offensive arsenal.</p><p style="">Bayonetta also features a number of naming conventions based on a mix of Latin (notably for the Lumen Angels), Nordic (Ithavoll and Balder), and even Old English (Scarborough Fair). Unusual for a Japanese title, all of the lines in the game were recorded in English (aside from the language spoken by several of the main bosses) with the appropriately localized subtitles provided for each region.</p><h2>Wii U Version</h2><p style="">A <a href="/wii-u/3045-139/" data-ref-id="3045-139">Wii U</a> port of Bayonetta, developed by Osaka-based studio Bee Tribe and overseen by Kamiya himself, is being included for free with both the physical and eShop release version of its sequel, <a href="/bayonetta-2/3030-39764/" data-ref-id="3030-39764">Bayonetta 2</a> in North America and as part of a Special Edition in Europe and Japan. The physical version of the game is a separate disc packaged with the Bayonetta 2 disc. The European Special Edition of Bayonetta 2 that includes Bayonetta receives a higher age rating than the standalone Bayonetta 2 (rated PEGI 16/USK 16) release due to the first game being rated PEGI 18/USK 18.</p><p style="">This port will feature updated elements including bonus costumes for Bayonetta based on <a href="/link/3005-191/" data-ref-id="3005-191">Link</a>, <a href="/princess-peach/3005-709/" data-ref-id="3005-709">Princess Peach</a>, <a href="/princess-daisy/3005-807/" data-ref-id="3005-807">Princess Daisy </a>and <a href="/samus-aran/3005-99/" data-ref-id="3005-99">Samus Aran</a>.The costumes also come with character appropriate weapons such as the <a href="/master-sword/3055-16/" data-ref-id="3055-16">Master Sword</a> and change certain sound effects (such as the famous door unlock jingle) to those from <a href="/the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-to-the-past/3030-10276/" data-ref-id="3030-10276">The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</a> as per Hideki Kamiya's personal request.</p><p style="">Additionally, Bayonetta will include English and Japanese dual-audio tracks, run at 60 frames-per-second, support <a href="/off-tv-play/3015-7482/" data-ref-id="3015-7482">Off-TV Play</a> and feature the touch-controlled stylus mode from Bayonetta 2 for some casual novice play. The motivation behind the port is the fact that the original game had not been released on a Nintendo platform while the sequel is a Wii U exclusive published by Nintendo.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2488/584795-bayonetta_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-584795" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2488/584795-bayonetta_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-584795"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2488/584795-bayonetta_2.jpg"></a></figure><p style="">Five hundred years ago, two orders watched over the destiny of the world: the Lumen Sages and the Umbran Witches, light and dark. Together they ensured that the passage of history unfolded as it should, watching over it with two great treasures known only as the Eyes of the World. However, a grave transgression pit both sides against each other in a terrible war. Eventually, the Umbran Witches proved victorious over the Lumen Sages, but the hatred and superstition sown among the people of the world against their kind soon led to persecution and death for all but one of them.</p><p style="">Five hundred years later, Bayonetta is awakened from her sleep within a coffin that had been sealed and left at the bottom of a lake, far from the war and from the notice of anyone else. However, she awakens without the memories of her past. To make things worse, angels have noticed her awakening and have descended to destroy her. Unfortunately for them, she proves more than able to hold her own. With her favorite weapons in hand and with the help of several unlikely allies, she sets out to discover the truth of her origins and bring an end to the destruction.</p><h2>Characters</h2><p style="">Many different characters make up the game and not all of them will have Bayonetta's best interests at heart.</p><h3>Bayonetta</h3><p style="">Voiced By: <a href="/hellena-taylor/3040-80010/" data-ref-id="3040-80010">Hellena Taylor</a></p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/20618/1238292-bayo_bayonetta.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1238292" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.56729131175468" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/20618/1238292-bayo_bayonetta.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1238292"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/20618/1238292-bayo_bayonetta.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/20618/1238292-bayo_bayonetta.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Bayonetta</figcaption></figure><p style=""><i>"I'm sorry. I forgot to mention one of the reasons I hunt your kind. You're much too ugly not to put you out of your misery."</i></p><p style="">The protagonist is <a href="../94-5599/" rel="nofollow">Bayonetta</a>, a powerful witch who has been asleep for the past five hundred years. Twenty years before the game begins, however, she was awakened from her sleep from the bottom of a lake and has begun a quest to recover the lost memories of her past. She possesses long, black magical hair that also acts to covers her body in the form of her outfit making it appear to be leather. She also wields a variety of weapons as well as guns attached to the heels of her shoes. Her favorite handguns are a set called Scarborough Fair, an old English ballad focusing on four herbs - Parsley, Sage, Rosemary, and Thyme. Each gun bears the name of one of these herbs.</p><p style="">She has both ranged attacks thanks to her pistols as well as close combat skill with the use of her katana, although the number of weapons that she can use within the game offer many other opportunities for special attacks. For example, she has shown an ability to use the weapons that angels drop upon being defeated.</p><p style="">In Bayonetta's case, unlike the traditional perception and tradition of a Western witch, witches in the game are considered to have been tasked with protecting the world alongside their counterparts, the Lumen Sages. Neither side represented "good" or "evil" in the most obvious sense as both were required to hold the balance of the world in check. Witches also possess incredible powers granted to them by their deal with the Devil and when they die, are consigned to Hell whereas the Lumen Sages are claimed by the angels.</p><h3>Jeanne</h3><p style="">Voiced By: <a href="/grey-delisle/3040-10654/" data-ref-id="3040-10654">Grey DeLisle</a></p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/20618/1238296-bayo_jeanne.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1238296" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.56301369863014" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/20618/1238296-bayo_jeanne.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1238296"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/20618/1238296-bayo_jeanne.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/20618/1238296-bayo_jeanne.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Jeanne</figcaption></figure><p style=""><i>"What's the matter, sweetie?

Their relationship is shrouded in mystery, but as a witch, she is also as skilled with weapons and magic placing her at equal or better terms than Bayonetta. She appears in the second half of the PS3 demo as Bayonetta's opponent during the Cathedral duel. She also has a set of four handguns similar to Bayonetta's and is determined to confront her at nearly every turn. Her role in the game is intertwined with both the mysterious angels and Bayonetta's quest to discover the truth about her past. She is adept at using the same magic as Bayonetta.</p><h3>Rodin</h3><p style="">Voiced By: <a href="/khary-payton/3040-85169/" data-ref-id="3040-85169">Khary Payton</a></p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/20618/1238291-bayo_rodin_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1238291" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.56899488926746" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/20618/1238291-bayo_rodin_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1238291"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/20618/1238291-bayo_rodin_1.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/20618/1238291-bayo_rodin_1.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Rodin</figcaption></figure><p style=""><i>"Your fights are yours alone.

He has been described by character designer, Mari Shimazaki, as "a demon gunsmith who plays a big-brother role to Bayonetta". He has also been described by Bayonetta concept designer, Ikumi Nakamura as being "-bald as the night is long" with "a real presence about him". The menu for his bar was offered with a selection of soundtracks slipped into its cover as a pre-order incentive in Japan.</p><p style=""><a href="../../rodin/94-13736/" rel="nofollow">Rodin</a> also creates upgraded weapons or items for Bayonetta depending on whether she can bring back Angel LPs, golden records that allow Rodin to call forth angels. In doing so, he uses their souls to forge the weapons and items that he provides to Bayonetta, often emerging bloody and out-of-breath from mid-air after leaving with an LP to go work on them.</p><h3>Enzo</h3><p style="">Voiced By: Allan Groves</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/20618/1238295-bayo_enzo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1238295" data-size="small" data-ratio="1" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/20618/1238295-bayo_enzo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1238295"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/20618/1238295-bayo_enzo.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/20618/1238295-bayo_enzo.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Enzo</figcaption></figure><p style=""><i>"At least get me a drink at Rodin's before you start drilling me."</i></p><p style="">He's the underground informant tapping into a vast network of sources to get what he needs.

At first, he is skeptical of the whole operation until the attack actually happens. Even after nearly crushing his car as an accident, <a href="../../enzo/94-13737/" rel="nofollow">Enzo</a> agrees to help her with a tip on a European "whale" that is trying to sell a large gem that may be the matching pair to the one that Bayonetta bears on her amulet.</p><h3>Luka</h3><p style="">Voiced By: <a href="/yuri-lowenthal/3040-81915/" data-ref-id="3040-81915">Yuri Lowenthal</a></p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/20618/1238297-bayo_luka.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1238297" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.56301369863014" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/20618/1238297-bayo_luka.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1238297"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/20618/1238297-bayo_luka.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/20618/1238297-bayo_luka.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Luka</figcaption></figure><p style=""><i>"I'm not your pet.

He turns up in the most surprising places and is in pursuit of Bayonetta for deeply personal reasons that have to do with the death of his father. He also fancies himself something of a ladies man and never hesitates in pouring on the charm whenever the opportunity presents itself.

Whether or not the two are actually bound by blood is still something of a puzzle that must be unraveled.</p><h3>Balder</h3><p style="">Voiced By: <a href="/liam-obrien/3040-97533/" data-ref-id="3040-97533">Liam O'Brien</a></p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5370/1258684-father_balder.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1258684" data-size="medium" data-ratio="1.2377622377622" data-width="286" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 286px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:123.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5370/1258684-father_balder.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1258684"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5370/1258684-father_balder.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5370/1258684-father_balder.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Balder</figcaption></figure><p style=""><i>"The time has come to awaken 'The Eyes of the World'."</i></p><p style="">A mysterious, white robed figure who is the CEO of the mighty Ithavoll Corporation that runs the city of <a href="../../vigrid/95-2694/" rel="nofollow">Vigrid</a> and has extended its control over the entire country, restricting travel across its borders, and making it the most powerful force in the world today.

This hair morphing ability is also used to perform double jumps and morphs around her to form her outfit. Finishing moves, also known as Torture Attacks, are performed against minor enemies as she summons various torture devices including an “iron maiden” and guillotine to completely destroy them. Performing moves such as these will remove hair off her body, the more powerful attacks (such as Climax events) rendering her nearly naked.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1239152-t_bayonetta_vp_gt_hd_159.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1239152" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1239152-t_bayonetta_vp_gt_hd_159.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1239152"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1239152-t_bayonetta_vp_gt_hd_159.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1239152-t_bayonetta_vp_gt_hd_159.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>One of Bayonetta's finishing moves, the guillotine</figcaption></figure><p style="">Like <a href="../../viewtiful-joe/61-15876/" rel="nofollow">Viewtiful Joe</a>, slow-motion (dubbed Witch Time) is used in both cinematic events and combat. Using these attacks she will fight “Angels” that appear to be inspired by European mythology with cherub style faces and ornate armor and wings. The player can also temporarily wield weapons dropped by enemies, such as a tuba that is used as a <a href="../../bazooka/93-2394/" rel="nofollow">bazooka</a>. Bayonetta has a special bar under her health bar, this bar allows you to preform special magical attacks, like summoning torture devices, you can fill it by doing combos with out being hit, in a similar way to the "Stylish" bar in the <a href="../../devil-may-cry/62-147/" rel="nofollow">DMC</a> series.</p><p style="">Despite earlier reports to the contrary, Bosses have a health bar in the final version in addition to showing visible damage. For example, the mini-boss in the E3 presentation had layers of armor on him, Bayonetta destroyed his armor and then summoned a giant dragon and finished him off. The boss dropped a gold record, another 60's music reference. These records unlock new weapons when taken to Rodin. Defeated enemies drop angel halos that is used as currency to power-up your weapons, unlock skills, and buy items in said place. Gameplay is not only crazy and over the top but it's like Devil May Cry on speed. The action is blazingly fast as you pull off combo after combo in lightning speed. Many of these combos are so fast that you barely notice that Bayonetta is de-robed when doing her powerful finishing moves.</p><h3>Cosmology: Trinity of Realities</h3><p style="">The world of Bayonetta is divided into what is known as the Trinity of Realities: Purgatorio, Inferno, and Paradiso. It is hinted that it wasn't always this way until the First Armageddon in which Jubileus, as the manifestation of the Divine Will, was forced to govern Paradiso.</p><p style="">Umbran Witches had the ablity to traverse between Purgatorio (which stands between Paradiso and Inferno) and the 'real' world. While in Purgatorio, they can affect objects in the real world, although no one can see them aside from the destruction that they cause which can cause them to flee. From their perspective, a park bench had just exploded for no apparent reason. Humans and other living things are represented as distortions to those in Purgatorio and are completely unaffected by any attack unless the Witch decides to drop into their reality.</p><h3>Difficulty</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1239174-t_bayonetta_vp_gt_hd_212.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1239174" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1239174-t_bayonetta_vp_gt_hd_212.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1239174"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1239174-t_bayonetta_vp_gt_hd_212.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1239174-t_bayonetta_vp_gt_hd_212.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Bayonetta includes 5 difficulty settings:</p><ul><li>Very Easy</li><li>Easy</li><li>Normal</li><li>Hard</li><li>Non-Stop ∞ Climax</li></ul><p style="">Very Easy, Easy, and Normal are the only difficulty choices available initially.

Platinum games has stated that each weapon will contain a "monster" spirit and that they are designing weapons that "you could hardly imagine". Bayonetta will be able to equip Weapons on her hands, legs, or both, and you can charge the katana for more powerful attacks.</p><p style="">This will cause a heart to appear on screen that beats when you charge it up and dark fumes billow from the sword. Bayonetta also has a huge chain and sickle that she uses for both ground and air attacks. You can equip all 4 guns at once or you can opt to swap out the pistols in her hands for a sword and use the guns on her feet as well. Certain weapons are designed to be equipped for the hands, feet, or both. You can even upgrade or buy new weapons or use the ones that enemies drop.</p><h3>Concoctions</h3><p style="">Bayonetta also has the ability to mix together concoctions that can create special lollipop candies that she can use as healing aids or enhancements to her abilities. The ingredients can be found by breaking items throughout the game and a maximum limit of 99 items of each type can be stocked. The ingredients required for mixing together different concoctions are:</p><ul><li>Baked Gecko</li><li>Mandragora Root</li><li>Unicorn Horn</li></ul><h3>Angel Attack</h3><p style="">Special bullets can also be collected in each stage allowing Bayonetta to play an arcade shooter called "Angel Attack" at the end of the stage. The points earned during the game can be swapped out for different lollipops or other items.

A number of angels appear in front of her meaning a battle is about to ensue. Angels are Bayonetta's main adversaries through out the game. There is a formidable angelic foe at the end of the Big Little City zone.<br />It's not a boss but it's wields a giant <a href="../../axe/93-437/" rel="nofollow">two-handed axe</a>. Bayonetta can jump over the attacks even without "Witch Time". Humorously, this giant miniboss has pathetically tiny wings, gold piercings, and the famous angel halo.

PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2, Wii, Nintendo DS, and PSP. It features a variety of new additions to the series, including a holographic environment for players to train in, a player skill analysis system, an on-demand picture-in-picture play-call window, a new system of dynamic cameras, the ability to play custom music, and much more.</p><h3>Cover Athlete</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4876/549353-madden09.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-549353" data-size="small" style="width: 403px" data-ratio="0.59553349875931" data-width="403" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:59.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4876/549353-madden09.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-549353"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/4876/549353-madden09.jpg"></a><figcaption>The legend in his new jersey</figcaption></figure><p style="">Brett Favre was chosen as the cover athlete for the game by EA, when he had announced his retirement from football. The decision was announced on the Late Show with Dave Letterman, and sparked rumors that EA was trying to kill off the "Madden Curse" by having a non-active player on the cover. Officially, EA simply said they wanted to honor Favre's career. However, in August, Favre announced he would be returning to football as a Jet. Obviously, due to production, the cover picture still has Favre in a Packers Jersey, even though he is technically a Jet this season. <a href="http://www.ea.com/" rel="nofollow">EA.com</a> will have a downloadable cover featuring Favre in a Jets uniform, but no retail runs of the game will be made with Favre in a Jets uniform. Despite not being expected to play this season, Favre is included as a playable character in the game, via roster update. The madden curse was also effective this year on Brett Favre possibly makeing this his last year to play football.</p><h2>Feature Breakdown</h2><h3>Xbox 360 &amp; PS3</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3508/245994-beyondbroadcast.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-245994" data-size="small" style="width: 960px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="960" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3508/245994-beyondbroadcast.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-245994"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/3508/245994-beyondbroadcast.jpg"></a><figcaption>Picture-in-Picture window</figcaption></figure><ul><li>In this years Madden EA has added a new "Adaptive Difficulty Engine" which will change the AI's strengths depending on the player's skills.

Gamers will be able to take the full Madden I.Q. test in the Virtual Trainer which consists of passing, rushing, pass defense, and rush defense drills.</p><p style="">Once done with the I.Q. test gamers will be able to play one of the new Madden Moments. The moment will be leading the New York Giants down the field with 2 minutes to go in Super Bowl XLII against the New England Patriots. There is no limit on how many times/how long the demo can be played.</p><h2>Patch 2.0</h2><p style="">EA have released a second patch to Madden NFL 09 which fixed some major issues with the game.</p><ul><li><h3>Kicking play disconnect</h3>If two opponents play a game with two different camera angles, in any situation where a game winning or tying kick was to be made, a disconnect could occur. "ActionCam" forces the game to go into slow-motion to add drama to these late kicks, but unfortunately the Classic camera does not, thus forcing the "disconnect". This has been fixed...all cameras can still be used as well.</li><li><h3>Stability issues in the play call / halftime highlights / post-game highlights</h3></li></ul><p style="">During the play calling screen or highlights screen the game would freeze and as a result all progress would be lost forcing the player to play the game over again.</p><ul><li><h3>"WR direct snap" exploit</h3>Some players found an exploit to direct snap to a WR for easy short yardage gain. Not only are EA fixing this play (i.e. they aren't removing it), they are also going to be re-setting records for anyone with a winning record that has been found to be using this play.</li><li><h3>Franchise Progression / Regression</h3>The lack of higher numbers was a tuning value that I think everyone agreed was just too low. This has been juiced up so you should see more realistic progression now.</li><li><h3>Edited players don't progress</h3>Players were not progressing after their jersey number (or pretty much any other attribute). This has been fixed.</li><li><h3>Stability issue when exiting Madden '93 in CE version</h3>This has been fixed.</li><li><h3>Deep ball glitch</h3>Some players found a way to throw a deep ball while crossing the LOS and hit a receiver wide open at a decent rate. EA addressed this by making sure the DB will no longer break on the ball when the QB crosses the line while throwing.</li><li><h3>CPU running out of bounds</h3>This bug appears when the CPU tries to switch hands while running to the sidelines. This is fixed for patch 2.</li><li><h3>Penalty sliders ineffective</h3>A common complaint from the hardcore community was the lack of effect from the penalty sliders.</li><li><h3>Field degradation</h3>Another common complaint was the lack of field degradation. The effect was very subtle, which was also<br />getting overshadowed by the lighting and post effects, so the effect will be increased.</li><li><h3>Stability issue with the Eagles and a full ring meter</h3>Fixed a rare issue where the gamer could run into stability issues while using the Eagles in mini-game with a ring meter that was completely full.</li><li><h3>Play call screen hitch</h3>Fixed a bug that was causing a noticeable hitch when exiting the play call screen</li><li><h3>Prevent Defense issue</h3>Fixed an issue where defenders sharing a deep zone/prevent assignment would loosen their coverage (because they thought the other guy was covering for them), which allowed the receiver to get behind them even though they were in Prevent.</li><li><h3>Brett Favre stats</h3>With the late addition of Brett Favre, career stats were not implemented into the game for Farve. These stats will be added for patch 2.</li><li><h3>Defensive Preplay Mis-cue</h3>Fixed an issue where defenders would leave their man wide open in a Cover 3.</li><li><h3>CPU quick-snap</h3>A very common complaint was the speed at which the CPU snapped the ball. A random length of time (no less than 5 seconds) is added for the CPU to wait and even make pre-play adjustments.</li><li><h3>Online playbook switch</h3>Fixed an issue where playbooks were re-setting to the defaults after the playbook select popup was closed.</li></ul><h2>Madden En Español</h2><p style="">Madden 09 released an 'En Español' version which featured Bear's lineman Roberto Garza on the cover.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>20711</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/2250693-box_madden09.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/2250693-box_madden09.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/2250693-box_madden09.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/2250693-box_madden09.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/2250693-box_madden09.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2250693-box_madden09.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/2250693-box_madden09.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Madden NFL 09]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>7</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-6/]]></api_detail_url><id>6</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: E]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-7/]]></api_detail_url><id>7</id><name><![CDATA[PEGI: 3+]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-25/]]></api_detail_url><id>25</id><name><![CDATA[CERO: A]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-14/]]></api_detail_url><id>14</id><name><![CDATA[OFLC: G]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2008-08-12 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-18/]]></api_detail_url><id>18</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation Portable]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-portable/3045-18/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PSP]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-19/]]></api_detail_url><id>19</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 2]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-2/3045-19/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS2]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-32/]]></api_detail_url><id>32</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox/3045-32/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[XBOX]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-52/]]></api_detail_url><id>52</id><name><![CDATA[Nintendo DS]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-ds/3045-52/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[DS]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/madden-nfl-09/3030-20711/]]></site_detail_url></game></results><version>1.0</version></response>
