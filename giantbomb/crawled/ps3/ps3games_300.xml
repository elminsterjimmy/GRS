Afrika is a photography simulation game set in an unknown country of Africa. It is often considered a spiritual successor to <a data-ref-id="3030-10024" href="/pokemon-snap/3030-10024/" slug="pokemon-snap">                                                       Pokémon Snap</a>, but with more safari and less track.  <br/> <br/>First revealed at Sony's E3 2006 press conference (essentially as a tech demo), the game prominently focused on utilizing the <a data-ref-id="3045-35" href="/playstation-3/3045-35/" slug="playstation-3">                                                       PS3</a> hardware to its full potential to create an extensively life-like experience. The long-awaited game was first released in Japan and Asia in August 2008, followed by North America in October 2009. The game's reception has been, internationally, largely positive.<br/> <h2>Gameplay</h2> <figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/43718/1349376-annaanderic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1349376" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.1157407407407" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:111.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/43718/1349376-annaanderic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1349376"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/43718/1349376-annaanderic.jpg"></a><figcaption> Stylin' Profilin'</figcaption></figure>     In Afrika, you play as either Eric, a journalist from France or Anna, a Zoologist from the USA. You have both been hired to explore the <b>Manyanga Conservation Area</b> which is an unspecified region of <a data-ref-id="3035-284" href="/africa/3035-284/" slug="africa">                                                       Africa</a>. While surveying the land, throughout the game you are given tasks via email at your base camp. As the game progresses, the requests become more detailed, forcing you to capture the animals in a specific action: an elephant spraying water, a cheetah taking down a gazelle, etc...<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, the control of your character is generally limited to binoculars and the camera, while your NPC guide James controls the jeep between locations. However, you're able to stop and/or exit the jeep to get close ups of the animals. Soon you get to have full control of the jeep, and the other character tags along in the back, surveying the land as you continue your quests for those perfect shots. <figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/43718/1352801-afrika_9.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1352801" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.66666666666667" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:66.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/43718/1352801-afrika_9.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1352801"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/43718/1352801-afrika_9.jpg"></a><figcaption> There's always a wonderful moment to capture on film.</figcaption></figure> Occasionally the other character will drive, so you can capture a moment while on the move.   <br/> <br/>It's not limited to just daytime, as you will later gain the ability to go on a Safari at night. When evening comes and you are back at the Base Camp, exiting will prompt which location you would like to visit. You then quick-jump there, and control of the Jeep goes back to on-rails and AI controlled; you are only allowed to walk a certain distance away from the Jeep, before you are called back. After all, it's dangerous at night and you really shouldn't wander off too far anyway.<br/><br/>Taking pictures makes use of the PS3 Sixaxis control scheme. Allowing you to zoom, focus, and tilt the camera in order to achieve just the right shot. These elements play a significant factor when choosing to sell the photos, as the game rates them based on these specifications, and pays accordingly. Cash earned from selling photos can be used to purchase new supplies or upgrades for your camera, which in turn gives you the chance to take better and better photos. <br/> <br/><h3>CONTROLS</h3><table class="t-editor with-border full-width"><tbody><tr><th>Jeep Controls<br/></th><th>On Foot Controls<br/></th></tr><tr><td><b>Right Stick</b> - Move around <br/><b>Left Stick</b> - Steer Vehicle <br/><b>L2</b> - Stop Vehicle <br/><b>R2</b> - Accelerate Vehicle <br/><b>R1</b> - Binoculars <br/><b>Circle</b> - Talk (Use to get a tip on what to do next.) <br/><b>Triangle</b> - Field Menu Options <br/><b>Square</b> - Use Camera <br/><b>X</b> - Exit Vehicle <br/><b>Start</b> - Change view <br/><b>Select</b> - GPS<br/></td><td><b>Right Stick</b> - Look around <br/><b>Left Stick</b> - Move <br/><b>L3</b> - Make a Whistling noise <br/><b>R1</b> - Binoculars <br/><b>Triangle</b> - Field Menu Options <br/><b>Square</b> - Use Camera  <br/><b>Directional Buttons</b> - Crouch / Peer Left, Right / Stand <br/><b>Start</b> - Toggle 1st Person / 3rd Person view <br/><b>Select</b> - GPS</td></tr></tbody></table>When in <b>Camera Mode</b>, aim with the left stick and Zoom with the right.

It has pictures, a detailed 3D model of the animal (from adult to infant), background information, and animal to human size comparison among other things. <br/>You can also <b>Save</b> your game from here, which is highly advisable as the Autosave is sporadic. You are only allowed one slot (that the autosave also uses), and Afrika save files are 387MB in size so the process takes some time.<br/></li><li><b>Exit</b> - Go out and Safari!</li></ul><b>Field Camp</b><br/>If you are far off from Base Camp and you bought a tent, you get the ability to camp in the current area for the night. Options are limited to  <b>Tent</b>, <b>Friend</b> and <b>Photos</b>, but the convenience of camping eliminates back and forth traveling, and the chance to take photos early in the morning. Which is a plus for some missions that require a morning shot, or some animals will only be available at this time. <br/><h2>Cameras and Items<br/></h2><h3>Types of Cameras</h3><h3>Body</h3><ul class="plain-list"><li> <b>TSETSE TYPE F</b> - A camera with basic features intended for amateurs.

It was later included with its sequel in <a href="/tales-of-symphonia-chronicles/3030-42795/" data-ref-id="3030-42795">Tales of Symphonia Chronicles</a> for the PlayStation 3. The game is characterized by its lengthy storyline, cel-shaded animated graphics (complete with voice overs in <a href="/cutscene/3015-22/" data-ref-id="3015-22">cutscenes</a>), and its <a href="/linear-motion-battle-system/3015-219/" data-ref-id="3015-219">Linear Motion Battle System</a>. More emphasis is placed on the protagonist's relationships with his party members by the decisions he makes than previous installments in the series. Symphonia is also a distant prequel to the Tales series first entry, <a href="/tales-of-phantasia/3030-255/" data-ref-id="3030-255">Tales of Phantasia</a>.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Battle System</h3><p style="">Fighting in Tales of Symphonia is not like a <a href="/active-time-battle/3015-95/" data-ref-id="3015-95">traditional RPG</a>. Just like other Tales games, it uses a modified version of the <a href="/linear-motion-battle-system/3015-219/" data-ref-id="3015-219">Linear Motion Battle System</a>, which features real-time fights. The player can only directly control one character, while the rest of the party is controlled by A.I. However, if there are more controllers installed in the game, other people can control the other three characters whilst in battle.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2352/220539-tos126.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-220539" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.70094936708861" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:70.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2352/220539-tos126.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-220539"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2352/220539-tos126.jpg"></a><figcaption>Characters no longer have to share the same horizontal pathway</figcaption></figure><p style="">The newest addition to the battle system is a 3D plane. Players and enemies no longer are crowded up on a horizontal line. The player can still only move exclu s ively left and right, but can switch directions by pushing the right trigger button and switching the target. Also new to Symphonia is Overlimit. As the players , or occasionaly the enemy, reach a certain amount of tension points, they will go into Overlimit mode. Overlimit mode briefly reduces the character's reci eved damage, stops staggering, and decreases spell casting time. Sheena can only make Summons while in Overlimit mode. Unison Attacks are a lso a feature unique to Symphonia.

It will also have a sentence about the skit next to it. In these skits, it shows the characters talking about something that just happened or something totally random. There are also some skits on the overworld that will trigger when you go to a certain area or into a glowing circle of light. These affect Lloyd's relationship with the people in his party. Some things you do in the skits where you answer questions can change a major event in the game; others might change something small, but they can all add up. There is only one major game changing event based on the relationship of characters, otherwise, it just helps you get more scenes.</p><h3>Summons</h3><p style="">Sheena Fujibayashi has the ability to summon spirits to help her in battle.

He joins the party shortly after a pivotal moment in the story.</p><h3>Plot</h3><p style="">Tales of Symphonia was the first game in the series to have "secret" characters and potentially unplayable player characters. In the beginning of the game Lloyd works with Kratos through the introductory dungeon then acts as a rival for the rest of the game. However, during the very last dungeon of the game the player can make a choice which fills in the story as Kratos secretly being on their side the whole time while Zelos was betraying them. Whoever you choose as the traitor is the person you must defeat in battle next. Whoever is left will join your party. It is important to note that with the release of the sequel it is clear that picking Zelos for the team is the canon choice.</p><p style="">The game is based in the world called Sylvarant which lives off of mana. At this time the world is in a form of depression and losing mana, so the Chosen one must travel the world going to ancient shrines where there they must summon spirits to break something called seals allowing the mana to flow back into Sylvarant. There are five seals in the world altogether. You start off playing Lloyd Irving, a boy who decides to protect and help his friend Colette Brunel the chosen one.</p><p style="">Two of Lloyd's fellow townsfolk join him on his quest; his best friend Genis Sage, and Genis' older sister and their teacher Raine Sage. Shortly after they set off for their quest they meet a mysterious man named Kratos Aurion who volunteers to help and protect Colette on her journey of regeneration. Later on a female assassin who attempts to stop you, but fails several times, joins your party named Sheena Fujibayashi. Sheena is sent from another world called Tethe'alla to assassinate Colette.</p><p style="">As Colette gets closer to reaching her goal of world regeneration they stumble upon several twists to complicate their situation. They learn that the angels are manipulating them for their personal reasons and that Kratos is an angel.</p><p style="">They then learn of the other world called Tethe'alla that shares mana with Sylvarant and that one prospers with mana while the other falls into a a state of disrepair. The remaing members (excluding Kratos) journey to the other world to find answers to their dilemma. While there they decide to restore mana to both worlds for both of them to prosper.</p><p style="">While in Tethe’alla they meet new people who join their cause. One is a small girl named Presea Combatir who seems rather strong for a girl and shows little emotion. They then meet up with Zelos Wilder, the man who is the chosen for Tethe’alla. Zelos is somewhat arrogant, a ladies man, and rather carefree.</p><p style="">The last member to join their party is Regal Bryant, a man who is a convict. Regal fights with his feet instead of his hands since they remain bound for what he believes is an unforgivable crime. They then set out to open the seals in Tethe’alla so as to sever the bonds of both worlds. Through this quest they end up reviving an ancient tree of mana and with something called the Eternal Sword they are able to connect the worlds and restore mana to both.</p><h3>Links to Tales of Phantasia</h3><ul><li>The Yggdrasil Tree in Phantasia is named after the main villain in Symphonia.</li><li>Many locations are the same</li><li>The two world maps are very similar</li><li>Sheena and Suzu both have the same last name</li></ul><h2>Tales of Symphonia 2</h2><p style="">Tales of Symphonia received a sequel on the Wii called Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World. The game followed the main character Emil and his friend Marta on their quest to save the world while searching for the main characters from the first game. The fallout that from the merging of the worlds at the end of the first game led to a lot of problems in Sylvarant and Tethe'alla. At the start of the game Lloyd is going around from town to town and working with the Vanguard to destroy local villages while searching for something. Before the game starts Emil's parents were killed in an attack by Lloyd at Emil's hometown. The sequence of events which revived the world tree at the end of the first game led to the death of Marta's mother as well, and she blames Collette for that as the Chosen of Regeneration.</p><p style="">The Tales of Symphonia characters appear throughout the plot in the sequel and are playable at different times. A large part of the game is the original gangs quest to fully regroup with one another so it is only late in the game that the player finally gets all of the players. However, there is not much of an incentive to use the characters in the player party because they stay at level 50 the entire game and do not earn any experience. It is best for the player to keep their monsters in the active party slots.</p><p style="">Tales of Symphonia 2 was the first game in the series to feature fully voice acted skits. Although very few of the original voice actors have been retained through to the sequel.</p><h2>Music</h2><p style="">The soundtrack containing all the tracks found in the original GameCube release was released in October 1st, 2003, it contained 4 CDs; while a little more than a year later, on 27 October in 2004 a revised version was released due to the Playstation 2 release of the game, containing the remaining Playstation 2 exclusive tracks.</p><p style="">The opening theme was performed by Day After Tomorrow.</p><p style="">The complete set of tracks is the following:</p><h3>Disc One</h3><p style="">01 - Tales of Symphonia</p><p style="">02 - A Prologue</p><p style="">03 - Old Familiar Scent of Iselia</p><p style="">04 - Lloyd</p><p style="">05 - Colette</p><p style="">06 - Genis</p><p style="">07 - Raine</p><p style="">08 - Kratos</p><p style="">09 - Unsatisfied Desire</p><p style="">10 - Standing the Pain</p><p style="">11 - Overcome</p><p style="">12 - Dad, I'm Home</p><p style="">13 - Talk About Sylvarant</p><p style="">14 - The Land of Sylvarant</p><p style="">15 - Full Force</p><p style="">16 - Victory</p><p style="">17 - Rest of the Heart</p><p style="">18 - Desert Flower</p><p style="">19 - The Struggle to Survive</p><p style="">20 - Rovers</p><p style="">21 - Along the Beach</p><p style="">22 - Harbor Town</p><p style="">23 - Town of Wind and Ruins</p><p style="">24 - Untold Despair</p><p style="">25 - Water Symphony</p><p style="">26 - Water Symphony ~Despair~</p><p style="">27 - Sweet Dreams</p><h3>Disc Two</h3><p style="">01 - Nova's Caravan</p><p style="">02 - Venturers' Colony</p><p style="">03 - Search for the Seal ~Sylvarant~</p><p style="">04 - Escape From Enemy Base</p><p style="">05 - Lloyd ~ Ocarina Version~</p><p style="">06 - Collet ~Sad~</p><p style="">07 - Raine -Ruin Mode-</p><p style="">08 - The Tower</p><p style="">09 - Confusion</p><p style="">10 - An Appearance</p><p style="">11 - Delightful Day</p><p style="">12 - Behind Us</p><p style="">13 - In the Ashes</p><p style="">14 - Deep Fear</p><p style="">15 - On the Very Edge!</p><p style="">16 - Off-Key</p><p style="">17 - Moonlight</p><p style="">18 - Wood Carving Star</p><p style="">19 - Shining Dew</p><p style="">20 - The Grudge</p><p style="">21 - Fatalize</p><p style="">22 - On the Tight Rope</p><p style="">23 - New One World</p><p style="">24 - On the Hill at Night</p><p style="">25 - Floating in the Air</p><p style="">26 - Nobody Knows</p><h3>Disc Three</h3><p style="">01 - Far From Our World</p><p style="">02 - The Kingdom City of Meltokio</p><p style="">03 - Darkside of Meltokio</p><p style="">04 - A Selfish Want</p><p style="">05 - Tethe'Alla Castle</p><p style="">06 - Presea</p><p style="">07 - Zelos</p><p style="">08 - Walking on Tethe'Alla</p><p style="">09 - Like a Glint of Light</p><p style="">10 - Academic City</p><p style="">11 - Secret From the Blue Sky</p><p style="">12 - Regal</p><p style="">13 - Trip on the Ship</p><p style="">14 - Sheena</p><p style="">15 - Shinobi Life</p><p style="">16 - Anchor</p><p style="">17 - Underground Passage</p><p style="">18 - Dry Trail</p><p style="">19 - In a Shadowy Woods</p><p style="">20 - Deepest Woods</p><p style="">21 - Dance in the Sunshine</p><p style="">22 - A Snow Light</p><p style="">23 - Aviators ~Rheards~</p><p style="">24 - Rest of the Heart ~Sanctuary~</p><p style="">25 - Serenade of Elves</p><p style="">26 - Torent Forest</p><p style="">27 - Firing</p><p style="">28 - A Break Down</p><p style="">29 - Zelos ~Serious~</p><p style="">30 - Mithos</p><p style="">31 - Encount with the Renegade</p><p style="">32 - Eternal Oath</p><h3>Disc Four</h3><p style="">01 - Judgment of Mana</p><p style="">02 - Spirits Whispers</p><p style="">03 - Fun with Idol</p><p style="">04 - Fighting the Spirit</p><p style="">05 - Search a Seal ~Tethe'Alla~</p><p style="">06 - The Law of the Battle</p><p style="">07 - The End of a Thought</p><p style="">08 - Keep Your Guard Up!</p><p style="">09 - Defeat the Angel</p><p style="">10 - Edge of Nowhere</p><p style="">11 - A Sign</p><p style="">12 - Be Invoked</p><p style="">13 - Derris Kharlan ~Appear~</p><p style="">14 - Derris Kharlan ~Fear~</p><p style="">15 - Derris Kharlan ~Shine~</p><p style="">16 - Derris Kharlan ~Requiem~</p><p style="">17 - Keen-Edged Blade</p><p style="">18 - Last Battle ~Will~</p><p style="">19 - Last Battle ~Decision~</p><p style="">20 - Hidden Sorrow</p><p style="">21 - It Can Waver and Fight</p><p style="">22 - Final Destination</p><p style="">23 - Harmony</p><p style="">24 - Revival</p><p style="">25 - Ending ~Staff Rolling~</p><p style="">26 - Thank You All</p><h2>Reception</h2><p style="">Tales of Symphonia is the most popular game in the Tales franchise. The GameCube version in Japan sold below expectations, which is why Namco threw out the exclusive title and released the game on the PlayStation 2, which it sold fairly well on. Many publications gave it nominations for 2004 GameCube Game of the Year and 2004 RPG of the Year. It also prompted Namco to create a spin-off sequel to the game on the Wii, "Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of a New World", a first in the Tales franchise. It's main protagonist, Lloyd Irving, has made cameo appearances in other games like Soul Calibur Legends for the Wii.</p><h2>Localization</h2><p style="">Namco originally had no intentions of bringing Tales of Symphonia to the US. However, Nintendo later asked for Namco to bring Symphonia to the US and offered to publish the localized version. Nintendo funded the translations, voice acting, and also helped promote the game by giving it a front cover on Nintendo Power. The game went on to sell fairly well in the US. Seeing as it was published by Nintendo outside of Japan, it is highly unlikely that the PlayStation 2 version will ever be released outside of Japan.</p><h2>Other Info</h2><p style="">1 player</p><p style="">2-4 players simultaneous</p><p style="">Memory blocks needed: <b>3</b></p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>21237</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/1837515-box_tos.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/1837515-box_tos.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/1837515-box_tos.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/1837515-box_tos.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/1837515-box_tos.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1837515-box_tos.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/1837515-box_tos.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Tales of Symphonia]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>7</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-19/]]></api_detail_url><id>19</id><name><![CDATA[CERO: All Ages]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-1/]]></api_detail_url><id>1</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: T]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2004-07-13 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-19/]]></api_detail_url><id>19</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 2]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-2/3045-19/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS2]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-23/]]></api_detail_url><id>23</id><name><![CDATA[GameCube]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/gamecube/3045-23/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[GCN]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/tales-of-symphonia/3030-21237/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[mlb 2k7]]></aliases><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21255/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-07-22 22:43:46</date_added><date_last_updated>2012-03-09 16:55:43</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[The MLB 2K series returns for the 2007 season with this installment.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>New gameplay</h2><br/>Some new addition to the gameplay besides tweaked sliders and AI are:<br/><br/><b>Online Franchise</b>: Play with up to four of your friends in a franchise or season.<br/><br/><b>True Fielding</b>: Fielder positioning, relay and cutoff A.I. are redesigned to allow for better, more authentic Major League defensive play.

Originally the free release was a "concept" version for the full game Gran Turismo  HD, this was the first concept version released outside of Japan. Gran Turismo HD was released with 10 cars including Ferarris which was a first for the series, and one track The Eiger Nordwand (including reverse track ) which is in the Swiss Alps. The game featured Time Trial and Drift Trial modes and also had regional leaderboards.

The game centers around four playable characters as they each attempt to track down the Origami Killer.

In addition to the cranes, the Origami Killer also covers their victim's faces with mud and leaves an orchid on their chest. All of the victims had been drowned before the killer moved the bodies. Players control four main characters to investigate and figure out who is committing these atrocities.</p><h3>Norman Jayden</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/1034379-06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1034379" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/1034379-06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1034379"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14036/1034379-06.jpg"></a><figcaption>Norman Jayden</figcaption></figure><p style=""><a href="../../norman-jayden/94-11660/" rel="nofollow">Norman Jayden</a> is a criminal profiler for the <a href="../../agents/92-2906/" rel="nofollow">FBI</a> with additional expertise in the forensics field. He is sent to help the local police by doing a profile of the Origami Killer, but soon starts investigating the cases on his own using the hi-tech gadget ARI (Added Reality Interface) - much to the chagrin of several members of the local PD who do not like him interfering with their business. In the demo of Heavy Rain, Norman investigates a murder scene at a railway line. His investigation leads him to believe that the body was dumped by the Origami Killer. Jayden is addicted to the fictional drug Triptocaine, which plays a significant role in his part of the game. He experiences many symptoms (severe tremors, dizziness and nosebleeds) that are assumed to be related to withdrawal, but the game never really clarifies what they are from.</p><h3>Ethan Mars</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/1110366-screen003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1110366" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/1110366-screen003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1110366"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14036/1110366-screen003.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14036/1110366-screen003.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ethan Mars</figcaption></figure><p style=""><a href="../../ethan-mars/94-12115/" rel="nofollow">Ethan Mars</a> is a happily married architect and father of two sons, Jason and Shaun.

At first she sees the potential for a great story, but the longer she is with Ethan, the more emotionally invested she becomes.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">Although Heavy Rain may seem like a <a href="../../dragons-lair/61-23/" rel="nofollow">Dragon's Lair</a> type of game, the developers have expressly stated that control of the character is rarely taken away from the player. The player often has direct control of the character, and can walk around at will within a set area using the R2 Button and Left Analog Stick. There are almost no <a href="../../in-engine-cinematic/92-964/" rel="nofollow">cinematics</a> to watch. There is an investigation portion to the game - mainly when <a href="../../norman-jayden/94-11660/" rel="nofollow">Jayden</a> uses ARI at crime scenes - where the player can freely search anywhere they think they might find a hidden clue. There is another portion of the game that uses <a href="../../quick-time-event/92-6/" rel="nofollow">QTE</a>s, mostly during fast paced action sequences, to create immersion. The QTEs, however, are not static images prompting button presses, but rather are worked into the environment. At times, multiple buttons will appear on screen allowing you to choose from a number of events whose outcome is felt immediately. The <a href="/">QTE</a>s use every button on the PS3 controller (except L3, R3, the D-pad and obviously the Start and Select buttons) as well as its <a href="/sixaxis-support/3015-5310/" data-ref-id="3015-5310">SIXAXIS</a> functionality. At certain points in the game, the player is required to press a succession of buttons, holding down the previous button(s) as they press the next - these combinations are often constructed in such a way that the difficulty of what the character is trying to achieve corresponds with the physical difficulty of pressing the correct buttons (meaning that a QTE for crawling through live electricity will be much harder than a QTE for going up a hill).</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14036/1034381-07.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1034381" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14036/1034381-07.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1034381"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14036/1034381-07.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14036/1034381-07.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>"Can you stop that thing?"</figcaption></figure><p style=""><a href="../../dialogue-trees/92-77/" rel="nofollow">Dialogue trees</a> are used heavily in the games, represented by words encircling the player. The state of the words will correspond to the character's mental state - if they are in a state of panic the words can be shaking violently, making them difficult to read.

If all characters die, the plot line will still continue without the impact that those characters could have made.</p><h2>Development</h2><p style="">Development of Heavy Rain began in February of 2006 and was announced at <a href="../../e3-2006/92-3439/" rel="nofollow">E3</a> <a href="../../e3-2006/92-3439/" rel="nofollow">2006</a>, at which it was a tech demo called "The Casting". The game was originally for PC and there were to be two separate releases of the game - one for computers equipped with the appropriate physics processing unit and one for computers that didn't meet the specification. Some of the physics relied on <a href="../../physx/92-1923/" rel="nofollow">PhysX</a>. The E3 demo made use of <a href="../../ageia-technologies-inc/65-4701/" rel="nofollow">AGEIA</a> technology.</p><p style="">Noteworthy features of "The Casting" were full body motion capture along with full facial motion capture, wrinkles on faces, real time tears, advanced rendering features, and advanced skin shaders. The demo showed technology enabling pupil dilation and dynamic hair with physics. The game engine supports full real time post-processing. The facial motion capture was captured using a Vicon MX40 camera with an enhanced muscle system.</p><h2>Deleted Content</h2><p style="">During the game's development, the story had many supernatural elements. Scott and Ethan were supposed to share a mental bond that caused Ethan's blackout. Scott was also seen smothering his mother with a pillow. However, these were cut from the final version because they were not deemed suitable.</p><h2>Heavy Rain Chronicles - DLC</h2><p style="">Quantic Dream founder David Cage said 2009 in an Interview with VideoGamer.com that "<i>.. we are talking with Sony at the moment about having maybe extra downloadable content, maybe with prequels or sequels about the characters.</i>"</p><p style="">Later it was revealed that the DLC would be episodes of the so-called Heavy Rain Chronicles.</p><p style=""><u><b>Different Plans for DLC, revealed during various Interviews:</b></u></p><p style="">- <a href="/">The Taxidermist</a> (at first only available with a preorder code, later through PSN purchase - released on April 1, 2010)</p><p style="">- DLC with a focus on Norman Jayden and how he got addicted to drugs;</p><p style="">- Another episode with you taking the role of the "villain";</p><p style="">On July 2010 Cage revealed in an Interview with Eurogamer.com on subject of the Chronicles that "<i>.. they are on hold to allow the team to work on Move and on new projects, and I doubt they will ever be produced.</i>"</p><h2>PlayStation Move Version</h2><p style="">In Winter 2010, a new version of the game was released, Heavy Rain Move Edition. This version of the game integrates the <a href="/playstation-move/3000-36/" data-ref-id="3000-36">PlayStation Move</a> controller into the game, allowing full motion control of the characters' actions. Older versions of the game can be patched with a free download to integrate these Move controls. Heavy Rain Move Edition is fully playable with standard controller.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p style=""><b>Heavy Rain</b>'s soundtrack was composed by <a href="/normand-corbeil/3040-98308/" data-ref-id="3040-98308">Normand Corbeil</a> and recorded at the Abbey Road Studios in London.

The game features many new features, new cars, improved graphics, and more customization options for your cars.  <br /><br /></p><h2>Demo</h2> The demo for the Xbox 360 version of the game was released on the Xbox LIVE Marketplace on the 1 9th of July, 2007. A second, multiplayer demo was also released, on the 14th of September 2007. It seems likely that Juiced 2 may be the final game in the Juiced series, as THQ have sold the publishing rights for this game, as well as that of the <a data-ref-id="3025-320" href="/stuntman/3025-320/">Stuntman </a>franchise. <br /> <br /><h2>Single Player</h2>Single player in Juiced 2 begins with you creating your character in the game. This character will be seen when browsing the menus, in your car, and also before a race. The menu is designed to look like the inside of a nightclub, complete    <figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/32849/1319117-juiced_2_7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1319117" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.8" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/32849/1319117-juiced_2_7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1319117"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/32849/1319117-juiced_2_7.jpg"></a></figure>     with a dancer in the background. Juice Games removed the calendar and respect system from this game, so they no longer are available. The game starts you off in League 8, which is the lowest league in the game. The higher the league, the faster the cars available to you. League 8 features standard cars, such as Honda Civics. As you move up in leagues, the cars you can purchase become more exotic and have superior performance. You can also upgrade your car so that it is suitable to race in a higher league.<br /><br /> Character customization in the game is relatively basic, in comparison to some games. You select a preset character, and you can change the clothing. The character customization option is only available in the Xbox 360, Playstation 3, and PC versions of the game. In the other versions of the game, you simply don't have a character.<br /><br /> Car modification in this game is vastly increased, in comparison to the previous Juiced game. In fact, the car customization is still superior to most racing games available currently. Players are able to customize their car's license plate, add custom graphics to their cars, and customize the car's body with spoilers, bumpers, body kits, etc. The game also allows customization of your car's interior - you can customize the steering wheel (it doesn't effect handling), and the seats. <br /><br /> To move into a higher league, players must complete a certain number of the goals they are given. Some of these goals are things such as winning a certain amount from gambling on one race, winning a pink slip from a certain person, intimidating a certain driver, and other such goals. Some of the later goals given are incredibly hard, so Juiced 2 does not remain an easy game for long.<br /><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/32849/1077463-juiced_2_image.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1077463" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/32849/1077463-juiced_2_image.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1077463"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/32849/1077463-juiced_2_image.jpg"></a><figcaption>The customization aspect to Juiced 2 </figcaption></figure><br /><br /><br /><h2>Driver DNA</h2>A unique feature in Juiced 2 is 'Driver DNA'. The game will build up a DNA strand of your own unique style. Your DNA can change depending on how much nitrous you use, how much you gamble on a race, if you drive aggressively, and more. <br /> <br />There are three possible ways your Driver DNA can go : Burning (you do this a lot), Neutral, and Ice Cold. Ice Cold basically says you're a calm, collected driver, and you only drive aggressively if necessary.<a data-ref-id="3040-93468" href="/ursula-mayes/3040-93468/">   Ursula Mayes</a> is your guide to Driver DNA at the start of the game. Unsurprisingly, she has Ice Cold DNA, making her the best AI driver in the game.<br /><br /> Other players can view your DNA online before a race. They can download this DNA, and use it for a driver in their team, or race against it in the Driver DNA Lab.<br /><br /><h2>Driver DNA Lab</h2>The Driver DNA Lab in the game allows you to race against the DNA strands of your friends and competitors online, as well as allowing you to race against the DNA of different drivers. The Lab contains the DNA of several famous drivers, such as drifters. There is also a French football player you can race against. Ursula Mayes cannot be raced against in    <figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/32849/1319115-juiced_2_5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1319115" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.8" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/32849/1319115-juiced_2_5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1319115"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/32849/1319115-juiced_2_5.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/32849/1319115-juiced_2_5.jpg"></noscript></a></figure>     the Lab, despite the fact she has the best DNA of any drivers in the game.<br /><br /><h2>Soundtrack</h2><br /><h3>Racing Soundtrack</h3> <ul class="plain-list"><li>Acidecine - 16 Bit Lolitas<br /></li><li>Mind Killer  (Remix) - Adam Freeland<br /></li><li>High Speed Heist - Bruno Coon<br /></li><li>Stone Crows - Bruno Coon<br /></li><li>Lightning Strikes - Bruno Coon</li><li>Whassisface - Adam Freeland</li><li>Never Ever Enough - Adam Freeland</li><li>Hommeage - Adam Freeland</li><li>Blocks - Adam Freeland</li><li>Flourohorns - Adam Freeland</li><li>Morodish - Adam Freeland</li><li>Sg Rei - Adam Freeland</li><li>Neu!

Metacritic calculated an average score of 66, which is merely one point more than its PSP-exclusive predecessor, Juiced Eliminator received. The highest score received for the Playstation 2 version of the  game was 80/100, by the Official UK Playstation magazine.

Many improvements are subtle, but the changes and additions to College Hoops 2K8 make it the best game in the series.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style=""><a href="/2k-sports/3010-1860/" data-ref-id="3010-1860">2K Sports</a>' latest College basketball game, developed by <a href="/visual-concepts/3010-893/" data-ref-id="3010-893">Visual Concepts</a>. The game was released on the <a href="/xbox-360/3045-20/" data-ref-id="3045-20">Xbox 360</a>, and both the <a href="/playstation-2/3045-19/" data-ref-id="3045-19">Playstation 2</a> and <a href="/playstation-3/3045-35/" data-ref-id="3045-35">Playstation 3</a> on November 19, 2007. College Hoops 2K8 was the last NCAA basketball release by 2K Sports and is still being supported by the company today. Greg Oden was the featured player on the game's cover.</p><h2>Gameplay &amp; Presentation</h2><p style="">Gameplay was slightly modified through the "Maximum Passing" feature. This allowed the player to pass to any on-court teammate at any time, with varying degrees of skill. "PlayVision" was also added, allowing players to run the team as a coach sees it, with the proverbial "X's and O's" sprawled out on the court during game play. The infamous "Lock-On Defense" from the 2K basketball series' was added to 2K8 as well, allowing players to guard a player with ease; by pressing one button and holding it down.</p><p style="">Presentation was slightly changed, mostly in the manner that coaches were not named in the game. This is because 2K did not have the rights to publish the official coaches in-game, and therefore they are referred to as "coach". The announcers for the game were the same as in the past, featuring Verne Lundquist and Bill Raftery.</p><p style="">Albeit the game only comes with the 2008 college rosters, many unofficial rosters have been released each respective year since release by other members of the community via the 2K Share feature.</p><p style="">The game also suffered from frame rate issues on the Playstation 3, particularly when the vast amount of <a href="/polygonal-3d/3015-1430/" data-ref-id="3015-1430">polygonal models</a> in the crowd stood up.</p><h2>Improvements for the 2008 Season</h2><p style=""><b>All-American Training Challenge</b></p><p style="">Improve your game skills in the All-American Training Challenge. The all-new practice mode pits you against some of college basketball's greats to test key passing, shooting, and defensive abilities in a series of drills and duels. Challenge the likes of Mike Conley, Glen Davis, Greg Oden, J.J. Redick, Al Thornton, Alando Tucker and Julian Wright to complete each drill and advance to the next challenge. Track your high scores and best times to measure your improvement, or compare stats against other aspiring All-Americans in multiplayer mode.</p><p style=""><b>6th Man Advantage</b></p><p style="">Excite your home team crowd like never before. Get the energy of your fans behind you to fill up the 6th Man Meter. Once it is full, your team will get a surge of strength, confidence and hustle while your opponent's confidence will be rattled.</p><p style=""><b>Play Designer</b></p><p style="">Got a new play on your sleeve? Play Designer allows you to create your own plays and run them exactly the way you want to. Save your plays into a custom playbook and use that playbook to your advantage.</p><p style=""><b>Improved Legacy Mode</b></p><p style="">College Hoops 2K8 over-delivers on Legacy Mode as always, adding such exclusives features as Amateur Basketball Leagues, Create-a-Recruit, user controlled player progression and more.</p><p style=""><b>2K Share</b></p><p style="">2K Share lets you save and swap your customized settings with friends online. Create your own rosters, school chants, customized playbooks, Legacy files, and game sliders, then share them with other players to expand your all-around college experience.</p><h2>Game Modes</h2><p style=""><b>Legacy</b></p><p style="">With Legacy mode you can create a new legacy or load an existing one, labeled through either "Open Legacy" or "Career Legacy", respectively. In Career Legacy the goal is to take a relatively unknown team and improve them until they are national champions. In Open Legacy the player can enroll in any school and begin their basketball journey. Both modes allow you to recruit players from the High School level.</p><p style=""><b>Pontiac Tournament</b></p><p style="">Create a new tournament and see who can make it to the final game. Do you have what it takes to lead your squad to the championship?</p><p style=""><b>College Hoops Classic</b></p><p style="">Live this premiere preseason tournament with the four exciting host schools - UCONN, Memphis, Kentucky, and Oklahoma.</p><p style=""><b>All-American Training Challenge</b></p><p style="">See the New for College Hoops 2K8 section for more information on the All-American Training Challenge.</p><p style=""><b>Coach Mode</b></p><p style="">This mode is based on your skills as a coach rather than your skills on the court. Are you the floor general that can lead your school to victory?</p><p style=""><b>Tutorial</b></p><p style="">Follow the instructions that teach you how to do each move in the game and master the control scheme.</p><p style=""><b>Practice</b></p><p style="">Work on your game in Practice mode. Run plays and find out how to best use your team.</p><h2>Discontinuation</h2><p style="">In 2008, 2K Sports announced that it had declined the option to pursue the license for any future releases and was discontinuing the series, citing low sales. This led to EA Sports acquiring the college basketball license.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>21317</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/2250676-box_ch2k8.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/2250676-box_ch2k8.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/2250676-box_ch2k8.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/2250676-box_ch2k8.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/2250676-box_ch2k8.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2250676-box_ch2k8.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/2250676-box_ch2k8.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[College Hoops 2K8]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-6/]]></api_detail_url><id>6</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: E]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2007-11-19 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-19/]]></api_detail_url><id>19</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 2]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-2/3045-19/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS2]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/college-hoops-2k8/3030-21317/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[NHL 2009]]></aliases><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21320/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-07-23 17:55:55</date_added><date_last_updated>2013-01-27 17:40:16</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[NHL 09 adds major improvements to the franchise, such as the defense skill stick and the highly praised Be A Pro Mode, to make this sports game one of the best of 2008.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>New Features</h2><h3>Skill Stick</h3><p style="">Introduced in <a data-ref-id="3030-5224" href="/nhl-07/3030-5224/" slug="nhl-07">NHL 07</a>, the Skill Stick is a revolutionary system that <a data-ref-id="3010-6255" href="/ea-sports/3010-6255/" slug="ea-sports">EA</a> has built upon in this years release of NHL. The original Skill Stick from the previous years was only useful against goalies, usually of breakaways, penalty shot</p><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8918/344492-hossa2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-344492" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8918/344492-hossa2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-344492"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/8918/344492-hossa2.jpg"></a><figcaption>Krik Maltby ready to perform the windmill deke on Adam Foote.</figcaption></figure><p style="">s, or shootout situations. This year the Skill Stick gets a much needed upgrade, nearly adding triple the moves on top of <a data-ref-id="3030-18227" href="/nhl-08/3030-18227/" slug="nhl-08">NHL 08</a>. The all new features allows players to deke all of the players on the ice, using a variety of moves from the windmill to the famous Datsyuk move. For example, now one-handed dekes are available for use.</p><p style="">To balance the new Skill Stick features introduces the Defensive Skill Stick, this allows defencemen to sweep the puck either manually or automatically to knock the puck loose from the offensive skaters possession. Players can also stick lift to prevent some key passes that can lead to goals against, this doesn't come without consequences though, a poorly places stick lift or excessive use can lead to either a high-sticking or slashing penalty. The Defensive Skill Stick is the developers response to the all too frequent hitting and unrealistic play as the result of poor defensive strategies. The hit system still uses the skill stick but is more realistic compared to previous editions.</p><p style="">To promote a mix-up of offensive strategies and realistic play, players can also flip the puck in the air for the first time in any NHL game; however, a poorly aimed attempt to flip the puck out of the defensive zone can result in a delay of game penalty if the puck happens to make its way into the stand.</p><h3>Checking/Fighting</h3><p style="">A new fighting engine has been introduced, switching from confusing stick controls to a few simple buttons. This makes fighting much shorter and easier for most of the new gamers. Winning a fight can cause a momentum boost for your team, or drain the home crowd's morale if you are the visiting team. Many fans of the franchise are still hoping for a proper fighting system in the near future. The new checking system now allows players to check their opponents by flicking the analog stick at which direction their opponent is facing. The new checking engine adds for a more realistic gaming experience with checking not being as dominant as previous NHL games.</p><h3>Be a Pro Mode</h3><p style="">One of the most anticipated new features of NHL 09 is the brand new 'Be a Pro Mode' which allows gamers to create a hockey player from scratch or take over an existing players career. After creating the player, the user can choose a hockey team to join and will immediately be placed on the third line or become the starting goalie of the corresponding AHL franchise. At the end of each game played, the player is graded in several different categories on their performance, the better a person plays the faster they will rise to the ranks and become either the starting goalie or be placed on the first line of the NHL team, players can also be demoted if performance is slipping, much like in the real NHL.</p><h3>EA Sports Hockey League - EASHL</h3><p style="">NHL 09 brings gaming online to the next level, any group of people can join up with their custom Be a Pro players and create a team online to compete against thousands of other players. This online mode supports 6 on 6 play and each team can hold a maximum of 50 players.</p><p style="">The EASHL is split into several divisions, with the best teams in the world competing in Division 1, and progressively downward from there. The teams are ranked by their wins and the goal of the EASHL is to win the EASHL Cup at the end o f the season. Teams can also earn different trophies, similar to <a data-ref-id="3055-1229" href="/xbox-360/3055-1229/" slug="xbox-360">Xbox 360</a>'s <a data-ref-id="3015-29" href="/achievements/3015-29/" slug="achievements">achievements</a> and the <a data-ref-id="3055-1463" href="/playstation-3/3055-1463/" slug="playstation-3">Playstation 3</a>'s <a data-ref-id="3015-198" href="/playstation-trophies/3015-198/" slug="playstation-trophies">trophy</a> system.</p><h3>NHL '94 Controls</h3><p style="">Compensating for the new control scheme which has an above average learning curve, EA Sports has decided to import the controls from <a data-ref-id="3030-20166" href="/nhl-94/3030-20166/" slug="nhl-94">NHL 94</a>. These controls take place over the skill stick and more complicated features and give players more use of the face buttons such as 'A' and 'B' on the <a data-ref-id="3055-1229" href="/xbox-360/3055-1229/" slug="xbox-360">Xbox 360</a> and 'X' and 'O' on the <a data-ref-id="3055-1463" href="/playstation-3/3055-1463/" slug="playstation-3">Playstation 3</a>. Although these controls are much easier for a beginner, they are handicapped in the form that they are unable to perform any of the skill stick moves and are unable to stick lift or flip the puck.</p><h3>European Elite Leagues</h3><p style=""><a data-ref-id="3010-6255" href="/ea-sports/3010-6255/" slug="ea-sports">EA Sports</a> expanded on the foreign leagues this year by adding the Swedish Elitserien, Russian Super League, Czech Extraliga, German DEL, and Finnish SM-Ligia to NHL 09.</p><h3>Alternate Jerseys</h3><p style="">For the 2008-09 NHL season teams began to showcase their new RBK Edge third jerseys. The last team to unveil their alternate jersey was the Boston Bruins on November 24th, 2008. The alternate jersey code was released to the public on December 9th, 2008 and has since been added automatically to anybody who has downloaded a roster update since then.</p><ul><li>The alternate jersy code is <b><i>xe6377uyrwm48frf</i></b>.</li></ul><h3>Custom Sounds in Game</h3><p style="">For 360 exclusively EA sports added a feature to add your own pregame song, and goal song for each team. This did cause a little bit of controversy since it could of been added to the PS3 as well either at launch or through patch. Didn't cause a whole lot of anger however. It is likely that NHL '10 will feature the custom soundtrack on both systems.</p><h2>Demo</h2><p style="">The demo for NHL 09 was released on the <a data-ref-id="3015-2623" href="/playstation-network/3015-2623/" slug="playstation-network">Playstation Network</a> on August 28th, 2008 and shortly after on September 3rd, 2008 on the <a data-ref-id="3015-1404" href="/xbox-live/3015-1404/" slug="xbox-live">Xbox Live Marketplace</a>. The demo featured tutorials for shooting, deking, and the new defensive stick. One of the two available game modes is a simple exhibition game where a player can decide to play in the third period as either the Pittsburgh Penguins or the Detroit Red Wings.

The game was developed by Russian developer <a data-ref-id="3010-6419" href="/gaijin-entertainment/3010-6419/">Gaijin Entertainment</a> and published by <a data-ref-id="3010-1187" href="/southpeak-interactive-llc/3010-1187/">SouthPeak Interactive</a> in the US and <a data-ref-id="3010-106" href="/topware-interactive/3010-106/">TopWare Interactive</a> in Europe. It was already released in December, 2007 by <a data-ref-id="3010-322" href="/1c-company/3010-322/">1C Company</a> in the Russian language only for Microsoft Windows PC's under the title <b>Oniblade</b>. The game gives you control of a scantily clad female heroine by the name of Ayumi, and she is a proficient <a data-ref-id="3055-314" href="/gunblade/3055-314/">gunblade</a> user.</p><p style="">The Japanese box art for the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 only differs in the coverage provided by Ayumi's underwear. In the 360 version of the game, more exposed flesh is shown. Sony requested Gaijin to change the image a bit and Gaijin obliged.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style="">Ayumi is an adventurous relic hunter in search of an artifact believed to hold the fate of the world in its grasp. Hidden ages ago by a fearful king, the magical orb is the object of curiosity, ambition, and fear from those few who know of its existence. But there are those, like Ayumi, that would stop at nothing to harness the power of this orb and use it to gain fame, power, and fortune. Relying only on her fighting skill, pistol blades, and magical abilities, Ayumi must endure countless battles against creatures and other fortune-seekers determined to prevent her from escaping with the relic alive.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">When Ayumi isn't using her effective combat spells, she faces up to the enemy hordes with naked blades and explosive projectiles. Since the unique Gunblades are a combination of sword and pistol, the heroine can change her combat style lightning-fast. Surrounded by countless opponents, Ayumi uses both blades with deadly accuracy in hand-to-hand combat. She's well versed in various combat techniques - and she makes full use of them to cut her way through the ranks of the monsters. The player is rewarded with special finishing moves for carrying out particularly successful combos. However, Ayumi must first learn powerful attacking techniques by collecting hidden coin fragments throughout the levels. One three-piece set of these silver, gold or ruby artifacts releases a long-range or close combat upgrade.</p><h2>Endings</h2><p style="">There are two different endings in the video game X-blades. Depending on the player's actions during the game, the player will receive either a "good" or "evil" ending. There is not a separate ending for players who try to to go down a neutral path.</p><h2>Xbox 360 Installation</h2><p style="">The amount of memory it takes to install this game is 2.0 GB.</p><h2>PC System Requirements</h2><ul><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows XP SP 2/Vista</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Pentium 4 @ 1.5 GHz or Equivalent</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 256 MB RAM</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> 128 MB (ATI Radeon/nVidia GeForce 6600)</li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong>9.0c</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong> 5 GB Free</li></ul>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>21348</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/2151667-box_xb.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/2151667-box_xb.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/2151667-box_xb.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/2151667-box_xb.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/2151667-box_xb.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2151667-box_xb.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/2151667-box_xb.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[X-Blades]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>6</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-16/]]></api_detail_url><id>16</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: M]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-36/]]></api_detail_url><id>36</id><name><![CDATA[PEGI: 12+]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-32/]]></api_detail_url><id>32</id><name><![CDATA[CERO: D]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2009-02-10 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-86/]]></api_detail_url><id>86</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360 Games Store]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360-games-store/3045-86/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[XBGS]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/x-blades/3030-21348/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[Deus Ex 3

Through the use of mechanical augmentations, the world can be navigated using stealth, lethal or non-lethal combat, social interaction and a variety of other approaches.</p><p style="">The game was developed by <a href="../../eidos-studios-montreal/65-6462/" rel="nofollow">Eidos Montreal</a> and was released on August 23rd, 2011 in North America, August 25th in Australia and August 26th in Europe.</p><p style="">At <a href="/pax-east-2013/3015-7348/" data-ref-id="3015-7348">PAX East 2013</a>, Square Enix revealed <a href="/deus-ex-human-revolution-directors-cut/3030-42021/" data-ref-id="3030-42021">Deus Ex: Human Revolution (Director's Cut)</a>, an enhanced <a href="/wii-u/3045-139/" data-ref-id="3045-139">Wii U</a> port of the game that had been rumored for many months.

The game deals with the idea of post-humanism, which is a cultural movement that supports the use of technology and science to improve the physical and mental capabilities of Humans.</p><p style="">The visuals are unique in that they combine elements of Renaissance and <a href="../../cyberpunk/92-6735/" rel="nofollow">cyberpunk</a> aesthetics. In the game, those that support the idea of augmentations decorate their homes and themselves in a kind of late-medieval Italian style, while those that are against it dress like normal human beings.</p><p style="">Apart from the post-humanism and cyberpunk themes, the game also focuses on human nature, mass media and conspiracy theories. During the mission in <a href="../../montreal/95-1544/" rel="nofollow">Montreal</a> in which <a href="../../adam-jensen/94-8675/" rel="nofollow">Adam Jensen</a> infiltrates a major news station, he finds the way journalists view their profession. They describe themselves as people who bring the news to the general population, and this allows them to change the news any way they want, so that they may control the opinions of the majority of people.</p><p style="">Conspiracy theories have been a prominent theme of Deus Ex games, in Human Revolution players can hear about several groups, most notably the <a href="../../illuminati/92-2875/" rel="nofollow">Illuminati</a> and the Bilderberg group.</p><h3>Story</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1868022-2011_08_23_00020.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1868022" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.56222547584187" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1868022-2011_08_23_00020.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1868022"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3661/1868022-2011_08_23_00020.jpg"></a><figcaption>Jensen's near-death experience.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Human Revolution takes place in 2027 and has the player play as <a href="../../adam-jensen/94-8675/" rel="nofollow">Adam Jensen</a>, head of security at <a href="../../sarif-industries/92-7222/" rel="nofollow">Sarif Industries</a>. The game starts with Adam charged with planning a trip for <a href="../../megan-reed/94-20110/" rel="nofollow">Megan Reed</a> to Washington DC where she is to present some kind of scientific breakthrough to congress. <a href="../../megan-reed/94-20110/" rel="nofollow">Megan</a>, other than being a brilliant scientist, is also Adam's love interest.

But before she can explain what dirty deed she has done, the couple is interrupted by <a href="../../frank-pritchard/94-18651/" rel="nofollow">Frank Pritchard</a> and Adam is forced to go and talk to <a href="../../david-sarif/94-18652/" rel="nofollow">David Sarif</a> about the security plan for DC while Megan gets back to work.

He's seen in great pain, getting new augmented legs and arms. After the painful scene, the game flashes forward 6 months where Adam, fresh out of hospital, has reprised his job as chief of security. Things rapidly heat up when a terrorist group called <a href="../../purity-first/92-7224/" rel="nofollow">Purity First</a> takes a bunch of hostages in Sarif owned factory. <a href="../../david-sarif/94-18652/" rel="nofollow">David Sarif</a> explains that a top secret military weapon called the Typhoon is in the warehouse and must be secured. Adam sets out to secure the device and along the way discovers an augmented terrorist downloading top secret information. Before he can interrogate him, the young terrorist commits suicide as he pleaded for help. Adam eventually confronts the head of <a href="../../purity-first/92-7224/" rel="nofollow">Purity First</a>, Zeke Sanders who denies the augmented terrorist being his, explaining that his plan is to stop all future augmentations. Sanders escapes while Sarif asks <a href="../../adam-jensen/94-8675/" rel="nofollow">Adam</a> to investigate on the augmented terrorist. After sneaking into the morgue, Adam discovers that the terrorist was being controlled from afar from a mysterious third party, believed at the time to be on of <a href="../../sarif-industries/92-7222/" rel="nofollow">Sarif Industries</a> competitors due to a massive security leak that <a href="../../david-sarif/94-18652/" rel="nofollow">David Sarif</a> was fully aware of.</p><p style="">Adam heads to the abandoned FEMA warehouse where the terrorist was being controlled from. There, he discovers the same augmented terrorists that had attacked Sarif Industries 6 months prior. The plot thickens as Adam wonders if Sarif Industries isn't supplying the terrorist despite the fact that David Sarif denies this by explaining that Sarif Industries almost only does military contracts when it comes to weapons. The biggest suspect becomes FEMA one of Sarif's Competitors. Adam confronts one of the terrorist, Lawrence Barrett, whom after being defeated, explains to Adam that Belltower doesn't give a damn about a rotting company like Sarif Industries and that what this shadow group of terrorists is planning is much bigger. Right before commiting suicide, the terrorist gives Adam an adress in Hengsha, China where Adam can find the hacker who controlled the Purity First terrorist.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1871737-2011_08_25_00002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1871737" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.56222547584187" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1871737-2011_08_25_00002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1871737"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3661/1871737-2011_08_25_00002.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3661/1871737-2011_08_25_00002.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>DXHR makes heavy use of emails and e-newspapers to expand &amp; deliver its narrative</figcaption></figure><p style="">Upon arriving, Adam realizes that he's not the only one after this hacker who is on the run: Belltower Associates, a PMC contracted by the chinese government also wants the hacker's head. Adam gets to him first though and he is revealed to be Arie van Bruggen. Bruggen instantly admits to having controlled and murdered the Purity soldier, claiming that he was hired by one of Sarif Industries' biggest rivals: Tai Yong Medical. He claims that he has a recording of TYM's CEO Yun Ru talking to the terrorists who attacked Sarif Industries and he claims that TYM is doing this to eliminate its competitors (TYM is seen doing this to its Scottish competitor by tampering with their stocks). The recording is at the TYM headquarters and after pirating a badge, Adam infiltrates it. He eventually gets the recording and makes an even greater discovery: Megan and her research team aren't dead, instead the attack on Sarif Industries six months prior was a diversion to kidnap them. Wanting to know more, Adam interrogates TYM's CEO who denies having anything to do with the kidnapping, telling him to investigate Picus News (an international news channel that is featured prominently throughout the game) before locking herself in a panic room and calling security. Jensen escapes and heads for the Picus building back in Montreal.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1868009-2011_08_23_00007.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1868009" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.56222547584187" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1868009-2011_08_23_00007.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1868009"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3661/1868009-2011_08_23_00007.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3661/1868009-2011_08_23_00007.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Picus News reports on the issues permeating Detroit in 2027</figcaption></figure><p style="">Adam infiltrates the Picus News building only to find it deserted. He speaks to a hologram of famous news host <a href="../../eliza-cassan/94-22607/" rel="nofollow">Eliza Cassan</a> who reveals that she's the one who tampered with the GPL signals the night of the kidnapping so the scientists could not be tracked. She claims that she regrets what she did but can't tell Adam anything. Jensen follows a signal to where the real <a href="../../eliza-cassan/94-22607/" rel="nofollow">Cassan</a> is hiding only to find out that <a href="../../eliza-cassan/94-22607/" rel="nofollow">Cassan</a> is an AI programmed by mysterious people who wish to shape the world. Adam fights <a href="../../yelena-fedorova/94-20617/" rel="nofollow">Yelena Fedorova</a>, one of the mercenaries from the kidnapping. After defeating her, Cassan explains that she does not have the free will to reveal everything to Adam. However she reveals that Doctor <a href="../../isaias-sandoval/94-20135/" rel="nofollow">Isaias Sandoval</a> operated on the scientists following the kidnapping to remove their GPLs. The good doctor happens to be a close associate to the pro-human politician Bill Taggart. Cassan also reveals that David Sarif was aware of all these things.</p><p style="">Adam heads back to <a href="../../detroit/95-1310/" rel="nofollow">Detroit</a> as it burns due to anti-augmentation riots. He meets immediately with Sarif who begins to shed some light on the situation. The men pulling the strings call themselves Illuminati (among other monikers.) They hired and planned the attack on Sarif industries as Megan had figured out a way on how to create augmentations that were not rejected by the body, thus eliminating the need for Neuropozyne. <a href="../../illuminati/92-2875/" rel="nofollow">The Illuminati</a>, realizing that this would make humanity too powerful to control, decided to make the scientists disappear. After these revelations, Adam interrogates <a href="../../william-taggart/94-20134/" rel="nofollow">Taggart</a> on the location of his associate. Taggart, after much resistance, tells Adam where to go and fears his associate, <a href="../../isaias-sandoval/94-20135/" rel="nofollow">Isaias Sandoval</a>, may have gone the same path as his brother, Zeke Sanders. Adam finds the doctor hiding in the Detroit sewers, who reveals that he failed in removing the GPL implants that the scientists had, but due to their weak signal strength, Sarif's engineers would overlook their broadcast. David Sarif pulls some strings at the Department of Defence in order to trace one of the GPLs to China. However, the fact that he pulled those strings would tip off the conspirators and allow them to prepare for Jensen's return to <a href="../../hengsha/95-3871/" rel="nofollow">Heng Sha</a>.</p><p style="">Despite the obvious trap laid out in front of them, <a href="../../adam-jensen/94-8675/" rel="nofollow">Jensen</a> and <a href="../../faridah-malik/94-20109/" rel="nofollow">Malik</a> return to the island city to investigate the GPL signal they had traced. Before landing, they are contacted by the Chinese authorities who instruct them to redirect their course to a different landing site. The thought of ignoring this instruction is briefly entertained, but Malik complies so as to not provoke an incident. This fails, as a surface-to-air missile with an EMP warhead is fired at them, and they plummet to the ground below. Jensen manages to jump before impact, but the VTOL crash lands into a construction site. Belltower mercenaries start to close in. Depending on the player's actions, Malik is either able to regain control and functionality of the VTOL and escape, or is overwhelmed by the mercs and dies in an explosion. Either way, Jensen manages to escape the ambush, but Belltower is still actively looking for him in the streets of the city.</p><p style="">As he makes his way to the GPL signal, Adam and several other augmented citizens experience a painful event which is promptly explained to be a glitch in one of the components of their neural interfaces. According to Tai Yong Medical and Picus News, augmented citizens are encouraged to visit their local LIMB clinics to receive an "upgrade" which will supposedly be immune to this problem. The player has the option of heeding or ignoring this advice, and Jensen can continue with his malfunctioning interface or get a new one.</p><p style="">The GPL signal eventually leads Adam to an abandoned underground parking garage that now serves as a base for a local gang known as the Harvesters. Upon infiltrating the structure, he finds the source to be Tong Si Hung, who had previously assisted Jensen in tracking down Arie van Bruggen (whether or not he was aware of that fact.) Tong is in the process of grafting on a new arm, which had been given to him by Belltower to help appease him. The arm itself had once belonged to Vasili Sevchenko, one of the scientists who had been kidnapped, and his GPL had led Jensen straight to Tong's location. Though the GPL signal seems to be a dead end, Tong proposes that Jensen infiltrates the nearby dockyard to determine the destination of Belltower's human trafficking operation. Jensen agrees to set off a bomb in the offices of the dockyard's foreman, which would send a message for Tong to the authorities while simultaneously providing Jensen a distraction to allow him to stow away on one of their ships. Upon detonating the explosive, Jensen quickly realizes that the explosion was not only a distraction to help him, but also to give Tong's kidnapped son, Tracer, an opportunity to escape and flee to Hong Kong. Jensen stows himself inside a shipping container with a stasis pod inside, notifies Pritchard that he'll probably be offline for an indeterminate length of time, then freezes himself.</p><p style="">Jensen awakes again several days later, and rapidly re-establishes contact with Pritchard. They determine that he is currently somewhere in Singapore, and that a jamming signal is making it difficult to track his location. As he explores the facility, Jensen encounters the other missing scientists (with the exception of Megan Reed and Sevchenko, the latter of which had apparently been attempting to orchestrate an escape attempt before being killed.) Each of the scientists is working in isolation from one another, but Jensen manages to find a way to coordinate a plan. In order to reach the high-security area where Megan is being held, he instructs the scientists to coordinate a series of staged lab accidents to draw away several of the guards. He also uploads a virus to the facility's systems that was being developed by Sevchenko to disable the facility's ability to track the kidnapped scientists' GPL locators, enabling them to elude their captors. Upon gaining entry to the high-security building, Jensen finds himself in another confrontation with Zhao Yun Ru. She attempts to lock down Jensen's augmentations with a remote control. If the player opted to get the replacement neural interface at a LIMB clinic, then many of Jensen's augmentations are disabled during the following fight. If not, then the remote has no effect, and Zhao is forced to escape more rapidly before the fight occurs. Whatever the case, Jensen is then confronted by Jaron Namir, the leader of the Tyrants and the individual who nearly killed him during the attack on Sarif Industries.</p><p style="">After Jaron is dealt with, Jensen proceeds to find Megan, who has seemingly grown to enjoy her position working for <a href="../../hugh-darrow/94-20133/" rel="nofollow">Hugh Darrow</a>, who is revealed to be a member of the Illuminati. There is a bitter confrontation, but Megan eventually agrees to escape with the other scientists. If <a href="../../faridah-malik/94-20109/" rel="nofollow">Malik</a> survived the crash in <a href="../../hengsha/95-3871/" rel="nofollow">Heng Sha</a>, she arrives to extract the scientists from the facility's helipad.</p><p style=""><a href="../../adam-jensen/94-8675/" rel="nofollow">Jensen</a> attempts to get <a href="../../frank-pritchard/94-18651/" rel="nofollow">Pritchard</a> to warn <a href="../../david-sarif/94-18652/" rel="nofollow">David Sarif</a> about <a href="../../hugh-darrow/94-20133/" rel="nofollow">Hugh Darrow's</a> involvement with the attack on <a href="../../sarif-industries/92-7222/" rel="nofollow">Sarif Industries</a>, but the revelation comes too late. Sarif, along with <a href="../../william-taggart/94-20134/" rel="nofollow">Bill Taggart</a> and several delegates of the United Nations have been invited to tour Hugh's mega-project, <a href="../../panchaea/95-3872/" rel="nofollow">Panchaea</a>, a colossal structure designed to seed the Earth's oceans with iron in order to help combat global warming. During the speech that Darrow gives on live television, he mentions that he has deliberated with David Sarif about the potential that augmented humans have, then abruptly triggers a broadcast system that takes the killswitch the Illuminati had been developing (which Zhao had attempted to use against Jensen earlier) and changes it to drive any augmented people into a berserk frenzy rather than shutting down. Considering that every worker on Panchaea was augmented, the location is quickly plunged into chaos and violence. SImilar outbursts occur at several other locations around the globe, though Jensen is effectively immune for various reasons (depending on earlier player choices.)</p><p style="">It is quickly determined that Jensen needs to reach <a href="../../panchaea/95-3872/" rel="nofollow">Panchaea</a> to shut the signal down (and save Sarif, if possible.) To do this, he utilizes a specialized transport system at the facility that allows him to reach Panchaea (located somewhere in the Arctic Ocean) in a matter of minutes. Shortly after arrival, he confronts Hugh Darrow and disables the lockdown protocol, questioning him on why the inventor of the first augmentations would want to make them seem unreliable and untrustworthy. Jensen learns that Hugh sought to show the world the dangers of augmentation in order to prevent the Illuminati from using his invention to control the world's population, though a degree of jealousy may also be involved due to the fact that Hugh's body rejects augmentations entirely, regardless of Neuropozyne.</p><p style="">Jensen eventually makes his way down the the base of Panchaea, situated on the ocean's floor, where the signal is being broadcast from. On his way down, he might encounter David Sarif and Bill Taggart, bunkered down with their entourages in different parts of the structure. Bill reveals that the Illuminati only wanted heavy restrictions on human augmentation rather than a full-scale ban. Knowing that Jensen is headed for the broadcast system, Taggart asks him to claim that a tainted batch of Neuropozyne was what triggered the outburst and that Versalife, not the Illuminati, should be held responsible when he reaches his destination. Sarif also asks Jenson to change the story and to claim that the outburst was triggered by a virus designed by Humanity Front in order to demonize anti-augmentation advocates and garner sympathy for biotech corporations and augmented humans.</p><p style="">Before reaching the broadcast system, Jensen must first pass through the Hyron core; a computing system designed to help Panchaea deal with the tremendous amount of varying forces being exerted by ocean currents on the structure. However, rather than being a conventional mainframe, it turns out that Hyron uses living people as system resources in order to process the vast numbers of calculations required to keep the structure from imploding or being knocked off-balance from the surrounding ocean pressure. Zhao makes another appearance and attempts to merge with Hyron to take control of the structure (and the broadcast signal.) However, the task seems to be more than she can handle, and as Jensen goes about disabling the other components of Hyron, all the processing tasks are rerouted to Zhou's brain which is quickly overwhelmed. Jensen finishes her off, then makes his way to the broadcast system's control room.</p><p style="">Waiting for him there is <a href="../../eliza-cassan/94-22607/" rel="nofollow">Eliza Cassan</a>, who states that she observed the entire situation after the live speech made by Hugh devolved into violence. She presents Jensen four options: she can present the truth of the situation to the world, including <a href="../../hugh-darrow/94-20133/" rel="nofollow">Hugh Darrow's</a> involvement in the outburst and the details about the <a href="../../illuminati/92-2875/" rel="nofollow">Illuminati</a>. Alternatively, she can cover up the Illuminati's involvement and shift the blame to a tainted batch of Neuropozyne (as per <a href="../../william-taggart/94-20134/" rel="nofollow">Bill Taggart's</a> recommendation.) A third option is to pin the blame on Humanity Front and other anti-augmentation supporters (as per <a href="../../david-sarif/94-18652/" rel="nofollow">David Sarif's</a> recommendation.) Finally, <a href="../../eliza-cassan/94-22607/" rel="nofollow">Eliza</a> suggests a fourth course of action: to allow Hyron to fail, which would cause <a href="../../panchaea/95-3872/" rel="nofollow">Panchaea</a> to implode and everyone inside (including Jensen) to die, leaving no one left behind to "spin the story."

While fighting, weapons use unique types of ammunition that can eventually be upgraded, and players can perform takedown moves up close on enemies.</p><h3><b>Weapon Selection</b></h3><p style="">Players have the option to choose from an assortment of weapons, highlighting the ability to combat enemies with lethal or non-lethal force:</p><p style=""><b>Handguns</b>:</p><ul><li><strong>Diamond Back .357</strong> (magnum revolver)</li><li><strong>P.E.P.S</strong> (<strong>P</strong>ulsed <strong>E</strong>nergy <strong>P</strong>rojection <strong>S</strong>ystem)</li><li><strong>Xbow XHII</strong> (compact crossbow)</li><li><strong>Zenith</strong> (semi-auto pistol)</li><li><strong>Buzzkill TND</strong> [<em><strong>T</strong>hreat <strong>N</strong>egation <strong>D</strong>evice</em>] (stun gun)</li></ul><p style=""><b>Rifles</b>:</p><ul><li><strong>FR-27 S.F.R.</strong> [<em><strong>S</strong>anction <strong>F</strong>lechette <strong>R</strong>ifle</em>] (combat rifle)</li><li><strong>Huntsman Silverback</strong> (double-barrel shotgun)</li><li><strong>Hurricane TMP-18 </strong>[<em><strong>T</strong>actical <strong>M</strong>achine <strong>P</strong>istol</em>] (submachine gun)</li><li><strong>Longsword Whisperhead SERSR</strong> [<em><strong>S</strong>uppressed <strong>E</strong>xtreme <strong>R</strong>ange <strong>S</strong>niper <strong>R</strong>ifle</em>] (suppressed sniper rifle)</li><li><strong>Longsword 202 'ERaSeR'</strong> [<em><strong>E</strong>xtreme <strong>R</strong>ange <strong>S</strong>niper <strong>R</strong>ifle</em>] (sniper rifle)</li><li><strong>Widowmaker TX</strong> (tactical shotgun)</li><li><strong>PAX-22</strong> (tranquilizer rifle)</li></ul><p style=""><b>Heavy</b>:</p><ul><li><strong>329-Series MPRS </strong>(rocket launcher)</li><li><strong>M404</strong> (heavy rifle)</li><li><strong>Linebacker G-87 MSGL</strong> [<em><strong>M</strong>ultiple <strong>S</strong>hot <strong>G</strong>renade <strong>L</strong>auncher</em>] (grenade launcher)</li><li><b>LS-66 Sabre DER </b>[<em><strong>D</strong>irect <strong>E</strong>nergy <strong>R</strong>ifle</em>] (laser rifle)</li><li><strong>Hi-NRG Plasma Lance </strong>(plasma rifle)</li></ul><p style=""><b>Explosives</b>:</p><ul><li><b>Pulsar Type E Electromag Grenade </b>(EMP grenade)</li><li><strong>Shok-Tac Version V</strong> (concussion grenade)</li><li><strong>E.C.D.A.

This was a controversial decision, as it was met with open hostility by fans. According to the developers, having health packs would eventually force players to stop advancing through the game, as they would need to scour through the level in search of medical supplies, and that such behavior would break the tension and natural flow of the game. The developers have stated that the regenerating health system is dissimilar to those found in modern mainstream shooter games, and that there are health items to expedite the regeneration period.</p><h3><b>NPC Interactions</b></h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1868036-2011_08_23_00035.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1868036" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.56222547584187" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1868036-2011_08_23_00035.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1868036"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3661/1868036-2011_08_23_00035.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3661/1868036-2011_08_23_00035.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Dialogue can often be used to avoid casualties</figcaption></figure><p style="">Players are able to interact with any NPC they encounter in the game.

Hacking is done via a short minigame where the player moves through a network of nodes to reach the main terminal which de-activates the computer's defenses. Each terminal has a number next to it representing the hack's difficulty rating and the game warns the player what the odds are to successfully hack the terminal without getting caught. To even attempt hacking a terminal over the security rating 1, players need to have one of the hacking augmentation upgraded minimum to that number of the terminal. If the player gets caught, they will have a limited amount of time before the security system tracks where they are hacking from and alerts the guards of their position. If the player is detected, he can do several things: use either an item that stops the detection-timer for a few seconds or another item called nuke that instantly hacks a node in hopes of hacking the computer/terminal before the security finds the player's location. The Nuke can be used to grab a node instantly with a 0% risk of being detected. He can also just disconnect the hack and lose a try. Despite the depth of the minigame, hacking is almost never absolutely required for story purposes, and can generally be bypassed with passwords or with the pre-order exclusive Automatic Unlocking Device.</p><h2>Difficulty Settings</h2><p style="">Deus Ex: Human Revolution features three selectable difficulty settings. There are named as follows: Tell Me a Story, Give Me a Challenge, and Give Me Deus Ex and they represent Easy, Normal and Hard modes, respectively. AI behavior is not affected by Difficulty changes. It behaves the same on all different difficulty levels.</p><h3>Difficulty Changes</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Easy</th><th>Normal (Base Value)</th><th>Hard</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Player Health</td><td>150%</td><td>100% (100)</td><td>75%</td></tr><tr><td>Player Health Regen</td><td>115%</td><td>100% (4 pt/sec}</td><td>85%</td></tr><tr><td>Player Health Regen Delay</td><td>75%</td><td>100% (6.5s)</td><td>115%</td></tr><tr><td>Energy Regen</td><td>150%</td><td>100% (1 pt/sec)</td><td>75%</td></tr><tr><td>Energy Regen Delay</td><td>75%</td><td>100% (10)</td><td>125%</td></tr><tr><td>Enemy Accuracy</td><td>60%</td><td>100%(Per Enemy)</td><td>125%</td></tr><tr><td>Enemy Health</td><td>75%</td><td>100% (Per Enemy)</td><td>125%</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>The Missing Link DLC</h2><p style="">The Missing Link is the name of the DLC Eidos Montreal released October 18, 2011, for PC, PS3 and Xbox 360. The Missing Link takes place between two of the later chapters in the main game. <a href="../../adam-jensen/94-8675/" rel="nofollow">Jensen</a> is on a lead, and the only way to follow it is to get into a stasis pod which is to be shipped over seas by a <a href="../../belltower-associates/92-7223/" rel="nofollow">Belltower</a> carrier. While in the stasis pod, taking him to the whatever location the ship might be headed, he is discovered by <a href="../../belltower-associates/92-7223/" rel="nofollow">Belltower</a> guards and taken prisoner. He is placed in a EMP generated chair which strips him of all his augments. This gives the player the opportunity to re-spec all of Jensen's augments as the story in The Missing Link rages on. Jensen's main goal in this DLC is trying to make his escape of the ship and at the same time trying to shed some light to some on the mysterious operation that is being run on said ship, with Belltower Associates at the head of this operation. What Jensen learns is something that could bring the once honorable <a href="../../belltower-associates/92-7223/" rel="nofollow">Belltower Associates</a> to the ground if it was ever exposed.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p style="">Human Revolution's soundtrack was composed by <a href="../../michael-mccann/72-100898/" rel="nofollow">Michael McCann</a>. The game's audio director, <a href="../../steve-szczepkowski/72-74395/" rel="nofollow">Steve Szczepkowski</a>, suggested a few artists and sources to keep in mind while composing the score: <a href="http://www.screened.com/vangelis/14-5392/" rel="nofollow">Vangelis</a>, <a href="../../trent-reznor/72-89568/" rel="nofollow">Trent Reznor</a>, <a href="../../john-carpenter/72-27465/" rel="nofollow">John Carpenter</a>, along with the first Deus Ex. McCann <a href="http://blog.us.playstation.com/2011/04/21/composing-deus-ex-human-revolution-conspiracy-transhumanism-and-synthesizers/" rel="nofollow">cited</a> the game's post-humanist themes and the constant struggle between natural &amp; technological as his primary inspiration. The duality is represented with acoustic and electronic instrumentation, with heavy use of synth to counter weight the acoustic elements.</p><h3>Tracklist</h3><p style="">The Augmented Edition soundtrack contains the following 12 tracks:</p><ol><li>Icarus (Main Theme) 3:44</li><li>Opening Credits 2:13</li><li>Main Menu 1:50</li><li>Barret Boss Fight 2:48</li><li>Detroid City Ambient 2:02</li><li>And Away We Go 1:17</li><li>Lower Heng Sha Ambient 2:16</li><li>Return to Heng Sha 2:26</li><li>Hong Hua Brothel 1:55</li><li>Everybody Lies 4:41</li><li>LIMB Clinic 1:41</li><li>Endings 2:10</li></ol><h2>References</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1868032-2011_08_23_00030.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1868032" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.56222547584187" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1868032-2011_08_23_00030.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1868032"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3661/1868032-2011_08_23_00030.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3661/1868032-2011_08_23_00030.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Final Fantasy XXVII poster in Frank Pritchard's office</figcaption></figure><p style=""><i>Human Revolution</i> contains many pop-culture and game references</p><ul><li><a href="../../final-fantasy/62-194/" rel="nofollow">Final Fantasy</a> - A Final Fantasy XXVII poster can be found in Pritchard's office/Tech Lab</li><li><a href="../../robocop/62-393/" rel="nofollow">RoboCop</a> - Two cops can be found talking about an 80s sci-fi flick set in Detroit, where a police officer is turned into a cyborg after a horrible accident (a plot device used in both RoboCop and Human Revolution).

Jason’s wife Alceme is killed on their wedding day and he vows to find the Golden Fleece on the island of Colchis in order to bring her back to life. Jason begins his journey aboard the Argo and is joined by the Argonauts (Achilles, Atalanta, Hercules, and Pan).</p><h2>Gods</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Rather than using a standard <a href="/games/?sort=release_date&amp;filter_type=genre&amp;filter_value=5/">RPG</a> <a href="/experience-points/3015-39/" data-ref-id="3015-39">experience system</a>, Rise of the Argonauts uses a deed system to level up the characters. Each action and deed you perform in the game can be dedicated to one of four Gods. These Gods then grant Jason skills and abilities.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The four Gods are <a href="/apollo/3005-7286/" data-ref-id="3005-7286">Apollo</a>, <a href="/ares/3005-1098/" data-ref-id="3005-1098">Ares</a>, <a href="/athena/3005-1145/" data-ref-id="3005-1145">Athena</a>, and <a href="/hermes/3005-7188/" data-ref-id="3005-7188">Hermes</a>. Ares (War) favours an aggressive, intimidating approach to conversation and grants skills with the mace and group tactics. Hermes (Messenger) favours a sarcastic or quick-witted approach to conversation and grants skills with the sword and dodging. Athena (Wisdom) favours a level-headed, just approach to conversation and grants skills with the spear. Apollo (Sun) favours a benevolent, compassionate approach to conversation and grants skills with the shield and personal defence.</p><h2>Combat</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Combat revolves around getting the killing blow. Jason must <a href="/disarm/3015-2972/" data-ref-id="3015-2972">disarm the opponent</a>, or disintegrate his <a href="/shield/3055-87/" data-ref-id="3055-87">shield</a>, which then leaves him/her defenseless where there by Jason can kill him. The combat is quite fluent and involves you <a href="/cover-system/3015-55/" data-ref-id="3015-55">taking cover</a> behind your shield and not attacking until the opportunity arises. You can use three weapons, the <a href="/spear/3055-573/" data-ref-id="3055-573">spear</a>, which is precise and tactical, the <a href="/sword/3055-1/" data-ref-id="3055-1">sword</a>, which is fast and furious, and the <a href="/mace/3055-724/" data-ref-id="3055-724">mace</a> which is slow but powerful. Each weapon has an alternate power attack which can be used for devastating effect.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>21365</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/1/14036/838670-rise_cover.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14036/838670-rise_cover.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/1/14036/838670-rise_cover.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14036/838670-rise_cover.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/14036/838670-rise_cover.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/14036/838670-rise_cover.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/1/14036/838670-rise_cover.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Rise of the Argonauts]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>7</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-16/]]></api_detail_url><id>16</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: M]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-12/]]></api_detail_url><id>12</id><name><![CDATA[OFLC: MA15+]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-17/]]></api_detail_url><id>17</id><name><![CDATA[BBFC: 18]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2008-12-16 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/rise-of-the-argonauts/3030-21365/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[Madden NFL 2008]]></aliases><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21413/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-07-24 21:41:31</date_added><date_last_updated>2015-05-29 23:44:59</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[Madden NFL 08 is the 19th installment in the Madden franchise.

One team defends GA-KO within their base and the other team seeks to bring it to their goal area. There is no respawning in this mode, so the team that kills all the enemy team's members automatically wins.</p><p style=""><b>Base Mission</b></p><p style="">Structured around capturing and defending small areas scattered across the map. A team wins by seizing all the bases, or by having captured more bases than the enemy team when time runs out.</p><p style=""><b>Sneaking Mission</b></p><p style="">Follows the rules of Team Deathmatch, but also introduces Snake, and with 11 or more players participating, Metal Gear Mk. II. The player controlling Snake wins if he acquires three dog tags from other players within the time limit. Each team can also claim victory by killing Snake a set amount of times, or by having scored more opposing team kills when time runs out.</p><p style=""><u>Team Sneaking Mission</u></p><p style="">Demands from the sneaking team (equipped with stealth camouflage) to bring KEROTAN and / or GA-KO to their goal area, while the other team defends the items. A team also claims victory by stunning or killing all enemy team members.</p><h2>Sons of the Patriots System (SOP System)</h2><p style="">As you learn in Metal Gear Solid 4, every soldier that fights has <a href="/">nanomachines</a>. These nanomachines allow you to suppress pain, and also link up with teammates for better communication at teamwork. This system which allows this is called the Sons of the Patriots system (SOP). By pressing the Triangle button on your controller, you will either salute or wave to teammates, depending if you are running or not. This salute/wave will enable you and everyone around you at the time to link up data with each other. Then, every person that teammate is linked up to is now linked up with you. Teammates gets an either orange/red glow, or blue glow depending on if you're playing on the red or blue side. SOP is helpful for spotting teammates who are also in danger, as a little notification with an icon will come up indicating where the teammate is, and what trouble they are having. This is a great system for enabling better teamwork and communication.</p><h2>Skill System</h2><p style="">In Metal Gear Online, a user is allowed to use specific skills (up to 3 slots) which they can level up by using them more often. Every skill has 3 levels, each level taking up one slot (not applicable for non-lethal skills such as "SIXTH SENSE" where even though they have 3 levels, only one slot is needed). These skills greatly improve efficiency in gameplay mechanics, such as shooting more accurately and reloading faster with an assault rifle, performing different kinds of <a data-ref-id="3015-865" href="/cqccqb/3015-865/">Close-Quarter-Combat</a> (CQC) moves, and spotting out traps such as Playboy magazines and <a data-ref-id="3055-1272" href="/claymore/3055-1272/">claymores</a> before falling for them.</p><p style="">Here is the full list of current skills in Metal Gear Online:</p><ol><li><b>HANDGUN -</b> <i>Skill wielding handguns.

Users can use these points as currency in order to buy things such as equipment they can put on their characters in order to give them a new look.</p><h2>Different Views</h2><p style="">Metal Gear Online, like Metal Gear Solid 4, allows you to play in both first and third-person mode. You can earn skills to enhance your first-person experience, such as gaining more zoom. First-person is only encouraged to be used when trying to make precision shots, but not as being used for every situation, as you will find yourself at a big disadvantage. The third-person shooting view can be accessed by pressing L1, where from there, you can change from left to right by pressing R3. While in third-person view, you can press the Triangle button on the DualShock 3/SIXAXIS controller to enter first-person view.</p><h2>Playable Metal Gear Solid 4 Characters</h2><p style="">Currently, there are eight Metal Gear Solid 4 characters you can play as in this game. Meryl and Johnny are only playable if the Metal Gear Online GENE Expansion is purchased, Mei Ling and Ocelot are playable if the MEME expansion is purchased, Vamp and Raiden are playable if the SCENE expansion is purchased, while Old Snake and Metal Gear Mk. II are playable via the "Sneaking Mission" game mode.</p><p style=""><b>Old Snake</b></p><p style="">Title: Legendary Hero. Available in Sneaking Mode and in all modes after Scene Expansion.</p><p style="">Snake is able to use his <a data-ref-id="3055-771" href="/octocamo/3055-771/">Octocamo</a> and Facecamo to help him blend into the surroundings. He has a CQC slam that can knockout a player instantly along with the ability to reverse CQC. In Sneaking mode he has a camo index. The closer it is to 100, the harder he is to see. He is invisible to the player if he is at 100%. His special salute is smoking a <a data-ref-id="3055-311" href="/cigarette/3055-311/">cigarette</a>.</p><p style=""><b>Metal Gear Mk. II</b></p><p style="">Title: Invisible Buddy. Available in Sneaking Mode Only</p><p style="">Mk II is controlled by <a data-ref-id="3005-150" href="/otacon/3005-150/">Otacon</a> and is on Snake's team in Sneaking Mode. It has the ability to turn invisible using <a data-ref-id="3055-846" href="/stealth-camouflage/3055-846/">stealth camouflage</a> by pressing X. Mk II will stay invisible unless it attacks. Mk II has two different weapons. The Manipulator is a taser-like tentacle used to stun players instantly. The Mk II can also use the Display Magazine, which displays a pinup on the screen. Making enemies infatuated with it like they would be with a Magazine. After an enemy is stunned, Mk II has the ability to take their dogtag and bring it to Snake. It salutes normally with it's manipulator.</p><p style=""><b>Meryl</b></p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/85465/1339138-product_04_05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1339138" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.56216216216216" data-width="370" style="width: 370px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/85465/1339138-product_04_05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1339138"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/85465/1339138-product_04_05.jpg"></a><figcaption>aka Fiery Leader</figcaption></figure><p style="">Title: Fiery Leader. Available with the Gene Expansion</p><p style="">Meryl is equipped with the <a data-ref-id="3055-90" href="/desert-eagle/3055-90/">Desert Eagle (Long Barrel)</a>, this gun has the longest Auto-Aim range in the game. She is the only one who can use it, and it costs 1000 DP. She has the ability to revive teammates instantly (equivalent to the skill Quick Recovery 3). She also has a balaclava and a scanning plug. The third hit of her PPK combo is a roundhouse, and her special salute is standing with her hand on her hip. She also has the ability to perform directional hand gestures by holding L1 and using the dpad. If she kills Akiba, she will scream his name.</p><p style=""><b>Johnny (Akiba)</b></p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/85465/1339139-product_04_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1339139" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.56216216216216" data-width="370" style="width: 370px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/85465/1339139-product_04_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1339139"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/85465/1339139-product_04_06.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/85465/1339139-product_04_06.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>aka Trap Otaku</figcaption></figure><p style="">Title: Trap Otaku. Available with the Gene Expansion.</p><p style="">Johnny has no nanomachines, so all SOP related skills are useless for allies and enemies. However, he still has a friendly fire lock, he will cower and yell "It wasn't my fault!." He is unable to move during this. He is equipped with the <a data-ref-id="3055-1323" href="/xm8/3055-1323/">XM8</a> compact, which costs 1000 DP. It has the same stats as the XM8, but only costs 1000 DP, compared to the 3500 necessary for the XM8. He also has the M82A2 .50 caliber <a data-ref-id="3055-67" href="/sniper-rifle/3055-67/">rifle</a>, it costs 10000 DP, but is a one hit kill if it hits. No matter what. Like in the story mode, Akiba is able to disarm traps by pressing triangle when near a trap, it then turns into a box that can be picked up. Also like in the story mode, Johnny is able to soil himself. If you get three kills in a row, he will end up ducking down crapping his pants, he is immobile during this. It causes a stink trail to be left behind him, which causes the same effects as a smoke grenade. His special salute is him kneeling and shouting "Ta-da!" Like with Meryl, if he kills her, he will scream her name.</p><p style=""><b>Liquid Ocelot</b></p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/85465/1339142-product_meme_05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1339142" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.56216216216216" data-width="370" style="width: 370px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/85465/1339142-product_meme_05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1339142"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/85465/1339142-product_meme_05.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/85465/1339142-product_meme_05.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>aka Guns of the Patriots</figcaption></figure><p style="">Title: Guns of the Patriots. Available with the Meme Expansion</p><p style="">Ocelot brings his special Guns of the Patriots with him to multiplayer, this is a primary weapon and costs no DP. If he fires at someone, it will lock up their SOP. This will stop them from firing their weapons, and if he uses its alternate function, he can destabilize enemies, they will crouch down and convulse for over 20 seconds. The downside to this is that Ocelot stays in his pose for about five seconds. He also has his Thor .45, a devastating handgun that only has one bullet in the chamber, but can knock an enemy over like a shotgun. Like Snake, he has maxed out weapon skills, and a one hit knockout slam and can reverse CQC. But unlike Snake, he has a strong punch combo, and can replace the last hit with a <a data-ref-id="3015-3215" href="/headbutt/3015-3215/">headbutt</a> that does more damage. He has a special <a data-ref-id="3015-498" href="/taunting/3015-498/">taunt</a>, he can run backwards mockingly like at the end of Act IV in the story mode.</p><p style=""><b>Mei Ling</b></p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/85465/1339145-product_meme_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1339145" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.56216216216216" data-width="370" style="width: 370px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/85465/1339145-product_meme_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1339145"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/85465/1339145-product_meme_06.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/85465/1339145-product_meme_06.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>aka Remote Captain</figcaption></figure><p style="">Title: Remote Captain. Available with the Meme Expansion</p><p style=""><a data-ref-id="3005-4903" href="/mei-ling/3005-4903/">Mei Ling's</a> main weapon is the Missouri, the <a data-ref-id="3055-1252" href="/battleship/3055-1252/">battleship</a>. She is able to call a remote artillery strike that can hit anywhere in the map (even underground and indoors). This kills an enemy instantly and has a large blast radius. She also has a Soliton Sonar gun that allows her to see enemies through walls and reveal the locations to your teammates. Her salute has a special effect, it has magazine like capabilities, causing enemies to be distracted and unable to move. Besides the Missouri cannons, she is not able to use lethal weapons, even if they are found on the map. She has no CQC ability, but can scan unconscious enemies.</p><p style=""><b>Raiden</b></p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/85465/1339149-product_scene_05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1339149" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.56216216216216" data-width="370" style="width: 370px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/85465/1339149-product_scene_05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1339149"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/85465/1339149-product_scene_05.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/85465/1339149-product_scene_05.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>aka White-Blooded Scout</figcaption></figure><p style="">Title: White-Blooded Scout. Available with the Scene Expansion.</p><p style="">Raiden is only able to use one gun, the Mk23 handgun. But instead he gets to use his High Frequency blade and throwing knifes. He has one of the fastest running speeds in the game, and his sword is an instant kill. Along with that, he can deflect bullets with his sword as he runs, requiring an enemy to either aim for his feet or wait for him to put his sword down. He is also able to stun enemies with the dull side of the blade. He can also jump on ledges that take two normal players to reach. He is able to use his visor to see traps. And like Johnny, he has no nanomachines, so SOP skills have no effect. Along with that, he can also fall from any distance without taking damage as long as you can survive the fall.</p><p style=""><b>Vamp</b></p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/85465/1339154-product_scene_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1339154" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.56216216216216" data-width="370" style="width: 370px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/85465/1339154-product_scene_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1339154"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/85465/1339154-product_scene_06.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/85465/1339154-product_scene_06.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>aka Undead Blade</figcaption></figure><p style="">Title: Undead Blade. Available with the Scene Expansion.</p><p style="">Vamp is very similar to Raiden, he has throwing knifes, an extremely fast running speed, jump to high ledges, and can fall from high distances. But unlike Raiden, his main weapon is a Combat Knife, which allows a one hit kill, but also has a longer combo. He can slit throats, and has sideways dashes that dodge bullets. Vamp's specialty is the ability to <a data-ref-id="3015-989" href="/respawn/3015-989/">respawn</a> right where he dies. This does not happen in Base mode. This allows him to take advantage of being in an enemies spawn or taking a target. He has brief invincibility while reviving.</p><h2>Konami ID Service</h2><p style="">Metal Gear Online is the first game in the <a data-ref-id="3045-35" href="/playstation-3/3045-35/">Playstation 3</a> not to use the <a data-ref-id="3015-2623" href="/playstation-network/3015-2623/">Playstation Network</a> service, and actually requires you to create a seperate ID in order to play. The creation of the ID is free, but one console is limited to one character, unless they are willing to pay $6.99. Through Konami's service, add-ons can be purchased via the "MGO Shop" instead of the PLAYSTATION Store.</p><h2>Game Finding Systems</h2><p style="">Metal Gear Online employs both a Matchmaking system and a Lobby system.</p><h3>Matchmaking System</h3><p style="">The Matchmaking system works just like other Matchmaking systems do, by finding a game with people near your skill level, and as time passes, the gap widens as to the diversity of users you can play with.</p><h3>Lobby System</h3><p style="">Along with the Matchmaking system, a Lobby system can also be found in Metal Gear Online. This system lets you enter different kinds of lobbies, such as the "OTACON" lobby, the "ROSEMARY" lobby, and level specific lobbies such as "VAMP: Beginner".

The game is published by Gundam license holder <a href="/namco-bandai-games-inc/3010-382/" data-ref-id="3010-382">Namco Bandai</a>. Originally released for the <a href="/playstation-3/3045-35/" data-ref-id="3045-35">PS3</a> in Japan, the game was ported to the <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/" data-ref-id="3045-20">Xbox 360</a> for release alongside the PS3 version in North America. The Xbox 360 version was later released in Japan as Gundam Musou International. The game was ported a second time in 2008 and released on the <a href="/playstation-2/3045-19/" data-ref-id="3045-19">PS2</a> in Japan under the name Gundam Musou Special.</p><p style="">As a spin-off, many of the basic concepts of its parent series are present, as the game focuses on pitting the player against hundreds of enemies to cut down while achieving mission objectives and fighting bosses, but with some Gundam-themed twists, such as allowing pilots and mobile suits to level up independently of one another.</p><h2>Plot &amp; Characters</h2><h3>Official Mode</h3><p style="">Official Mode features characters taken from the first three Gundam television series, <em>Mobile Suit Gundam</em>, <em>Z Gundam</em>, and <em>ZZ Gundam</em>, and recounts major battles that took place during the Gundam Universal Century timeline. Only six playable characters are available in this mode. The protagonists <a href="/amuro-ray/3005-4152/" data-ref-id="3005-4152">Amuro Ray</a>, <a href="/kamille-bidan/3005-4040/" data-ref-id="3005-4040">Kamille Bidan</a>, and <a href="/judau-ashta/3005-4038/" data-ref-id="3005-4038">Judau Ashta</a> are available from the start, while the characters <a href="/char-aznable/3005-4072/" data-ref-id="3005-4072">Char Aznable</a>, <a href="/paptimus-scirocco/3005-4132/" data-ref-id="3005-4132">Paptimus Scirocco</a>, and <a href="/haman-khan/3005-4019/" data-ref-id="3005-4019">Haman Karn</a> must be unlocked.</p><h3><span>Original Mode</span></h3><p style="">An original crossover storyline that features all of the playable characters from Official Mode and a select few characters from non-Universal Century universe Gundam series. Some characters that appeared in Official Mode as NPCs are also playable. The plot concerns the characters divided into factions as they investigate a mysterious planet that has appeared and is on a collision course with Earth. When their conflicts are brought to an end, <a href="/musha-gundam/3005-4165/" data-ref-id="3005-4165">Musha Gundam</a> is awakened and the pilots must stop it before it uses the planet to destroy Earth.</p><p style="">Playable characters found only in Original Mode include <a href="/loran-cehack/3005-4042/" data-ref-id="3005-4042">Loran Cehack</a>, <a href="/domon-kasshu/3005-4050/" data-ref-id="3005-4050">Domon Kasshu</a>, <a href="/master-asia/3005-4005/" data-ref-id="3005-4005">Master Asia</a>, <a href="/heero-yuy/3005-4048/" data-ref-id="3005-4048">Heero Yuy</a>, <a href="/milliardo-peacecraft/3005-4074/" data-ref-id="3005-4074">Milliardo Peacecraft</a>, <a href="/reccoa-londe/3005-4284/" data-ref-id="3005-4284">Reccoa Londe</a>, <a href="/elpeo-puru/3005-4163/" data-ref-id="3005-4163">Elpeo Puru</a>, <a href="/emma-sheen/3005-4300/" data-ref-id="3005-4300">Emma Sheen</a>, <a href="/jerid-messa/3005-4077/" data-ref-id="3005-4077">Jerid Messa</a>, <a href="/roux-louka/3005-4307/" data-ref-id="3005-4307">Roux Louka</a>, Puru Two, and Musha Gundam (Mobile suit only, a character must be selected first).</p><p style="">When a character's story mode is completed, the player unlocks the ability to pair that character with any available mobile suit outside of his or her "proper" mobile suit.</p><h2><span>Gameplay</span></h2><p style="">In both Official and Original Modes, the game begins with the player selecting a character, and then a mobile suit to pilot. When beginning the game, each pilot can only use the mobile suit normally associated with them, though completing their story modes will allow them to use any mobile suit that has been unlocked. Stats are based on a combination of the pilot's abilities and the suit's capabilities, and both pilot and mobile suit can be customized using pilot skills and mobile suit parts.</p><p style="">In battle, the primary goal is to achieve victory by claiming field position in order to complete mission objectives. Each battlefield contains a number of zones that are under a particular faction's control. By defeating enough enemies within an enemy controlled zone and then defeating an officer, the zone will come under the player's control. Upon completing the primary objective, the stage ends, the results are tallied, and the story advances to the next battle.</p><h3><span>Multiplayer</span></h3><p style="">Dynasty Warriors: Gundam has a limited number of offline multiplayer modes. These include:</p><ul><li><span><strong>Normal Match:</strong> A standard 1-on-1 battle between opponents without the use of customized suits or characters.</span></li><li><span><strong>Warriors Match:</strong> A two-part battle between two players. The first part involves fighting CPU opponents to earn upgrades and power-ups. The second part of the battle features the two players fighting each other with powered up suits.</span></li><li><span><strong>Shotdown Contest:</strong> Both players are in separate fields and must fight to keep the number of AI enemies in their zones under 50. Collecting power-ups increases the number of enemies in the opponent's field. The match ends when a player has more than 50 enemies in his/her field.</span></li><li><span><strong>Co-Op:</strong> Two players can team up and play through any stage in the standard single-player modes.</span></li></ul><h2>Gallery Mode</h2><p style="">In Gallery mode, the player can view the various things they have collected.</p><ul><li>Character Gallery: An encyclopedia in which the player view portraits and biographies of all playable characters and NPCs in the game.</li></ul><ul><li>Mobile Suit Gallery: Allows the player to view the 3D models of all playable and non-playable mobile suits as well as the mobile fortresses.</li><li>Music Player: While browsing Gallery Mode, the player can select and play any music track in the game.</li><li>Voice Gallery: Contains a listing of all in-game spoken dialogue. The player can search by individual character and select a specific quote to hear it voiced.</li><li>Player Record: Contains a count of the player's total playtime, total number of units shot down, and the number of missions played. The usage statistics of individual characters can be browsed in the Pilot Record, which lists each pilot's number of missions played, enemies shot down, the character's current level and the unique skills they possess. A separate Pilot Ranking page displays the top five pilots by the number of missions played and number of enemies shot down.</li></ul><h2>Xbox 360 Game Installation</h2><p style="">Dynasty Warriors: Gundam requires 5.6GB of space to install on an Xbox 360 HDD.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>21424</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/1820021-box_dwg.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/1820021-box_dwg.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/1820021-box_dwg.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/1820021-box_dwg.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/1820021-box_dwg.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1820021-box_dwg.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/1820021-box_dwg.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Dynasty Warriors: Gundam]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>3</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-1/]]></api_detail_url><id>1</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: T]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-25/]]></api_detail_url><id>25</id><name><![CDATA[CERO: A]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-36/]]></api_detail_url><id>36</id><name><![CDATA[PEGI: 12+]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2007-08-28 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-19/]]></api_detail_url><id>19</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 2]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-2/3045-19/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS2]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/dynasty-warriors-gundam/3030-21424/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[White Knight Story

The story features Leonard, a protagonist who can transform into the White Knight with the use of an ancient technology. The game also allows players to join forces over the internal multiplayer mode, Geonet.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Battle System <br/></h2>Battles happen in seamless transitions with no loading screens and the action happens in the map you are exploring. No random battles will be present. The gameplay at first seems remarkably similar to Final Fantasy XII's, but employs self programmable combos and team assists. These combos rely on Action Chips which are built up by performing basic attacks or receiving damage. Any attack aside from divine and elemental magic can be built into these combos, but since each has an associated Action Chip cost one cannot simply place all of their attacks into one combo.  After enough Action Chips are accrued, certain plot-specific characters will be able to turn into a very large Knight that towers over the battlefield. When not in a narrow space, transformation can be activated; while mostly used to expedite boss battles, transformations can be used on weaker enemies as well.<br/><h2>Story <br/></h2>The story begins in a fantasy kingdom called Balandor,  where the citizens were prepared to celebrated Princess Cisna's 18th birthday. Along with the occasion, the king decides to make progress towards peace with Faria, the kingdom which murdered his wife. The party was a joyful moment, consisting of a ball, nighttime celebrations and a traveling circus. Leonard, a worker for the local wine merchant, delivers wine to the castle with his friend Yulie and he decides to sneak into the festivities unnoticed. <br/><br/>Eventually Cisna is kidnapped by an evil organization called the Magi, who successfully murder her father and the ambassador of Faria to cause chaos more chaos amongst the two warring nations.  Leonard grabs Cisna and are ushered into the sewers by a mysterious man named Eldore. In the sewers, Leonard and Cisna stumble across an enormous, ancient suit of magical armor, a powerful weapon known as the White Knight. Leonard gains the ability to take control of the White Knight and goes on a journey to save the princess from the Magi. The Magi are lead by Dragias, who has the ability to turn into the Black Knight, which possesses powers comparable to the White Knight's.<br/><h2>Characters </h2><h3>Leonard</h3>The main character, the adopted son of a wine merchant, who gains the ability to transform into the White Knight.  <br/><br/><h3>Cisna </h3>Princess of Balandor who took a vow of silence after witnessing her mother's death. On the occasion of her 18th birthday, she broke her silence after witnessing her father's death at the hands of the Black Knight.<br/><br/><h3>Cyrus</h3>Leader of the castle guard who harbors a deep hatred for the Kingdom of Faria. During his childhood, he was commended for retrieving the queen's stolen necklace and was made a vassal and honorary son of the king. From that day forth, he swore to protect Balandor at any cost. After the king's death, he leaves Balandor on a journey to Faria. At the game's conclusion, he has not reached Faria nor are his intentions made clear. He is voiced by <a data-ref-id="3040-80008" href="/nolan-north/3040-80008/" slug="nolan-north">     Nolan North</a>. <br/><br/><h3>Yulie</h3>A girl who comes from the same village as Leonard. Accompanies Leonard on his journey after the incident in the Balandor. While she is aware of Leonard's infatuation with Princess Cisna, several plot points hint at a deep affection she has for Leonard (which he dismisses). Screenshots of the game's sequel hint at her potential to become a pactmaker like Leonard or Caesar, but nothing is confirmed at the time of this article's writing.<br/><br/><h3>Eldore </h3>An old aged warrior later confirmed to come from the Dogma Age, an ancient time when the five Knights were unsealed.  <br/><br/><h3>Kara</h3>A dancer from the desert city of Albana who was commissioned to assassinate Leonard upon his arrival. After she was resuscitated by Leonard, she joins the group in hopes of getting her sister back from the Magi. However, the Belcitane sacrifices her sister to form a Gigas and Kara situates herself in the group on a quest for vengeance. Later confirmed to General Dragias and the Black Knight's pactmaker. <br/><br/><h3>Caesar</h3>A feckless boy from the Free City of Greede who has a peculiar connection with dragons. After accompanying Leonard, he shortly gains the ability to transform into the Dragon Knight. <br/><br/><h3>White Knight</h3>A seven-meter-tall magical weapon from a time where such devices almost destroyed mankind. <br/><br/><h3>Black Knight</h3>An evil counterpart to the White Knight in abilities and attributes.<br/><br/><h3>Balcitane</h3>A stout, quizzical villain who directly serves General Dragias. He is voiced by <a data-ref-id="3040-93798" href="/dana-snyder/3040-93798/" slug="dana-snyder">       Dana Snyder</a>. <br/><br/><h2>Multiplayer </h2>White Knight Chronicles will feature 4 player co-op play. It will use gestures and text chat to communicate with your party. White Knight features a character creator in which the player will be able to change hairstyle, facial hair, skin color, etc. The quests from the single player game are different from the multiplayer quests but the single player will tie into the multiplayer and vice versa. The character designed by the player is the protagonist of the multiplayer mode, but he or she also appears in the singleplayer campaign, as a supporting character in Leonard's party. Changes made to the character transfer back and forth, so if the player learns a new ability or levels up while playing multiplayer, their custom character will have that ability or another level the next time they load their singleplayer game. <br/> <br/>The overall multiplayer lobby for White Knight Chronicles is called Geonet. Players will be able to create and customize towns called Georamas that are connected to Geonet. Other players can come and visit your Georama and are encouraged to, as there are rare items that are only available in the player-created Georamas. Georamas can be upgraded up to ten levels, with each gradation sporting expanded territory. However, to limit rapid growth, expansion relies on large fees paid in Guilder (the game's currency) and a high guild ranking. Downloadable items are available for purchase directly in the game, ranging in price from .99 to 5.99 USD; the cheapest items being purely decorative whilst the most expensive being alternate settings.<br/><h2>Sales <br/></h2>According to Famitsu White Knight Chronicles sold 203,000 copies sold in its first three days. White Knight Chronicles debuted number one on the Famitsu charts 12/1-12/28. According to Famitsu, after three weeks, White Knight Chronicles has sold about 300,000. <br/><h2>Localization </h2>Localization on White Knight Chronicles was finished in early 2009 but not released until a year later in February 2010; the process was also done under the employ of localization studio, 8-4 Ltd.  <a data-ref-id="3040-93798" href="/dana-snyder/3040-93798/" slug="dana-snyder">                 Dana Snyder</a> said that his character's original Japanese voice-over was deep and menacing while his interpretation was high pitched and sneering. The head of localization said that his voice was exactly what they were looking for which surprised Snyder.]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>21458</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/1832936-box_wkc.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/1832936-box_wkc.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/1832936-box_wkc.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/1832936-box_wkc.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/1832936-box_wkc.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1832936-box_wkc.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/1832936-box_wkc.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[White Knight Chronicles: International Edition]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>7</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-33/]]></api_detail_url><id>33</id><name><![CDATA[CERO: B]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-1/]]></api_detail_url><id>1</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: T]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-2/]]></api_detail_url><id>2</id><name><![CDATA[PEGI: 16+]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2010-02-02 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/white-knight-chronicles-international-edition/3030-21458/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[TC4, ]]></aliases><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21468/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-07-25 12:31:37</date_added><date_last_updated>2011-07-04 17:28:47</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[Time Crisis 4 is the fourth installment of the arcade, on-rail, light-gun shooter series developed by Namco.

before.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2>The game features the addition of a dunk contest and three point shootout while polishing the controls to be the most realistic basketball sim on the market.  It allows instant replay during the game (with the ability to save replays), several game modes ranging from street games to managing a basketball association, downloadable roster updates via the 2k lobby, online play, and player creation.<br/><br/> <h3>Game Modes</h3>NBA 2K8 features several game modes to choose from:<br/> <ul class="plain-list"> <li><b>Association<br/></b>In Association mode, you are given the ability to manage a team through several seasons.  Players are given personality types that influence things like contract negotiations and performance.  Players are also given roles such as 6th man to define their position on the team and it allows these players to tailor their abilities to fit that role.  Managers can make trades to other teams, post players that they would like to trade on the trading block, and simulate games that they don't wish to play.  Player stats increase and decrease throughout the season based on each player's performance.<br/> </li><li><b>Season<br/></b>In season mode, you select a team to manage for one season.  Managers don't have to worry about things like player roles and personality types in this mode and just play/simulate each game.<br/> </li><li><b>Exhibition<br/></b>A single basketball game where you are allowed to pick one team and play against the computer, against a friend, or against someone online.  You are allowed to set your lineup at the start of the game.<br/> </li><li><b>Street<br/></b>In street mode you may play a game of street basketball with the number of players ranging from 1-on-1 to 5-on-5.  Street mode is similar to an exhibition games with no real rules such as fouls and free throws.  Players are allowed to set the number of points to play up to and choose from the entire roster of players for members of their team.<br/> </li><li><b>Dunk Contest<br/></b>The dunk contest is a new addition to the 2K franchise.  You choose a player from the nba roster (only players with an acceptable dunk rating are selectable), and play against 3 other participants (which may be a combination of computer and local players).  The contest takes place over the course of two rounds.  Each round allows each participant to perform two dunks, and they are awarded points based on performance, uniqueness, and difficulty.  The two participants with the most points after the first round advance to the second round where the scores are reset, and the final round is played to determine the winner.  Dunks are performed via the right analog stick, and objects can also be placed around the hoop to dunk over.<br/> </li><li><b>Three Point Shootout<br/></b>The three point shootout is a new addition to the 2K franchise.  You choose a player from the nba roster and participate against other players in a shootout.  The shootout follows the format used during the NBA all-star weekend.  Players start at one rack of 5 balls on the three point line.  Each basket is worth 1 point except the final ball of each rack is worth 2 points.  Players are given a time limit and must advance to the next rack whenever a rack has been emptied until they deplete the final rack or time runs out.  The right analog stick is used for shooting each shot.<br/> </li><li><b>Tournaments<br/></b>Players can participate in online tournaments where the player chooses a team and plays against other players in an elimination tournament with a customizable number of rounds.<br/> </li><li><b>Leagues<br/></b>Players can join or invite friends to participate in an online league.  An online league is similar to the Season mode taken online.  Players are pitted against other players in the league and are generally given a set amount of time to set-up and each match.<br/></li></ul><br/> <h2>Soundtrack</h2><br/>The NBA 2K8 soundtrack has a roster that is made up of some of the most respected hip-hop artist in industry. J Dilla headlined the soundtrack for the game. Other artist on the soundtrack included Madlib, MED, Q-Tip, Percce P,  Quasimoto, J-Rocc, and Talib Kweli. The soundtrack does not just feature hip-hop, some prominent funk and rock artist are featured. Along with Drum and Bass artist A Called Gerald. <br/><br/>Peanut Butter Wolf released an album entitled Peanut Butter Wolf Presents 2K8: B-Ball Zombie War on his Stones Throw recorded label that has tracks from the game soundtrack along with unreleased and new material.<br/><br/>A full list of songs that appear in NBA 2K8<br/><b><br/>Artist - Song</b><br/>J Dilla feat.

A release date has not been officially announced, the game was set to release Christmas 2009 but failed to meet that date. A publisher has yet to be announced as well, so things are subject to change.<br/></p> <p style="">The Outsider takes place in and around a living, crowded city based on present day Washington DC. The player takes control of a CIA operative and as such gets access to an arsenal of technology, combat talents and weaponry. Something which may prove useful as he, in the game's opening scenario, gets wrongfully accused and ends up as the Public Enemy Number One in the eyes of the media and the public at large. This leaves many different ways to proceed: to wreak ultra-violent revenge, to turn the tables and exploit the shady organisations he is mixed up with for his own ends or crusading to clear his name.  </p> <p style="">The main feature of The Outsider is how it moves away from the storytelling format prevalent in most games. Its ambition is to weave the story into the gameplay by simulating the characters' aims and motivations, which will give players the freedom to form their own story by interacting with and manipulating these characters. The idea is to give each player his own truly unique experience, which he himself is responsible for.  </p> <p style="">David Braben, founder of Frontier Developments, talks about potential practical implications:<br/><br/></p><blockquote><p style="">“With this new approach all the characters exist in the game from the start, and their future actions are not pre-determined - their involvement can be pre-empted by the player, making for some interesting gameplay mechanics second-guessing what is going on, and novel replay value. If you're a contrary gamer like me, who is always wanting to go down the side route, to shoot the character giving the long speech-to-camera, to do the unexpected, then this is the only way forward.“</p></blockquote>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>21487</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/0/3441/198589-outsiderjpg.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3441/198589-outsiderjpg.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/0/3441/198589-outsiderjpg.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3441/198589-outsiderjpg.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/3441/198589-outsiderjpg.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3441/198589-outsiderjpg.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/0/3441/198589-outsiderjpg.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[The Outsider]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating/><original_release_date/><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/the-outsider/3030-21487/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[LA Noir

Noire is a detective thriller developed by Team Bondi in Australia and published by Rockstar Games.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">L.A. Noire is an action-adventure open world game developed by <a href="/team-bondi/3010-6487/" data-ref-id="3010-6487">Team Bondi</a> and published by <a href="/rockstar-games/3010-1194/" data-ref-id="3010-1194">Rockstar Games</a>. It was released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in May, 2011, and PC in November, 2011, following a development period of more than 6 years.</p><p style="">The game centers on the character of <a href="/cole-phelps/3005-15112/" data-ref-id="3005-15112">Cole Phelps</a> as he rises through the ranks of the LAPD, solving cases and arresting criminals. The game features an open world rendition of 1947 Los Angeles and uses motion scan technology to produce facial models on the game characters capable of expressing nuanced realistic emotions.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">The gameplay is more or less described as an adventure game, rather than the usual Rockstar open world killfest. In this sense, it's more like Bully--still free roaming but with a stronger set of rules over the player. While searching for clues and interrogating,occasional gunplay sequences crop up. Unlike most games, the player's health is not displayed by an HUD. Instead, when the player takes damage, the game screen fades into a black and white tone. The player <a href="/regenerating-health/3015-83/" data-ref-id="3015-83">recovers health</a> by taking cover and waiting a few seconds.</p><p style="">The first mission revealed to the press was called "The Driver's Seat". It involved the police finding an abandoned car that had its interior covered in blood. In order to carry out the investigation, the player must find clues. Unlike other games, clues don't just pop up on the HUD, but it is up to the player to search for them. Different people can find different clues, a detail that changes the way the investigation plays out. This will also affect the length of certain investigations.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/1635307-la_noire_screenshot_ps3_131.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1635307" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/1635307-la_noire_screenshot_ps3_131.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1635307"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/30036/1635307-la_noire_screenshot_ps3_131.jpg"></a><figcaption>Discovering clues is an important gameplay element in L.A. Noire</figcaption></figure><p style="">Like your cellphone in GTA 4, the player always carries around a little notebook. Each clue, testimony and anything related to the investigation is added to the detective's little book. It will also serve as a way to display the current objectives and, like in Uncharted 2, players are able to flip through it in order to pull out viable information during testimonies, for example.</p><p style="">During cases the player will always start off at a crime scene. There, the player must find clues and interview victims. Most clues usually lead up to the next event in the case. Some clues can further progress the case's finish. One major clue can change the outcome of the case.</p><p style="">As the player progresses through the ranks, they earn "intuition points". With this they have the option to, remove an answer, show all clues, and "ask the community" (online connection required). The "show all clues" option usually can help by highlighting evidence at a crime scene. The "remove an answer" option removes wrong answers to give more chances at succeeding in interviewing a person.</p><h2>Crime Desks</h2><p style="">As the character progresses through the game, Phelps will be assigned to new desks and partners.</p><ul><li><b>Patrol:</b> The Patrol desk is a department of the LAPD concerned with monitoring assigned areas in Los Angeles. Phelps starts off as a police officer in this department as a "beat cop". Phelps is partnered with <a href="/ralph-dunn/3005-18418/" data-ref-id="3005-18418">Ralph Dunn</a> at the Patrol Desk.</li><li><b>Traffic:</b> The Traffic desk is a department of the LAPD concerned with hit-and-run, felony driving, car burglaries, and car thefts. "The Fallen Idol" is one case that hits the traffic desk. This is also where Phelps is partnered with <a href="/stefan-bekowsky/3005-17369/" data-ref-id="3005-17369">Stefan Bekowsky</a>.</li><li><b>Homicide:</b> The homicide desk is one of the most brutal and harrowing desks within the game, dealing with homicide. "The Silk Stocking Murder" is one of the cases at the homicide desk. <a href="/rusty-galloway/3005-18267/" data-ref-id="3005-18267">Rusty Galloway</a> is Phelps' homicide partner.</li><li><b>Vice:</b> The Vice desk is a department of the LAPD concerned with offenses involving prostitution, drugs, lewdness, lasciviousness, and other related obscenities. Phelps is partnered with <a href="/roy-earle/3005-17370/" data-ref-id="3005-17370">Roy Earle</a> at the vice desk.</li><li><b>Arson:</b> The Arson desk is a department of the LAPD concerned with maliciously, voluntarily, and willfully setting fire to another's property, or of the act of burning one's own property for an improper purpose, such as to collect the insurance. Phelps is partnered with <a href="/herschell-biggs/3005-17800/" data-ref-id="3005-17800">Herschell Biggs</a> at the arson desk.</li></ul><h2>Story</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p style="">In a departure from previous Rockstar games, the main protagonist of L.A. Noire is righteous, and regularly finds himself in conflict with others who are less inclined to follow the rules. Cole Phelps is an honest detective, out to solve crimes and let the law do what it does best -- prosecute the offenders. In spite of that, he's not perfect. He has his failings, like any man, and it is they that drive him to try to hold himself and the world around him to the highest possible standard.</p><p style="">Cole doesn't start the game as a successful detective. His beginnings lie in the role of a street cop working the beat, responding to everyday crimes whenever they happen. The more he works, though, the more opportunities he has to hone his investigative skills and impress his superiors, earning him progressively nicer desks back at Police HQ. With each promotion comes new responsibilities in new areas of police expertise, taking him from traffic all the way through arson. Each change in desk also brings a new partner, some of who are more trustworthy than others.</p><h3>Setting</h3><p style="">L.A. Noire is set in 1947 Los Angeles and draws heavily from both plot and aesthetic elements of film noir--stylistic films from the 1940s and 1950s that shared similar visual styles and themes including crime, sex, and moral ambiguity, and were often shot in black and white with harsh, low-key lighting. The game uses a distinctive coloring-style that pays homage to the visual style of film noir. A post-war setting is the backdrop for plot elements that reference the detective films of the '40s, such as political corruption and drugs, with a classic jazz soundtrack.</p><p style="">Ninety percent of Los Angeles' buildings and signage are recreated in the game, with design and typography choices hearkening back to the advertising of the time period. Additionally, even the jingles playing on the car radios are authentic to that time, advertising products and offering public service messages one would have heard while listening to the radio during the 40's.</p><h2>Cases</h2><h3>Patrol Desk</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118913/1798953-374px_phelps_as_a_beat_cop.png" data-ref-id="1300-1798953" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.0347593582888" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:103.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118913/1798953-374px_phelps_as_a_beat_cop.png" data-ref-id="1300-1798953"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118913/1798953-374px_phelps_as_a_beat_cop.png"></a><figcaption>Cole Phelps, before he becomes a detective.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Cole Phelps starts out as a beat cop, working the streets after being awarded the Silver Star during the second World War. This part of the game serves as a tutorial, teaching players about the game's different mechanics.</p><p style=""><b>Buyer Beware</b></p><p style="">A shooting happens in broad daylight in front of a shoe store, and Phelps takes the Case. The victim is Everett Gage, the owner of the shoe shop. After interrogating one of the clerks, <a href="/clovis-galletta/3005-18900/" data-ref-id="3005-18900">Clovis Galletta</a>, it is revealed that a man by the name of <a href="/edgar-kalou/3005-18886/" data-ref-id="3005-18886">Edgar Kalou</a> may be behind it. After a short chase sequence, Phelps catches Kalou and proceeds to interrogate him. It is revealed that Galletta was about to buy something at Kalou's jewelry store before Gage sent her back to work. That Gage had just ruined his sale paired with Gage's reputation for being anti-jewish, Kalou murdered him in cold blood. It is implied that Kalou is sentenced to the gas chamber.</p><p style="">Impressed by Cole's skills, <a href="/james-donnelly/3005-17798/" data-ref-id="3005-17798">James Donnelly</a>, captain of the homicide division, promotes Phelps to the traffic division.</p><h3>Traffic Desk</h3><p style="">Promoted to Traffic, Phelps is paired with <a href="/stefan-bekowsky/3005-17369/" data-ref-id="3005-17369">Stefan Bekowsky</a>.</p><p style=""><b>The Driver's Seat</b></p><p style="">The case begins with an abandoned, blood-filled vehicle found in a train yard. After some research, Phelps discovers that the car is owned by one <a href="/adrian-black/3005-17801/" data-ref-id="3005-17801">Adrian Black</a>. His research also yields a bloody pipe and a receipt for a live hog. Phelps and Bekowsky go and visit the owner's wife, Margaret Black. There the two officers discover that the couple have a miserable marriage and that Mr. Black is having an affair. It's also made clear at this point that the bloodied pipe actually came from the house. The two detectives then go to interrogate Frank Morgan, the man who sold the hog to Black. Here players learn that Adrian Black is not dead, but instead faked his own death by covering his car in swine blood with plans to flee town. Phelps catches Black before he can leave town, and jails him for wasting police resources.</p><p style=""><b>Consul's Car (PS3 Exclusive)</b></p><p style="">Phelps and Bekowsky must investigate on the disappearance of L.A.'s consul of Argentina's car.</p><p style=""><b>A Marriage Made in Heaven</b></p><p style="">A hit and run is reported at Ray's Cafe. A married man, Lester Pattison, is found dead after being hit by a car. After snooping around, Phelps finds a an insurance letter inside the man's coat and a bloodied knife in a garbage can. He also learns that Lester and his wife, Lorna, were having an argument just before the accident. The detectives visit <a href="/lorna-pattison/3005-25987/" data-ref-id="3005-25987">Lorna Pattison</a> who seems unfazed with the news of her husband's death. Phelps eventually hunts down the driver who killed Lester who reveals that Lester was already dead before the car hit him. The morgue confirms that Lester's cause of death was from knife wounds. Phelps goes back to the Pattison residence and deduces that Lorna killed her husband with another man, Leroy Sabo, so the two could get the insurance and start a joint business venture. Sabo kills Lorna after she spills the beans, but is either arrested or killed by Phelps.</p><p style=""><b>A Slip of the Tongue (DLC)</b></p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11986/1834758-a_slip_of_the_tongue.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1834758" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.294" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:129.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11986/1834758-a_slip_of_the_tongue.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1834758"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11986/1834758-a_slip_of_the_tongue.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11986/1834758-a_slip_of_the_tongue.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>One of the pre-order DLC cases (also available for separate purchase)</figcaption></figure><p style="">A stolen car is spotted and Phelps and Bekowsky are sent to intercept it. After a short car chase, the detectives manage to stop the car, owned by a young man named Cliff Harrison. He assures the police that he legally bought the car at a used car dealership and produces the pink slip to prove it, but fled because of drugs stored in the glove compartment. Phelps investigates the used car dealership where he finds out that the car was sold by a woman named Jean Archer, and that the pink slips were made by the Marquee Printing Company. The car sold by Jean was also registered to an empty lot. A man named Belasco is arrested for grand theft auto and it becomes clear that he and Jean belong to the same car smuggling ring. Phelps later finds and arrests Jean who was trying to scam the smuggling ring by selling the cars. She tells the detectives where the cars are stored and after a shoot out, they find and interrogate the chief of the warehouse who reveals that Marquee Printing Company is behind the smuggling ring. Due to the fact that the company's boss, Levitol, is neck deep in gambling debts, he started to sell pink slips to the mafia for profit. He is later arrested for fraud.</p><p style=""><b>The Fallen Idol</b></p><p style="">The case opens with a car being driven over a cliff. The two passengers, B-movie actress June Ballard and 15 year old Jessica Hamilton, survive the crash. June tells the detectives she thinks that movie producer Mark Bishop is behind the murder attempt since he didn't want to cast her in his new movie. Jessica also points at Bishop as the culprit, but she adds an accusation of rape to June's attempted murder allegation. Phelps goes to the Hamilton residence only to find it ransacked, the wife explaining that she does not know the whereabouts of her husband. The detectives go to prop set where they discover that Bishop is running an underground pornographic network. Before they can learn more, Roy Earle from Ad Vice intervenes, saying that the owner of the prop shop is in fact an informant. Phelps isn't the only one looking for Bishop, but so is the local mafia. Bishop is finally found on the set for a movie titled "Intolerance" and after a shoot out with the mob, he's arrested for rape.</p><p style="">Due to Phelps' successes, he is promoted to homicide.</p><h3>Homicide Desk</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/119970/1784723-204.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1784723" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/119970/1784723-204.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1784723"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/119970/1784723-204.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/119970/1784723-204.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>A grisly murder scene.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The cases on the homicide desk share the same theme, centering around a single serial killer who focuses on drunk women. In the process of murdering his victims, the killer also strips them of their clothes and leaves weird writings on their bodies. Nicknamed the "Werewolf", this killer is based on a real life serial killer who terrorized L.A. in the late 40's. He was also commonly referred to as the Dahlia killer.</p><p style="">Phelps investigates the murder of 4 women during the cases "The Red Lipstick Murder", "The Golden Butterfly", "The Silk Stocking Murder", "The White Shoe Slaying" and "The Studio Secretary Murder". Each time the victims are women who were having conflictual relationships with their husbands, and were murdered late at night while drunk. Because the murder weapon is always found, Phelps always convicts someone. He is pushed by Donnelly to convict communists and child molesters to grab headlines, while the evidence usually points more towards the husbands of the victims. It is worth noting that enough evidence exists for a conviction to go either way.</p><p style="">The murder mystery ends with the case called "The Quarter Moon Murders". The killer, to show his power and cunning, as well as test both the mental and physical skills of Detective Phelps, leads him through L.A. with poems and personal items that belong to each of his victims. He leaves these things in dangerous, difficult to reach places in famous Los Angeles landmarks, such as the Hall of records and the Westlake Tar Pits. The case ends in the Christ Crown of Thorns church, where it's revealed that a bartender, who worked at different jobs through a temp agency and had been interviewed briefly by Phelps earlier in the investigation, is in fact the murderer. He studied each of the victims before murdering them, a process that allowed him to pin the crime on someone else. The killer is shot dead by Phelps but Donnelly arrives and tells Phelps that the public can not know who the real killer was as the killer was the son of an important politician running for election.</p><p style="">At the personal request of vice detective <a href="/roy-earle/3005-17370/" data-ref-id="3005-17370">Roy Earle</a>, Phelps is moved off the homicide desk to administrative vice where he becomes Earle's partner.</p><h3>Vice Cases</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/119970/1780813-launchtrailer_la_earle.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1780813" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.44954766875435" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:45.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/119970/1780813-launchtrailer_la_earle.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1780813"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/119970/1780813-launchtrailer_la_earle.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/119970/1780813-launchtrailer_la_earle.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Another investigation.</figcaption></figure><p style=""><b>The Black Caesar</b></p><p style="">Two junkies are found dead after taking army surplus morphine and seemed to have been engaged in illegal rackets. Phelps tracks the morphine back to a popcorn stand just outside the Hotel and gets into a small chase when the owner decides to make a run for it rather than answer some questions. After a short interrogation the stand owner fingers his supplier as Jermaine Jones a talent agent. In addition to giving up his supplier when put under a bit more pressure he also mentions the owner of the racketeering business as a slick fellow by the name of Merlon. Phelps and Roy visit the talent agency and find out Jermaine Jones buys his morphine from Merlon Otis who runs an illegal betting operation for a Jewish mobster by the name of Finkelstein. They also find out that Ramez Removals has close links to Vinny the Fink and clues Phelps onto another line of investigation. Next they visit Merlon Otis who also makes a run for it and has to be to chased down before they can interrogate him. Otis says that he moves the dope that Jose Ramez brings around who in turn gets the dope from the mob. The next stop is Ramez Removals where the detectives pick up some clues leading them to an ice company. The ice company in turn is just a front for the local mob, and is run by Mickey Coen's brother in law, Finkelstein. Phelps kills all the mobsters and finds the stash of army surplus morphine that was stolen off the navy ship in the beginning of the year, putting an end to the illegal morphine distribution.</p><p style=""><b>The Set-Up</b></p><p style="">Boxer Albert Hammond wins a match that he was originally supposed to lose. He quickly takes flight, and Phelps must try to find him before the mob guns him down. Through some detective work at Hammonds hotel Phelps makes a connection between the boxer and a <a href="/candy-edwards/3005-18451/" data-ref-id="3005-18451">Candy Edwards</a> with whom he had been having relations. Upon visiting the girl the two detectives find her in an altercation with an Italian gangster that Phelps knocks out in a fist fight. A quick sweep of the room reveals travel tickets, a packed suitcase and a list of possible bookies found in the jacket of the unconscious goon, along with a nasty looking knife. The duo question Candy, but as she proves uncooperative they decide to tail her instead hoping she'll lead them to Hammond. It's revealed that Candy visits all the bookies in town and cleans them out. She is the one who planned on Hammond throwing the match, and bet the other way. After tailing Candy to a bus station Cole observes her from afar while Roy suggests he had seen Hammond and goes after him. Shortly after she walks into the station bathroom a gunshot is heard . Quickly arriving at the scene Candy is found bleeding profusely from a chest wound and shortly after dies - an open window suggesting the way of the killers getaway. The two suspect that Hammond got greedy and used his girl as a baglady then killed her to collect all the winnings for himself. While heading towards the last clue pointing to Hammonds location, the coroner radios Cole to let him know that Candy died as a result of a knife wound, making the pistol found at the scene hers and pointing out the killer as a certain Italian goon with a knack for beating women and carrying switchblades. After a quick gun fight with the Italian mob intent on killing Hammond and making off with all the money themselves the detectives confronts Albert who explains his past in the military and how his honor, the last thing he had left, wouldn't let him lose. Having experienced a similar situation himself in the past, Phelps understands how important second chances are to a man and decides to let him go, ending the case.</p><p style=""><b>The Naked City (DLC)</b></p><p style="">Phelps and Earle must investigate the death of Julia Randall, a beautiful model who appears to have overdosed on morphine. However, the bruises all over her body lend a suspicion of murder, and despite being single she wears a suspicious looking ring on her hand. After learning that Randall was on medication, Phelps and Earle pay a visit to her physician, a Dr. Stoneman who at first lies about her prescription, then reveals that Julia was one of the self-destructive types who tried to live life fast and make a name for herself in the City of Angels. The detectives then visit a tailor where Julia did modeling. Heather Swanson, one of the employees at the shop reveals that Julia was modeling for her fiancee, Henry Arnett. After interrogating Henry, it's revealed that Julia was both having an affair with Henry, and she was murdered. Phelps decides to tail Henry and finds out that he's trying to pawn contraband and leave for New Mexico. The contraband used to belong to Mrs Evestrom, who is also Heather Swanson's mother. Her things were robbed from her home while she was at Dr Stoneman's party. Phelps senses that something is wrong and goes to Arnett's apartment just in time to see a man who goes by "Willy" first beat up Arnett and then escape. Arnett spills the beans, explaining that he, Julia, Stoneman and Willy were all part of a robbery ring. The doctor would organize parties while the 3 others would rob the guests' homes. However, Julia wanted out, leading Arnett and Willy to murdering her, and Willy beating up Arnett in fear that he would give him up. Arnett is arrested, Stoneman commits suicide and Willy is killed by Phelps.</p><p style=""><b>Manifest Destiny</b></p><p style="">A shooting occurs in the 111 Club where a former squadmate of Phelps who had just purchases the establishment is shot dead. Here it is revealed that the morphine is still in circulation and has started a war between the gang controlled by Mickey Cohen and a former marine unit. It's discovered that the morphine was in fact stolen from the army by a soldier named Courtney Sheldon and a group of his former squadmates from Okinawa. Through the manipulation of Dr. Harlan Fontaine, Sheldon gives up the morphine thinking Fontaine will use it to aid returned soldiers by building homes for them where they can rest after the horrors of war. However, he wound up involved with crime boss Mickey Cohen who wishes to turn a profit by watering the morphine down and selling it on the streets. Through the course of the early investigation Phelps meets and questions <a href="/elsa-lichtman/3005-17802/" data-ref-id="3005-17802">Elsa Lichtman</a> whom he becomes enamored with leading to an affair. Meanwhile Sheldon enacts the help of his former squadmates as well as that of Jack Kelso to scare off the mobsters from moving in on the morphine - which prompts the mob to put out a hit list on all the former servicemen. Phelp's former squad mates begin getting killed off by mobsters one by one and through various clues picked up along the way he's able to make a connection back to Sheldon with proof to pin the morphine heist on him. Meanwhile a man by the name of Stoker is leaking information about LA's famous madame Brenda and the services she provides for both the LAPD and high officials alike. In a secret meeting with the chief of police and district attorney among others, Roy proposes to make Phelps the sacrificial lamb for the press by airing his infidelity with the German singer Elsa Lichtman which would draw the heat away from the LAPD and other officials involved in the prostitution Brenda scandal. Just as Phelps is about to crack Sheldon and get a confession out of him he's summoned by top ranking LAPD officials and suspended for adultery, stating that a criminal cannot be an LAPD officer. The information is leaked to the journalists and his wife throws him out of the house, leaving him no other place to turn to than the source of all this trouble - the apartment of Elsa Lichtman. While awaiting a peer review Phelps is demoted to the undesirable arson desk assignment and partnered with Herchel Biggs, who much like the rest of the LAPD that has found out about his infidelity with a German woman treats him with open hostility and disregard.</p><h3>Arson Desk</h3><p style=""><b>The Gas Man</b></p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/119970/1779022-untitled_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1779022" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.4984375" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:49.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/119970/1779022-untitled_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1779022"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/119970/1779022-untitled_1.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/119970/1779022-untitled_1.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Phelps and Biggs</figcaption></figure><p style="">Phelps investigates the burning of two houses. He learns that both houses were in the way of a redevelopment fund planning to build houses for GIs. Both houses also used the same gas filters that came from Instaheat factory. While investigating at the factory, Phelps learns that Instaheat is hiring criminals and that one of the employees burned the houses by reversing the gas filters and mosquito coils. Phelps arrests Walter Clemens and Matthew Ryan. Both are anarchists and both have a criminal past. The player must choose which of the two criminals that he wants to convict.</p><p style=""><b>A Walk in Elysian Fields</b></p><p style="">Another house fire is assigned to Phelps and looks extremely familiar to the last two arsons. Like before, the house was supposed to be bought by Elysian Fields for the redevelopment fund. Phelps decides to go and investigate Elysian Fields and meets Leland Monroe, the CEO. He denies trying to chase away the final home owners by burning their houses. Meanwhile, the police department presses Cole to stop following the Elysian lead. Cole ends up killing the arsonist after an epic tram chase. However, he is unable to link the arsonist to Elysian.</p><p style="">After the case, Roy visits Phelps to tell him to stay away from Elysian. Frustrated, Phelps discovers that one of Elsa's friends died while working for Elysian on the GI redevelopment fund. Because Elsa was his beneficiary, she received a large sum of money from the insurance company. Phelps decides that Elsa should go see Jack Kelso, a private investigator working for an insurance company called California Life and Fire to discover how her friend died, and why such a big sum of money was offered to her. At this point, the player plays as Kelso.</p><p style=""><b>House of Sticks</b></p><p style="">Jack makes an investigation into the houses built by the redevelopment fund and discovers that they are constructed from bad wood found in an abandoned movie studio. Jack also discovers that many of L.A.'s top men are involved, including the mayor, Kelso's boss Curtis Benson, the chief of police, and Dr. <a href="/harlan-fontaine/3005-18995/" data-ref-id="3005-18995">Harlan Fontaine</a>.

The houses are being built out of crap wood so they can then be burned down. Thanks to an extremely high insurance rate, Elysian Fields hits the jackpot each and every time. They hand the money out to their stock owners, who just happen to be the mayor, Benson and the other top men. The redevelopment fund was financed thanks to the stolen morphine given to Dr. Fontaine by Courtney, who entrusted him with it to avoid trouble with the mob. Kelso enlists the help of Phelps and together, they plan to stop the dastardly plan and save Elsa, who's been kidnapped by Elysian's arsonist. The arsonist also also kills Dr. Fontaine.</p><p style=""><b>A Different Kind of War</b></p><p style="">Jack attempts to find the person who kidnapped Elsa. He goes to Westlake Pest Control to find the address of the kidnapper. The story then switches to Phelps' investigation on the kidnapping of Elsa, which occurred on the day before Jack's investigation. During the investigation, Phelps learns that the matchstick houses are being built along the patch of the to-be-built freeway. He realizes that the housing fraud is not about insurance, it's about eminent domain.</p><p style="">The story then switches back to Jack, as he arrives at the kidnapper's house in Rancho Rincon. Jack investigates the empty house and discovers the kidnapper-arsonist is <a href="/ira-hogeboom/3005-18994/" data-ref-id="3005-18994">Ira Hogeboom</a>, a former war buddy. Jack calls Phelps, telling him to rendevous at the LA river tunnels where Ira is hiding out. Phelps meets up with Jack en route to the tunnels, as Jack is being hunted by the police. Together they escape their pursuers, and then split up to search the tunnels for Ira and Elsa. Shortly thereafter, the assistant DA arrives, followed by the police chief who confronts him. The assistant DA threatens the chief over being potentially involved in the ballooning scandal, to which the chief offers to make a deal. The assistant DA steps in to listen.</p><p style="">Meanwhile, once caught up with Ira, Jack understands that Ira, still wearing his full combat gear, is suffering from uncontrollable flashbacks from the Battle of Okinawa. Cole then arrives and leads Elsa to safety, while Ira consents to let Jack shoot him dead to put him out of his misery. As the sewer begins to rapidly flood with torrential rainwater, the group manage to locate a manhole above them. Cole refuses to leave until he has helped everyone else climb out of the flooding tunnel, and then having no one left to lift him to safety, only looks up and says goodbye. He is then swept away by the water for good.</p><p style="">At Cole's funeral, Roy, barely able to supress his snear, gives a speech full of phony condolences and tributes to the late Cole Phelps, as though Cole were his dear friend. Unable to stand it, Elsa jumps to her feet, curses Roy, and storms out in tears and disgust. The Chief of Police, the new DA, Roy, and the other conspirators comfortably disregard her. Biggs rises to go after her, and Jack can only sit and watch.</p><p style="">After the credits end, a flashback plays depicting the fateful scene where Courney comes upon the idea of stealing the Army morphine to profit him and his unit, a group of men who otherwise have little to look forward to in civilian life. Courtney excitedly proclaims that the drug money will "give them the future they deserve". Jack is the only one among the group to reject the plot as betrayal of their honor, foreshadowing the eventual conflict that the drugs would bring, destroying nearly all of the men.</p><h2>Street Crimes - Unassigned Cases</h2><p style="">Along with the Crime Desks that are explained above, players have the option to respond to radio calls that allow them to go to crimes in progress throughout the open-world environment. Some may remember this mechanic from the <a href="/true-crime/3025-257/" data-ref-id="3025-257">True Crime</a> series. This allows players to take on extra side missions that can be completed while they are also heavily involved in the story. Each case is usually resolved within about 5 minutes and vary from shoot outs to chase sequences.</p><p style="">Unlike the story cases, players are not graded according to performance, but just have to finish the case to gain 15 XP. All the cases can be done again in free roam and the different desk assignments have different cases. There are 40 unassigned cases in all. Cases can be replayed at any point and will remain on the map with a white street crime icon; but unplayed cases appear with a red icon. After completing all street crime cases on a desk while in Free Roam mode, a message will appear saying the desk is complete.</p><h4>Traffic Desk</h4><table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Name</th><th

Noire was officially announced on September 25, 2006 by a short teaser trailer and an announcement that Rockstar would be teaming up with Team Bondi to release it. The game was originally announced as a PS3 exclusive and a second trailer for the game was released on October 5, 2006.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/315386-lanoire_teaser_thumbnail__screenshot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-315386" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.56122448979592" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/315386-lanoire_teaser_thumbnail__screenshot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-315386"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3699/315386-lanoire_teaser_thumbnail__screenshot.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3699/315386-lanoire_teaser_thumbnail__screenshot.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Early Teaser Image</figcaption></figure><p style="">The game then disappeared, its continuing existence only attested to in shareholder announcements by Take-Two, who continued to state that the game was still in development despite the fact that barely anything about the game had been revealed in nearly 4 years. The silence was finally broken by the March 2010 issue of Game Informer, which revealed that the game still existed and that it would be coming to both Xbox 360 and PS3 in late 2010. The game was then subsequently delayed and on November 11, 2010, a new trailer revealed cinematics, but no actual gameplay. A second trailer revealed that the game would be released on May 17, 2011 in the United States, while Rockstar Games' official website, announced Europe's release date to be May 20, 2011.</p><h3>Attention to Detail</h3><p style="">Team Bondi set out to develop a fully realized 1940s Los Angeles. Team Bondi used over 140 000 photos from the era to recreate certain streets and most of the important landmarks from the Chinese Theater to the Hollywoodland sign. The clothes are all era specific as well as the slang used by certain characters. In order to correctly model the clothes, clothing from the sets of King Kong and Saving Private Ryan were loaned to Team Bondi. Furthermore, the radio that plays during the game features songs from the era as well as ads that were played in the 40s. Furthermore, the cars in the game are all from the era and were modelled in game thanks to Jay Leno, who let Team Bondi into his private car collection.</p><p style="">The cases that Cole solves throughout the game are all based on real cases that happened during the 1940s and 50s around Los Angeles. The game even provides resolutions to previously unsolved cases such as the Dahlia murders.</p><h3>Motion Scan</h3><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/86760/2132904-la_noire_2010_12_17_600.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2132904" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.52" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:52.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/86760/2132904-la_noire_2010_12_17_600.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2132904"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/86760/2132904-la_noire_2010_12_17_600.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/86760/2132904-la_noire_2010_12_17_600.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Motion Scan</figcaption></figure><p style="">Team Bondi began to conduct research on motion scan technology 5 years before the game's release (which may explain why L.A. Noire was constantly delayed). The technology is said to let players see animations that traditional animation is unable to render. Motion scan focuses on rendering an extremely realistic face where cheekbones move as a character speak and eyes focus on points in the environment. Scenes were shot in two parts: first with motion capture, in order to render the body movements, and then with motion scan to render the dialogues (which was handled by sister company Depth Analysis). Shooting of the motion scan scenes was done in the "depth analysis room" where actors would wear make up in order to look like their 1940s character and recite their lines in front of cameras that were filming the front, the back and the top of their heads.</p><p style="">L.A. Noire uses motion scan during the game's lengthy interrogation sequences where players must determine if a suspect is lying or not.</p><p style="">The interrogation scenes as well as the detective scenes were handled by Team Bondi while Rockstar developed the shooting sequences.</p><h3>Working Conditions at Team Bondi</h3><p style="">In June 2011, several employees began speaking out about the allegedly horrible working conditions at Team Bondi, largely due to Brendan McNamara's poor management skills. According to the employees, they were forced to work overtime with no additional pay, and they were lied to about release dates in order to keep them working overtime. In addition, one source described McNamara as "the angriest person" he's ever met.</p><p style="">Furthermore, one source explained that management made excuses for creating new positions for the purpose of hiring new employees for less money. On paper the new positions were of less importance, but in reality they were essentially identical to the ones they supposedly fell under. The result was new hires doing the same job as those in higher positions but for less pay.</p><p style="">One source even offered an explanation as to why some critics described the game environment as "boring". According to this source, only one animator worked on gameplay during large parts of production, and Team Bondi literally had no one in their Lead Animator position from January 2008 all the way through until the final release date.</p><h2>Music</h2><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3769/2772858-l.a.+noire.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2772858" data-ratio="1" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3769/2772858-l.a.+noire.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2772858"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3769/2772858-l.a.+noire.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3769/2772858-l.a.+noire.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">The L.A.

The official soundtrack was released on May 17, 2011.</p><p style="">Recorded at Abbey Road by composer Andrew Hale, the soundtrack includes "modern takes on the classic torch songs of the period," as said by Rockstar's announcement of the soundtrack. Throughout the game itself, music helps notify players that clues are around; as they explore, players will hear more than 32 classic jazz tracks from musicians such as Billie Holiday, Dizzy Gillespie, Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, and Thelonious Monk.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Track No.</th><th>Title</th><th>Artist</th><th>Length</th></tr><tr><td>1.</td><td>"Main Theme"</td><td>Andrew Hale</td><td>3:06</td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td>"New Beginning, Pt. 1"</td><td>Andrew Hale &amp; Simon Hale</td><td>1:06</td></tr><tr><td>3.</td><td>"New Beginning, Pt. 2"</td><td>Andrew Hale &amp; Simon Hale</td><td>1:25</td></tr><tr><td>4.</td><td>"New Beginning, Pt. 3"</td><td>Andrew Hale &amp; Simon Hale</td><td>3:18</td></tr><tr><td>5.</td><td>"Minor 9th"</td><td>Andrew Hale</td><td>2:50</td></tr><tr><td>6.</td><td>"Pride of the Job, Pt. 1"</td><td>Andrew Hale &amp; Simon Hale</td><td>2:38</td></tr><tr><td>7.</td><td>"Pride of the Job, Pt. 2"</td><td>Andrew Hale &amp; Simon Hale</td><td>2:32</td></tr><tr><td>8.</td><td>"Noire Clarinet"</td><td>Andrew Hale</td><td>2:33</td></tr><tr><td>9.</td><td>"Temptation, Pt. 1"</td><td>Andrew Hale &amp; Simon Hale</td><td>1:14</td></tr><tr><td>10.</td><td>"Temptation, Pt. 2"</td><td>Andrew Hale &amp; Simon Hale</td><td>2:12</td></tr><tr><td>11.</td><td>"Temptation, Pt. 3"</td><td>Andrew Hale &amp; Simon Hale</td><td>0:52</td></tr><tr><td>12.</td><td>"J.J."</td><td>Andrew Hale &amp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly_%28band%29" rel="nofollow">Fly</a></td><td>1:30</td></tr><tr><td>13.</td><td>"Redemption, Pt. 1"</td><td>Andrew Hale &amp; Simon Hale</td><td>1:07</td></tr><tr><td>14.</td><td>"Redemption, Pt. 2"</td><td>Andrew Hale &amp; Simon Hale</td><td>2:28</td></tr><tr><td>15.</td><td>"Redemption, Pt. 3"</td><td>Andrew Hale &amp; Simon Hale</td><td>1:21</td></tr><tr><td>16.</td><td>"Slow Brood"</td><td>Andrew Hale &amp; Simon Hale</td><td>2:20</td></tr><tr><td>17.</td><td>"Use and Abuse, Pt. 1"</td><td>Andrew Hale &amp; Simon Hale</td><td>1:26</td></tr><tr><td>18.</td><td>"Use and Abuse, Pt. 2"</td><td>Andrew Hale &amp; Simon Hale</td><td>0:49</td></tr><tr><td>19.</td><td>"Use and Abuse, Pt. 3"</td><td>Andrew Hale &amp; Simon Hale</td><td>0:38</td></tr><tr><td>20.</td><td>"Use and Abuse, Pt. 4"</td><td>Andrew Hale &amp; Simon Hale</td><td>1:21</td></tr><tr><td>21.</td><td>"Fall from Grace, Pt. 1"</td><td>Andrew Hale &amp; Simon Hale</td><td>1:44</td></tr><tr><td>22.</td><td>"Fall from Grace, Pt. 2"</td><td>Andrew Hale &amp; Simon Hale</td><td>1:13</td></tr><tr><td>23.</td><td>"Murder Brood, Pt. 1"</td><td>Andrew Hale &amp; Simon Hale</td><td>2:34</td></tr><tr><td>24.</td><td>"Murder Brood, Pt. 2"</td><td>Andrew Hale &amp; Simon Hale</td><td>2:18</td></tr><tr><td>25.</td><td>"Main Theme (Redux)"</td><td>Andrew Hale</td><td>1:25</td></tr><tr><td>26.</td><td>"(I Always Kill) The Things I Love"</td><td>Claudia Brücken &amp; The Real Tuesday Weld</td><td>2:55</td></tr><tr><td>27.</td><td>"Guilty"</td><td>Claudia Brücken &amp; The Real Tuesday Weld</td><td>2:14</td></tr><tr><td>28.</td><td>"Torched Song"</td><td>Claudia Brücken &amp; The Real Tuesday Weld</td><td>4:12</td></tr><tr><td><b>Total length:</b></td><td><b>55:21</b></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>L.A.

Get people here!</figcaption></figure> A mysterious purple beam hits earth. Everyone who was outside at the time gets turned into "<a data-ref-id="3015-79" href="/zombie/3015-79/" slug="zombie">zombies</a>" but they look more like various <a data-ref-id="3015-733" href="/mutants/3015-733/" slug="mutants">mutants</a>, monsters, and bugs than actual zombies in  <i>Dawn of the Dead</i> and <a data-ref-id="3025-397" href="/resident-evil/3025-397/" slug="resident-evil">Resident Evil</a> terms. Anyway, there's tons of people who were inside buildings at the time and are now trapped by the zombies patrolling the streets outside. So you're The Last Guy, some dude with a red cape whose sole job is to run around, stand outside buildings, collect survivors into a giant line and bring them to the escape zone. In other words, IT DOESN'T MATTER and YOU SHOULDN'T CARE!<br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2> <figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1040/416209-lastguy3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-416209" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.562" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1040/416209-lastguy3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-416209"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1040/416209-lastguy3.jpg"></a><figcaption>Thermal Vision</figcaption></figure>  You use the left analog stick to move the main character around the screen and you can use the right analog stick to move the camera to look around. While running around, you can pull up thermal vision view to see which building have people in them and how many people are in there; giant blobs of green = lots of people which is very good for you. This view also comes in handy by telling you where you can go; darker areas denote boundaries. You also have a stamina bar in the lower left corner of the screen which can be used for running very fast by pressing the Triangle button or can quickly retract your line to you by pressing the Circle button. Your stamina bar will also increase as your line gets larger.<br/><br/>One of the keys to success is to try and have as long a line as possible since there are occasionally barriers on roads and paths that will only disappear if you have a certain amount of people in your line. These barriers occasionally block you from picking up one of the four VIPs hidden in each level.]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>21513</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/0/4112/211646-lastguy.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4112/211646-lastguy.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/0/4112/211646-lastguy.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4112/211646-lastguy.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/4112/211646-lastguy.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4112/211646-lastguy.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/0/4112/211646-lastguy.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[The Last Guy]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>1</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-25/]]></api_detail_url><id>25</id><name><![CDATA[CERO: A]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-29/]]></api_detail_url><id>29</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: E10+]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-18/]]></api_detail_url><id>18</id><name><![CDATA[PEGI: 7+]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2008-08-28 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-88/]]></api_detail_url><id>88</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation Network (PS3)]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-network-ps3/3045-88/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3N]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/the-last-guy/3030-21513/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[KOF XII

By modeling each character in 3D renderings and using those as a reference to draw the game's art, this has enabled SNK-Playmore to replace all previous graphical assets of the characters with high resolution hand-drawn sprites. The game is not cel-shaded and it maintains its trademark 2D gameplay.<br/> <br/> <h2>Gameplay Overview</h2> Launching in 1994 with <i><a data-ref-id="3030-4249" href="/the-king-of-fighters-94/3030-4249/" slug="the-king-of-fighters-94"> </a></i><i> </i><i>The King of Fighters '94</i> on SNK's  Neo-Geo Multiple Video System (MVS) arcade format, the series kicked off the trend of team-based fighting games. The series brought in popular characters from its other fighting game franchises such as <i><a data-ref-id="3025-188" href="/fatal-fury/3025-188/" slug="fatal-fury"> </a></i><i> </i><i>Fatal Fury</i> and <i><a data-ref-id="3025-37" href="/art-of-fighting/3025-37/" slug="art-of-fighting"> </a></i><i> </i><i>Art of Fighting</i> and mixed them with new, original characters. The <i><a data-ref-id="3025-407" href="/king-of-fighters/3025-407/" slug="king-of-fighters"> </a></i><i> </i><i>King of Fighters</i> brand of games, while played in teams of three, always features only one-on-one matches, akin to many arcade fighting games of the '90s. Each character has an assortment of kicks and punches along with throws and special moves as players attempt to deplete the opponent's health to empty. As opposed to having best-of rounds, once a player is defeated, they are taken out of the battle and victory is decided when a team's characters have been completely defeated.<br/> <br/> While the original entry did not allow "  tagging" and stuck characters in predetermined teams, <i>King of Fighters XII</i>, similar to a number of its recent predecessors, will allow real-time teammate swapping and allows players to assemble teams of three from (as of Dec. 1, 2008) 20 characters.  SNK-Playmore recently launched a full promotional Web site for the game's upcoming Japanese release and while no story lines are detailed, the site describes three new game play mechanics, which are being introduced into <i>King of Fighters XII</i>:<br/> <br/> <b>Critical Counter</b><br/> If players land a close strong punch as a counter, the player enters into a critical counter. At this point, the camera zooms in on the players and the offensive player will have a small time window to link further attacks. A dark green hit effect will signal when the time window has expired and the player can finish out the critical counter with a special technique. The moment the critical counter triggers, players can also execute a "super victory" technique, which will cause a different animation effect from ordinary moves.<br/> <br/> <b>"Killing Matches"</b><br/> If two characters simultaneous engage with a strong attack, the characters will collide with a red spark effect. From here, the players have a few options - by doing nothing, the character will automatically backstep away from the opponent. However, players can also cancel the backstep with an input to launch an attack, throw out a jumping attack or use a projectile.<br/> <br/> <b>Guard Attack</b><br/> Players are also able to use the "blow away" attacks out of a defensive position, much like in  Evoga's <i><a data-ref-id="3030-22629" href="/rage-of-the-dragons/3030-22629/" slug="rage-of-the-dragons"> </a></i><i> </i><i>Rage of the Dragons</i> for the Neo-Geo. The blue block spark will ripple and the character will execute an immediate knock-down attack that puts the opponent a full screen away.  If the input is successful, the guard attack pushes through without the opponent being able to defend it.<br/> <br/> <h2>Development</h2> It has been confirmed by the developer that The King of Fighters XII will initially launch into Japanese arcades in April 2009, with Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 home versions to follow. Ignition Entertainment will bring the game to North America and Europe some time in 2009. <br/> <h2>Home Version</h2>The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of <i>King of Fighters XII</i> will include new modes, characters, and online. The new modes include Practice Mode (similar to the previous console versions of King of Fighters), Time Trial, VS Mode, and Replay Mode which works similarly to the console iterations. Replays can be posted online as well. The online component will ship with Quick Match and Custom Match. There will be clan support and players can do member-only fights. Clan support is exclusive for PlayStation 3 owners, this is simply a BBS Forum in which players can communicate on instead of going on other online forums.  From within the clan menu, players can not only communicate but also issue challenges to other players. For Xbox 360, there's a variant on this called Team Battle. There's going to be an option to pick between English and Japanese audio tracks for the characters.<br/> <br/><h2>Characters </h2>Unlike previous King of Fighters, characters are not organized into official teams. There are also no bosses or hidden characters.<br/> <br/><ul class="plain-list"><li><a data-ref-id="3005-5601" href="/ash-crimson/3005-5601/" slug="ash-crimson">                      Ash

while trying to find out exactly what went down in this open-world first-person action game.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Dead Island is a <a href="/first-person-perspective/3015-330/" data-ref-id="3015-330">first-person</a> action RPG, set on the <a href="/island/3035-2801/" data-ref-id="3035-2801">island</a> of <a href="/banoi/3035-3863/" data-ref-id="3035-3863">Banoi</a>, a fictional tourist paradise in Papua, New Guinea, which has become the unlikely site of an outbreak of zombies. The game features an <a href="/open-world/3015-207/" data-ref-id="3015-207">open world</a> for the player to explore where they pick up <a href="/questing/3015-1422/" data-ref-id="3015-1422">quests</a> from other survivors on the island, and has an emphasis on <a href="/melee/3015-444/" data-ref-id="3015-444">melee combat</a>. It supports up to four players with drop-in drop-out cooperative multiplayer. It was originally planned for a 2008 release, but subsequently entered <a href="../../development-hell/92-1339/" rel="nofollow">development hell</a>. After various delays, it was released on the <a href="../../xbox-360/60-20/" rel="nofollow">Xbox 360</a>, <a href="../../playstation-3/60-35/" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 3</a> and <a href="../../pc/60-94/" rel="nofollow">PC</a> on September 6th 2011 to a cool reception.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Players will progress through the game by completing quests that are given by NPCs. Other than the main quest line, there are numerous <a href="../../side-quests/92-338/" rel="nofollow">side quests</a> that, while optional, will provide the player with rewards like better weapons, new weapon mods, or sometimes just good ol' cash.</p><h3>Combat</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Since the setting of the game is a civilian island, firearms &amp; ammo are scarce, so the focus is more on <a href="../../improvised-weapon/92-3091/" rel="nofollow">improvised melee weapons</a>. Players will have to do most of their zombie killing up close and personal with items they find in the environment, which ranges from pipes &amp; shovels, to machetes &amp; sledgehammers, and much more. On top of being able to slash and swing melee weapons, players can also throw any weapon for distance attacks. There is also a front kick option, which can damage and knock down enemies. Players can enter <a href="../../fury/92-4069/" rel="nofollow">Fury Mode</a>, which is a special superhuman alt-mode that goes completely unexplained and grants different bonuses and special attacks depending on which character the player is controlling.</p><h3>Stamina</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">There is a <a href="../../stamina-bar/92-3569/" rel="nofollow">stamina bar</a> that governs the actions of the player. The bar will deplete when attacking, sprinting, &amp; jumping, so players must choose their attacks carefully. If the stamina bar empties, the player cannot perform these actions until more stamina regenerates, which happens automatically when walking or standing still.</p><h3>Loot</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">As players go through the game, there is ample opportunity to collect <a href="../../loot-gathering/92-161/" rel="nofollow">loot</a> from the environment. Loot comes in many forms. Players will be able to find new weapons &amp; blueprints, health, cash, as well as miscellaneous items like wire, bleach, batteries, etc. These items can be used at benches to modify weapons for additional damage. Materials and weapons can also be purchased from <a href="../../merchants/92-806/" rel="nofollow">traders</a> that are found throughout the game.</p><h3>Benches</h3><figure style="width: 480px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/63119/2005200-deadislandbench.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2005200" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/63119/2005200-deadislandbench.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2005200"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/63119/2005200-deadislandbench.jpg"></a><figcaption>Benches can repair and modify weapons</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0"><a href="../../workbench/93-4482/" rel="nofollow">Benches</a> allow the player to do three different things to their weapons, all of which requires various amounts of cash:</p><ul><li><b>Repairing:</b> All weapons in the game wear down as they are used, and require constant repairing so they don't break. Repairing a weapon costs money, the amount of which depends on how much the weapon has worn down.</li><li><b>Upgrading:</b> All weapons can be upgraded up to three times to give them a boost to their stats.</li><li><b>Modding:</b> Players can craft mods by combining their weapons with other materials, giving the a boost to their damage (such as adding a rotary saw to a baseball bat) as well as other additional attributes (such as poison, fire, or electricity). A blueprint and the correct materials are required to craft a modded weapon.</li></ul><h2>Story</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Although the player chooses one of four playable characters to start the game, the game will unfold exactly the same with each character, in both single player and in co-op.</p><h3>Act I</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The story starts off with the player waking up alone in a hotel room, unaware that overnight the island has become overrun with zombies. As the player makes his way out of the hotel, a voice comes on over the loudspeakers, directing him to safety and away from pursuing zombies. The player then reawakens in a beach hut with survivors. After helping them fend off a zombie attack, <a href="../../john-sinamoi/94-20450/" rel="nofollow">John Sinamoi</a> informs the player that he has been in contact with someone else on a radio who promises he can help, but the signal is too weak. They need to get everyone to the main lifeguard tower where there are medical supplies and a stronger radio. After the player clears that area of zombies, the survivors relocate there, only to discover the antenna for the radio is broken.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">To repair the antenna, the player must travel to the lighthouse, where other survivors are also congregating. In order to get the antenna repaired, the player must first help the lighthouse survivors get the power turned back on. After fixing the power, fixing the antenna, and collecting food and water for the survivors, Sinamoi asks the player to retrieve a heavy truck from the hotel. After fighting through zombies at the hotel and getting the armored truck, the player takes it to <a href="../../earl/94-21084/" rel="nofollow">Earl</a>, a mechanic who can reinforce the truck turning it into a rolling fortress. Earl’s daughter, <a href="../../jin/94-20929/" rel="nofollow">Jin</a>, convinces the player to use the truck to deliver food and medicine to other survivors at Saint Christopher’s Church.</p><h3>Act II</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Once arriving at the church, the player meets Mother Helen and another band of survivors, and she informs the player that the water supply to the church is not working, and needs help turning it back on. The pump station is across town, and once the player gets there, they find it is also occupied by survivors, but this time they are hostile gang members that immediately begin firing guns at the player. After defeating these enemies, the player must turn off a series of hydrants and then battle his way through the underground sewers to cut the water flow to the canals, and open the floodgates.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Coming out the other side of the sewers leads the player to the Town Hall, where yet another band of survivors is holed up. They are low on supplies and are unwilling to help the player, so the heroes argue about the situation and believe that the mysterious voice on the radio is their only way off the island. Logan calls Jin on the walkie-talkie to come pick them up but she objects, saying that they're meant to help everyone survive, and threatens to take the armored car &amp; leave them. They reluctantly agree to help.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The player then goes to gather supplies at a nearby supermarket that has been overrun by gang members. After battling through the store, they find a large cache of food, but when the player returns to the Town Hall they find everyone dead from zombies. The heroes decide to go back to the church.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Once back at the church, Mother Helen informs them that Jin left to go help the thugs at the Police Station and asks that players go look for her and retrieve the armored car. Turns out they kidnapped her and she needs rescuing. The player fights his way back through the sewers and the police station to get Jin, and then returns to give supplies to the church survivors. The player then take the supplies and the armored truck back to Sinamoi, who tells them the antenna is still too weak to reach the voice on the radio. So the plan is to use an antenna that is on top of the hotel, in hopes that one is strong enough. Once the player reaches the hotel roof, they finally get a hold of the voice on the radio who identifies himself as <a href="../../ryder-white/94-20930/" rel="nofollow">Ryder White</a>, a colonel with the Banoi Island Defense Force. He promises they will be picked up by helicopter if they can reach him on a separate nearby island which houses a prison. But the prison is surrounded by mines, so White tells them they will need to find a smuggler named <a href="../../mowen/94-20931/" rel="nofollow">Mowen</a>, who knows the way through the mines. Using old Japanese WWII bunkers &amp; tunnels, the player travels with Jin inland into the jungle to find Mowen.</p><h3>Act III</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Once the player enters the jungle, they meet Matutero, a local who agrees to help them get to Mowen if they find and kill Afran, a gang leader who stole his boat. Once the boat is acquired, they are able to navigate the swamps and meet up with Mowen, but he claims he doesn’t know how to get to the prison. Instead he informs the player that he knows of a secret laboratory in the jungle where the zombie virus originated from, and takes them there.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Once at the laboratory, the player meets <a href="../../doctor-robert-west/94-20934/" rel="nofollow">Dr. Robert West</a> who is in charge of the lab. He claims the lab is just a cosmetic testing lab that is only in the jungle to escape animal rights activists, but other clues around the lab suggest otherwise. After helping out a few scientists in the lab, Dr. West informs the player that there are some local natives that are immune to the virus, and he needs blood samples from them to attempt a cure. Ryder White is very interested in a vaccine as well, for his wife has been bitten and he wants to save her, and he urges the player to bring some to him.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">After analyzing some blood from the natives, Dr. West believes he can create a vaccine if he has a more stable version of the virus. This requires the player to find a native who hasn’t had any contact with the virus at all, even if it is dead tissue. A tribal leader agrees to show the player to their catacombs, where they find <a href="../../yerema/94-20936/" rel="nofollow">Yerema</a>, an abused young woman. The player saves her and leads her back to the boat, where Mowen is being attacked by zombies. The player saves him too, then drops off Yerema and a sample from the catacombs at Dr. West’s lab.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Back at the boat, Mowen tells the player that he really does know the way to the prison, and will show him in appreciation for saving his life. Going back to the lab one more time, the player finds it overrun with zombies, and Yerema alive but locked in a cage. The player frees her and grabs the antidote that Dr. West made and heads back to the boat, where they depart for the prison to meet up with Ryder White in cell block C.</p><h3>Act IV</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The player successfully navigates the mine field and arrives at the prison with Yerema, Jin, and Mowen. Mowen knows some of the prisoners, and they meet up with <a href="../../titus-kabui/94-20932/" rel="nofollow">Titus</a>. Titus will show them to cell block C if the player helps him get some food and weapons, and free an inmate who is locked in solitary. Ryder contacts the player of the radio, urging him to forget about helping the prisoners and get to him as soon as possible, using the sewers. Once through the sewers, the player runs into Yerema and Jin, who inform the player that Titus and the others were overrun by zombies, and Mowen traded his boat to them so they would tell him how to find the player. But Mowen was then killed by the undead along the way.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The player enters an elevator, which is flooded with knockout gas as soon as the door closes. The characters awake later, and meet <a href="../../kevin/94-20933/" rel="nofollow">Kevin</a>, a tech-savvy prisoner who had helped them previously. Kevin reveals that Ryder White has stolen their vaccine while they were knocked out and is attempting to flee. He also says that White is going to bomb the islands once he has escaped, so they must get to White’s chopper on the roof and stop him.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The player battles his way to the roof and find White with his wife strapped to a gurney. White refuses to hand over the vaccine, so Jin releases the wife from her restraints, and she bites White. White shoots his wife &amp; Jin, and then quickly injects the vaccine. But the vaccine's formula is flawed, and White transforms into a large hulking zombie, and the player must kill him. The player escapes Banoi in White’s helicopter with Kevin and Yerema, and the game ends with Kevin giving a knowing grin suggesting he has a more sinister agenda.</p><h2>Characters</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">There are four playable characters, each representing a different specialty:</p><ul><li><a href="../../xian-mei/94-19023/" rel="nofollow">Xian Mei</a> - Bladed weapons expert, and the "Assassin" within the group. Mei pulls out a special high powered blade while in Fury mode.</li><li><a href="../../sam-b/94-19022/" rel="nofollow">Sam B</a> - Blunt weapons expert, and the "Tank" of the group. Sam puts on brass knuckles and can kill most enemies in one punch while in Fury mode.</li><li><a href="../../purna/94-19696/" rel="nofollow">Purna</a> - Firearms expert, and the "Support" within the group. Purna takes out a revolver while in Fury mode.</li><li><a href="/logan-carter/3005-19411/" data-ref-id="3005-19411">Logan Carter</a> - Although described as a throwing weapons expert, Logan is actually the "Jack of all Trades" within the group, and gets decent skill in sharp weapons, blunt weapons, <em>and </em>firearms. Logan uses infinite throwing knives while in Fury mode.</li></ul><h3>Skill Trees</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">At the beginning of the game, each character has little survival experience, and therefore limited skills. Over the course of the game, players will gain <a href="../../experience-points/92-39/" rel="nofollow">XP</a> by killing zombies and completing quests. This XP goes towards leveling up, and each time a character levels up they gain 1 point to put towards skills in their <a href="../../skill-tree/92-382/" rel="nofollow">skill tree</a>. Although each character's skill tree has the same three general branches, the specific skills within each one are mostly unique to that character:</p><ul><li><b>Fury</b> - This branch levels up Fury mode, the high damage mode the character can enter for a limited time.</li><li><b>Combat</b> - This branch levels up the offensive side of things, like increased damage, better critical chance, quicker reloads, etc.</li><li><b>Survival</b> - This branch levels up things like lockpicking, increased loot, decreasing melee damage received, increased weapon durability, etc.</li></ul><h2>Zombies</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Dead Island features a detailed damage system for the zombies. Each enemy has multiple layers to them, and will show damage depending on where the player hits them and what weapon they use. Skin can be torn, limbs will come off, and bones can be broken. For example, a baseball bat can break a zombie's arm, rendering it useless, while a machete can just cut the whole arm off. Each zombie has its own health bar, stamina bar, and level, which will scale along with the player as they level up.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">There are seven different types of zombies in the game, and each was designed with two concepts in mind: making a challenging but still fun to combat threat for the player to deal with.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Walker</strong> - These are the most common enemy in the game. They are the typical slow-moving, shuffling zombies that are classic to the genre, as seen in movies like <i>Night of the Living Dead</i>.</td><td><figure style="width: 202px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/63119/1982470-walkerzombie.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1982470" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.7326732673267" data-width="202" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:173.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/63119/1982470-walkerzombie.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1982470"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/63119/1982470-walkerzombie.jpg"></a></figure></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Infected</strong> - Similar in looks to the Walker, except they will sprint at the player when they see them, and flail their arms for multiple fast hits. They are also much quicker to get up when knocked down. These monsters were inspired by the "fast zombies" made popular by films like <i>28 Days Later</i>.</td><td><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/63119/1982471-infectedzombie.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1982471" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.0474860335196" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:104.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/63119/1982471-infectedzombie.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1982471"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/63119/1982471-infectedzombie.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/63119/1982471-infectedzombie.jpg"></noscript></a></figure></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Thug</strong> - These are very slow zombies, but stand several feet taller than Walkers or Infected, and will do <em>very</em> high damage and knock the player down if they get hit.

This additional content is essentially a <a href="../../horde/92-3021/" rel="nofollow">Horde Mode</a> that has players trying to survive increasingly difficult waves of zombies in one of four new maps, either alone or in co-op. Any loot, XP, or items earned in this mode can be brought into to the campaign. The DLC also contains a new exclusive weapon called the Brain Wave Bomb.

several Marvel characters in this follow up to the first Ultimate Alliance game.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Unveiled via press release in February 2008, the follow-up to the Marvel Ultimate Alliance was originally titled Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2: Fusion. However, after a while, the Fusion subtitle was dropped and shortened simply to Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style="">The story of Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 takes its inspiration from a couple of actual story arcs that occurred in Marvel Comics, namely <a href="http://www.comicvine.com/secret-war/39-54398/">Secret War</a> and <a href="http://www.comicvine.com/civil-war/39-40615/">Civil War</a>. Some of the details of the story arcs have been either changed or rearranged in order to work as a cohesive story in the video game.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19306/1294306-marvel_ultimate_alliance_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1294306" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.55666666666667" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:55.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19306/1294306-marvel_ultimate_alliance_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1294306"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/19306/1294306-marvel_ultimate_alliance_2.jpg"></a><figcaption>Ass-kicking in Latveria</figcaption></figure><p style="">The game starts with Captain America, Iron Man, Spider-Man, and Wolverine as the default playable characters. As the group of heroes are led by Nick Fury, they are seen in an early cutscene infiltrating Latveria in an effort to unravel a conspiracy involving Lucia Von Bardas, the new Latverian ruler. Nick Fury and the other heroes eventually discover that The Tinkerer has been developing tech for many other countries while being funded by Latveria, leading to the ideals of international super-terrorism. The President of the United States is against the idea of any attack on Latveria, as von Bardas has been making friendly ties with the U.S. Regardless of this, Nick Fury and the crew go through with their attack and lay waste to Castle Doom, which also leads to the belief that Lucia Von Bardas died in the attack. Some years later, Lucia Von Bardas ends up reappearing with cyborg-like body parts, and she ends up controlling a ship that begins to use its weaponry to wreak havoc and destruction on New York City. A group of heroes (of the player's choosing) must then fight and defeat Lucia Von Bardas. In the wake of the destruction, the world begins to question the morality and necessity of superheroes being able to unleash their own brand of justice without having any form of accountability.</p><p style="">As some time has passed, the world seems to be pulling back its paranoia a little bit after the events of Secret War, especially since Nick Fury has disappeared from the public eye and stepped away from his head position at S.H.I.E.L.D. Tony Stark (Iron Man) is seen in his penthouse watching the T.V. while worrying about fighting off a new federal bill called the Superhuman Registration Act, which would force all mutants and superheroes to register with the federal government. As he watches a reality show that has been created by the group The New Warriors, Tony and the world witness on live television as Nitro causes a massive explosion that kills hundreds to thousands of people, including an elementary school of children. This forces the hand of the federal government in passing the Superhuman Registration Act.</p><p style="">Maria Hill, the current leader of S.H.I.E.L.D., asks Captain America to meet with her. She asks him to help round up all of the superheroes and convince them to register. Captain America sees this as a violation of his freedom, and when he refuses, Hill tries to have him put down by her security. Captain America runs for a window, jumps out, and lands on a airplane that flies him away. This leads to Captain America being denounced by the President as a vigilante and criminal. In the meantime, Iron Man decides that he will try to have the act smashed before it gets to legislative hands by going to the White House and speaking in protest to the bill. However, when he and others superheroes arrive at the White House, they find out that it is under siege by Titanium Man.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19306/1294308-marvel_ultimate_alliance_2_hands_on_preview.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1294308" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.56333333333333" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19306/1294308-marvel_ultimate_alliance_2_hands_on_preview.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1294308"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/19306/1294308-marvel_ultimate_alliance_2_hands_on_preview.jpg"></a><figcaption>Which side are you on?</figcaption></figure><p style="">In the aftermatch, Iron Man and Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic) that registering might be the best thing that anyone with powers and abilities can do. Meanwhile, Captain America and Luke Cage decide that registering would be the worst possible solution for innocent people who cannot defend themselves, as well as a violation of their rights. These events form two distinct sides: Pro-Registration (led by Iron Man) and Anti-Registration (led by Captain America).</p><p style="">Pro-Reg starts hunting down any Anti-Reg mutants and superhumans, which includes the likes of Luke Cage, Wolverine, and Daredevil. Some superhero teams, such as the Fantastic Four, start seeing tensions rise between members because of the actions that each team participate in. While these hunts are occurring, the Pro-Reg side also has the likes of Hank Pym and Reed Richards working on a form of nanite that can be used to control any mutants and superhumans in case they decide to misuse their powers.</p><p style="">Eventually, Tony Stark sets up a fake hostage situation at Stark Industries as an ambush attempt to round up a large number of Anti-Regs. He offers Captain America and anyone else who joins amnesty, but a battle then ensues. During this battle, the nanites located in some of the mutants/supervillains end up having the opposite effect than expected, leading to Venom and Green Goblin attacking S.H.I.E.L.D. officers and trying to destroy the facility. Luckily for the Anti-Reg team, one of the S.H.I.E.L.D. soldiers is Nick Fury, and he asks for help in disarming the bombs. The team ends up finding out that who they thought was Nick Fury was merely one of Nick's android versions. Nick informs them that they need to break into the Negative Zone and steal a sample of the nanite formula in order to stop the continued spreading of nanites worldwide. When they find the sample, Nick hits the self-destruct mechanism to prevent any more nanites from getting out, and the team leaves him behind. At this point, the Superhuman Registration Act is suspended so the teams can unite and fight this new threat.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19306/1294310-mua2_2291.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1294310" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.55862068965517" data-width="290" style="width: 290px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:55.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19306/1294310-mua2_2291.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1294310"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/19306/1294310-mua2_2291.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/19306/1294310-mua2_2291.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Yeah, there's a block puzzle or two...</figcaption></figure><p style="">After relocating to the Black Panther's home of Wakanda, which is also a safe place from any nanite attacks, the team finds out that the nanite-controlled superhumans and mutants have formed as a collective known as The Fold. As The Fold tries to attack Wakanda, the team helps Black Panther and Storm defend the country. The team finds out that in order to stop the nanite attacks, they need to broadcast a radio signal that will disable their control over mutants and superhumans. After curing Venom and Green Goblin, the team heads to Iceland to broadcast the signal. Upon arrival, they find The Tinkerer is behind the whole ordeal, and he has taken control of Nick Fury with nanites.</p><p style="">Once Nick Fury has been beaten, the game has two possible endings. The Anti-Registration side shows the player that the Superhuman Registration Act has been appealed, while the Pro-Registration side shows the Act being repealed.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">Like its predecessor, Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 plays like a hybrid between beat 'em up and hack 'n' slash gameplay styles. At its core, the game is an RPG, featuring a leveling system and skill points for special abilities and overall character performance improvements. Players can go through the game solo with three A.I.-controlled allies, or they can play in up to four player co-op. There are also training rooms and additional "disc missions" that can be completed for additional rewards such as experience points or boosts.</p><h3>Boosts</h3><p style="">As players progress through the game, they will unlock different "boosts", which can be used as a means of enhancing a team's abilities. Examples are increased overall damage, increased health regeneration, additional currency drops, etc.</p><h3>Team Bonuses</h3><p style="">In addition to boosts, Team Bonuses return from the first Marvel Ultimate Alliance. By having four members of the same "team", you will gain an additional bonus (i.e. four characters from X-Men, the Fantastic Four, The Avengers, etc).</p><h3>Attitude</h3><p style="">Used primarily as a storytelling device, the "attitude" mechanic has been added to the conversations with NPCs. During a conversation, players can choose between Aggressive, Defensive, or Diplomatic responses in conversation, with different responses leading to acquiring different boosts for your team.</p><h3>Pro-Reg/Anti-Reg Specific Characters</h3><p style="">At a certain point in the story, the player can choose to side with Pro-Registration or Anti-Registration, which leads to changes in the story and access to exclusive characters. Iron Man, Songbird, and Mr. Fantastic are exclusive to the Pro-Reg side, and Captain America, Luke Cage and Iron Fist are exclusive to the Anti-Reg Side. There are some slight differences to the ending depending on which side you choose as well.</p><h3>Damage / Resistance Types</h3><p style="">Similar to the first Marvel Ultimate Alliance, knowing individual characters and bosses damage and resistance types is a must in order to staying alive and defeating bosses successfully. The known types of damage are broken down into three categories - physical damage, elemental damage, special damage. Within these three they are broken down even further into individual subsets.</p><h4>Special Damage:</h4><ul><li>Energy</li><li>Mental</li></ul><h4>Elemental Damage:</h4><ul><li>Cold</li><li>Fire</li><li>Electricity</li></ul><h4>Physical Damage:</h4><ul><li>Melee</li><li>Impact</li><li>Crushing</li><li>Wounding</li></ul><h3>Fusion System</h3><p style="">A big part of this game is the fusion system. Each character can combine his powers with another one to make a super powerful attack. Teaming up now becomes an essential part of the gameplay. With all of the characters being able to combine powers with one another, there will be hundreds of moves that can be used. Each move is different, some being used to clear a room quickly, some being used on only one enemy, and even the ability to revive fallen comrades. One example of these attacks is when Iron Man and Hulk combine powers, Hulk rips a hunk of rock or material from the ground, Iron Man superheats it, and then Hulk throws it at your enemies, creating an explosion.</p><h2>Confirmed Characters</h2><p style=""><u><b>On Disc Characters</b></u></p><ul><li><a data-ref-id="3005-1376" href="/captain-america/3005-1376/">Captain America</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-2574" href="/daredevil/3005-2574/">Daredevil</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-1472" href="/deadpool/3005-1472/">Deadpool</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-2379" href="/gambit/3005-2379/">Gambit</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-4803" href="/green-goblin/3005-4803/">Green Goblin</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-859" href="/the-hulk/3005-859/">Hulk</a>*</li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-2358" href="/human-torch/3005-2358/">Human Torch</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-4716" href="/iceman/3005-4716/">Iceman</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-3498" href="/invisible-woman/3005-3498/">Invisible Woman</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-8678" href="/iron-fist/3005-8678/">Iron Fist</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-1370" href="/iron-man/3005-1370/">Iron Man</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-2424" href="/jean-grey/3005-2424/">Jean Grey*</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-2385" href="/luke-cage-power-man/3005-2385/">Luke Cage</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-4176" href="/mr-fantastic/3005-4176/">Mr. Fantastic</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-5538" href="/ms-marvel/3005-5538/">Ms. Marvel</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-12150" href="/penance/3005-12150/">Penance</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-12461" href="/songbird/3005-12461/">Songbird</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-69" href="/spider-man/3005-69/">Spider-Man</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-2374" href="/storm/3005-2374/">Storm</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-2388" href="/the-thing/3005-2388/">The Thing</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-4899" href="/thor/3005-4899/">Thor*</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-932" href="/venom/3005-932/">Venom</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-10" href="/wolverine/3005-10/">Wolverine</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-4905" href="/nick-fury/3005-4905/">Nick Fury</a></li></ul><p style=""><u><b>Downloadable Content</b></u></p><ul><li><a data-ref-id="3005-2028" href="/juggernaut/3005-2028/">Juggernaut</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-3162" href="/carnage/3005-3162/">Carnage</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-4396" href="/psylocke/3005-4396/">Psylocke</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-4805" href="/cable/3005-4805/">Cable</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-3584" href="/black-panther/3005-3584/">Black Panther</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-2281" href="/magneto/3005-2281/">Magneto</a></li></ul><p style=""><u><b>Console Exclusive Characters</b></u></p><ul><li><a data-ref-id="3005-2386" href="/blade/3005-2386/">Blade</a> (Wii)</li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-2850" href="/cyclops/3005-2850/">Cyclops</a> (Wii)</li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-8678" href="/iron-fist/3005-8678/">Iron Fist</a> (360/PS3)</li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-4396" href="/psylocke/3005-4396/">Psylocke</a> (Wii)</li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-12463" href="/sentry/3005-12463/">Sentry</a> (DS)</li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-12462" href="/she-hulk/3005-12462/">She-Hulk</a> (DS)</li></ul><p style="">*To unlock these characters, you must find 5 of each character-specific collectible. For Hulk, it is the Gamma Regulator. For Thor, it is the Asgardian Rune. For Jean Grey, it is the M'kraan Fragment.</p><h2>Easter Eggs and Differences</h2><p style="">Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 features a couple of references and Easter Eggs for fans of both Marvel and the storylines it tries to portray. It also features a couple of changes made to the story, mainly Civil War, in order to make it work better as a video game.</p><p style=""><b><u>Easter Eggs</u></b></p><ul><li>Stan Lee, co-creator of several Marvel characters and former President of Marvel Comics, makes a cameo appearance in the game. He plays the role of Senator Lieber, and he is located in a parking garage at the White House sequence of the game. Stan Lee's real name is Stanley Lieber.</li><li>During some of the news cutscenes, as well as venturing around the world, the player will hear and see references made about people believing that Tony Stark and other superheroes may be Skrulls in disguise. This is a reference to <a href="http://www.comicvine.com/secret-invasion/39-47264/">Secret Invasion</a>, the storyline that follows after Civil War. Speculation has also been made that a third MUA game could focus on this story arc because of this ongoing reference in the game. However, with Activision losing the Marvel license recently, which also eliminated the DLC* on both the XBL and PSN services, it seems exceedingly unlikely.</li></ul><p style="">*On July 1 2010, the DLC was made available once again and will remain so only until Dec 31 2010.</p><p style=""><b><u>Differences</u></b></p><ul><li>In Civil War, the battle at Stark Industries plays out quite differently than it does in the game, and this is where the story for the game veers into quite a different direction. In the comics, Black Goliath is killed by a Thor clone at the battle.

mission.</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Mass Effect 2 is a third-person science-fiction action RPG developed by <a href="/bioware/3010-98/" data-ref-id="3010-98">BioWare</a> and published by <a href="/electronic-arts/3010-1/" data-ref-id="3010-1">Electronic Arts</a> for the <a href="/xbox-360/3045-20/" data-ref-id="3045-20">Xbox 360</a> and <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC</a> on January 26, 2010 (and the <a href="/playstation-3/3045-35/" data-ref-id="3045-35">PlayStation 3</a> almost a year later).</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Set two years later after the events of the original <a href="/mass-effect/3030-16909/" data-ref-id="3030-16909">Mass Effect</a>, players control <a href="/commander-shepard/3005-658/" data-ref-id="3005-658">Commander Shepard</a> as he (or she) teams up with <a href="/cerberus/3015-3233/" data-ref-id="3015-3233">Cerberus</a>, a human supremacist organization that resurrected him after his violent death from an unknown force, to investigate why human colonies are being abducted. Along the way, Shepard must assemble an elite inter-specie team from the dark, seedy underbelly of the galaxy, and prepare for what appears to be a suicide mission.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">It has similar, but significantly redesigned gameplay – such as the ability to interrupt conversations via renegade and paragon actions, a completely revamped <a href="../../inventory/92-513/" rel="nofollow">inventory</a> system, <a href="../../regenerating-health/92-83/" rel="nofollow">health regeneration</a> as opposed to requiring the use of medigel, and an improved combat system that includes facilitating cover, as well as altered class development options. Mass Effect 2 focuses much more on shooter aspects than the first installment did although the <a href="../../dialogue-trees/92-77/" rel="nofollow">dialogue trees</a> and streamlined RPG mechanics are still present. Mass Effect 2 has been positioned as the <a href="../../dark-second-act/92-3275/" rel="nofollow">dark second act</a> of the trilogy.Players once again fill the shoes of <a href="../../commander-shepard/94-658/" rel="nofollow">Commander Shepard</a>, the main protagonist from the first game and allows veteran players of the first title to import their saves allowing for a variety of decisions to carry over to Mass Effect 2. None of the gear, abilities, credits, and etc, however, will be carried over, but characters continued in this manner do get a credit, ability, and experience bonus. Due to the many gameplay changes from the first game, players are allowed to change the appearance, but not gender, and the class of Commander Shepard upon importing their save file from Mass Effect.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The PlayStation 3 version of Mass Effect 2, released on January 18, 2011, uses an enhanced graphics engine while including the Blood Dragon Armor, Kasumi: Stolen Memory, Overlord, and Lair of the Shadow Broker DLC for free. In addition, because the original Mass Effect was never released on the PlayStation 3, the game includes an interactive digital comic which retells the events of Mass Effect while allowing players to make key decisions about the story (which, in turn, applies the decisions to the player's created character). This comic, known as Mass Effect: Genesis, was later released for the Xbox 360 and PC as paid DLC. The PlayStation 3 version also has exclusive paid DLC consisting of pre-order content from the Xbox 360 and PC versions.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Combat mechanics</h3><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-size="small" data-ref-id="1300-1221371" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1221371-sfdeclazarus3.jpg" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1221371-sfdeclazarus3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1221371"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/30/1221371-sfdeclazarus3.jpg"></a><figcaption>Battling a heavy mech</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Mass Effect 2 has radical gameplay changes since the first installment; however, overall the basis of the game remains the same. Commander Shepard must acquire a team, can use this team in missions, but only two squadmates at a time, and levels up as the game progresses. The game remains a third person, cover based shooter. The most radical gameplay changes are the re-assortment of classes, weapons skills and the combat experience. Classes have been refined and there abilities have been changed to add more impact, meanwhile weapons have been assorted into groups. The radial menu to use skills remains intact, but unlike the first game, only one skill can be used at a time. In addition, a global cooldown for powers is employed rather than the individual cooldowns used in the previous game.</p><h3>Inventory</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The inventory has also been radically redefined as an inventory "menu" is almost non-existent and "loot" has been limited to money and weapons upgrades. The player chooses his load-out before a mission, and can change his armor at an armory in his/her cabin. The overall <a href="../../heads-up-display/92-180/" rel="nofollow">HUD</a> (Heads-Up Display) has also been radically changed. Health is regenerative, and enemies health/armor/shields are all shown in bars when a player's reticule hovers over them. Combat has been changed by opting out of unlimited ammo and adding ammo through the use of "heat sinks." These are standard for all of Shepard's weapons and are used throughout the galaxy being dropped by almost any dead enemy. Heavy weapons have been added as an extra weapon class to give Commander Shepard a strategic advantage when a situation goes out of control. These use Power Cells as their ammunition system, and like the heat sinks are universal in all heavy weapons. The heavy weapons range from the Arc Projector, which fires out lightning, to the M-920 Cain which causes a miniature nuclear explosion.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The overall tone of the game is also darker and grittier. While the first game had Shepard touring the Citadel and exploring the Mass Effect universe the second game is more linear. The story has multiple uses of crime gangs, mercenary groups, and warlords and takes the player through the darker part of the galaxy. This includes slums in Omega, and war-torn worlds such as the krogan homeworld of <a href="../../tuchanka/95-2702/" rel="nofollow">Tuchanka</a>.</p><h3>Dialogue Trees/ Interrupt Feature</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">In terms of dialogue, a new interrupt feature have been added where the player is given the option to interrupt a conversation by performing either a Renegade or Paragon action. Also, having the option for paragon/renegade dialogue choices is no longer managed by a skill, but instead by the overall points a player has accumulated over the course of the game, which is defined by his/her actions.</p><h3>Hammerhead (Mako's replacement)</h3><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-size="small" data-ref-id="1300-1465879" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22435/1465879-hammer.jpg" data-ratio="1.2572463768116" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:125.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22435/1465879-hammer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1465879"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22435/1465879-hammer.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22435/1465879-hammer.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The DLC Hammerhead vehicle, hoped to improve upon the Mako</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The <a href="../../m35-mako/93-250/" rel="nofollow">Mako</a> has not made a return, and instead planetary scanning has taken its place. Planetary Scanning opts out of landing on planets that look, for the most part, the same and instead the player takes control of the Normandy and scans a planet for minerals which can be used for upgrades. Instead of landing on planets to do sidequests, Shepard can partake in "N7 Missions" which offer more depth and a more varied amount of scenery. The <a href="../../m-44-hammerhead/93-4360/" rel="nofollow">Hammerhead</a> was added later through free DLC which tries to refine the Mako experience.</p><h3>Save Import</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Mass Effect 2 allows the player to use a save-import system, wherein a player can import their character from Mass Effect. This imports their character's look, and choices made in the first game which will have impact in the second game. This will effect whether certain characters appear or not, whether some quests are available, and reactions from people around the player to his/her previous actions. This tracking of choices will continue onwards to Mass Effect 3.</p><h2>Classes (Shepard)</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">New players to the game can choose from six different classes for Commander Shepard, each focusing on a different set of abilities for use in combat situations. These abilities are split into three categories:</p><ul><li><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0"><b>Combat</b> - Focused on weapon efficiency and physical fitness. Combat users primarily have the ability to use different ammo types for their weapons.</p></li><li><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0"><b>Biotic</b> - Focused on special abilities using the character's <a href="../../biotics/92-4299/" rel="nofollow">bio-amp implants</a>. Biotic users primarily have the ability to manipulate dark energy fields, which can cause direct damage and disarray to enemies.</p></li><li><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0"><b>Tech</b> - Focused on special abilities using the character's omni-tool. Tech users primarily have the ability to throw elemental attacks at enemies.</p></li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td><h3>Soldier</h3><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-size="small" data-ref-id="1300-2165221" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87790/2165221-class_soldier.png" data-ratio="1.3487903225806" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:134.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87790/2165221-class_soldier.png" data-ref-id="1300-2165221"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/2165221-class_soldier.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/2165221-class_soldier.png"></noscript></a></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Pure combat specialists who, through intense weapons training, can focus directly on their targets for lethal accuracy.

This included adding completely new weapons, such as the Heavy Weapons subset. BioWare has also released DLC packs that include more weapons. The weapons can be classified into six categories and 3-4 weapons within each subset excluding the Heavy Weapons subset which include:</p><h3>Assault Rifles</h3><ul><li><b><a href="../../m-8-avenger/93-3707/" rel="nofollow">M-8 Avenger</a>:</b> A common, versatile, military-grade assault rifle. Accurate when fired in short bursts, and deadly when fired on full auto. The Avenger is effective at penetrating shields, armor, and biotic barriers. The modular design and inexpensive components of the Avenger make it a favorite of military groups and mercenaries alike. The avenger has a reputation for being tough, reliable, easy to use, and easy to upgrade. Manufactured by the Elkoss Combine.</li></ul><ul><li><b><a href="../../m-15-vindicator/93-3694/" rel="nofollow">M-15 Vindicator</a>:</b> A battle rifle favored by assassins and elite mercenaries that fires in highly accurate five-round bursts, and effective against armor, shields, and biotic barriers, Upgrades the Avenger Assault Rifle. Manufactured by Elanus Risk Control Services for the Blue Suns mercenary group, the Vindicator is quickly gaining popularity in the Terminus Systems.</li></ul><ul><li><b><a href="../../m-76-revenant/93-3706/" rel="nofollow">M-76 Revenant</a>:</b> Unleashes a storm of deadly high-velocity slugs. Less accurate than an assault rifle, but has a high ammo capacity and deals much more damage. Effective against armor, shields, and biotic barriers. Upgrades the Vindicator Battle Rifle. This custom-made machine gun features technology not widely available. Protected against replication by sophisticated Fabrication Rights Management technology, only the richest and most powerful warlords can afford this weapon.</li></ul><ul><li><b>M-96 Mattock Heavy Rifle</b><b>:</b> Bringing a flash from the past, the Mattock is an old rifle modified to work with thermal clips. The idea of bringing the gun on the ship was of joint origin coming up from Miranda Lawson, and the ship's AI, EDI. Firing at medium range and being semi automatic, the Mattock is effective against armor, shields, and barriers. The Mattock is a semi-automatic hybrid weapon with an assault rifle's low heat production and a sniper rifle's punch. Though it does not have a sniper rifle's precision scope, marksmen favor its increased power over that of an assault rifle to bring down hardened targets, its lack of a fully automatic setting is advertised as a feature rather than a shortcoming since it curbs a soldier's tendency to spray inaccurate fire under stress. (Firepower Weapons Pack)</li></ul><ul><li><b>Geth Pulse Rifle:</b> A Geth assault rifle that is effective against shields and biotic barriers. They are rarely recovered from the battlefield, and are generally considered difficult to maintain or repair and have yet to be replicated by any organic species. Though it is comparable to the M-15 Vindicator in its effectiveness, there are two major anomalies that differentiate it from other assault rifles. First, it has a variable rate of fire due its mass effect field generation technology following a sine curve. Second, its slugs are lighter than standard M-8 Avenger slugs, but they are encased in a phasic envelope. It should be noted that this weapon is only available to the player on a Hardcore or Insanity-level play-through. It can be found on Haestrom.</li></ul><h3>Shotguns</h3><ul><li><a href="../../m-22-eviscerator/93-3695/" rel="nofollow"><b>M-22</b></a> <b><a href="../../m-22-eviscerator/93-3695/" rel="nofollow">Eviscerator Shotgun</a>:</b> A non-military civilian designed shotgun. The unique ammunition generator utilized by the Eviscerator makes it a powerful anti-armor weapon with a longer range than standard shotguns. The illegal nature of the design prevents this weapon from be distributed to military entities. This lethal close range weapon is available as part of a download including the Cerberus Assault Armor and can be acquired through the Cerberus Network.</li></ul><ul><li><b><a href="../../m-23-katana/93-3696/" rel="nofollow">M-23 Katana</a>:</b> Common military shotgun. Deadly at short range, but ineffective at long range. Very effective against shields and biotic barriers, but weak against armor. Manufactured by Ariake Technologies, the Katana is a common mercenary weapon and is also popular on colonies with varren infestations.</li></ul><ul><li><b><a href="../../m-27-scimitar/93-3697/" rel="nofollow">M-27 Scimitar</a>:</b> An elite military shotgun capable of rapid fire, this weapon is deadly at short range, but ineffective at long range. Effective against shields and biotic barriers, but weak against armor. Upgrades the Katana Shotgun. Manufactured by Ariake Technologies, the Scimitar features twin mass effect generators, giving it a more rapid rate of fire than a traditional shotgun. This weapon was created for the Eclipse mercenary band but is rapidly becoming popular with Blood Pack mercenaries, as well.</li></ul><ul><li><b><a href="../../m-300-claymore/93-3700/" rel="nofollow">M-300 Claymore</a>:</b> Very rare Krogan shotgun. Deals high damage at short range; less effective at long range. Effective against armor, shields, and biotic barriers. Upgrades the Scimitar Assault Shotgun. The Claymores is of human design but is only used by Krogan as the kickback from a single shot is enough to break a human's arm. Its large slugs are effective against armored targets. Protected by sophisticated Fabrication Rights Management technology, this weapon is nearly impossible to reproduce and its prohibitively expensive.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Geth Plasma Shotgun:</b> Coming out of one of Cerberus cell's researching the Geth. The Geth Plasma Shotgun is deadly weapon. This three-barreled Geth weapon fires miniature but potent cluster rounds of superconducting projectiles and has a longer range than standard shotguns. A two stage trigger system allows for either quick-fire capacitors or a charge-and-release attack to electrify the projectiles as they exit the weapon. As the rounds hit the target, they fragment and electricity arcs between the pieces, flash-converting the air to conductive plasma. The resulting impact, heat, and electrical charge overloads shields and barriers and causes massive trauma to unarmored targets. (Firepower Weapons Pack)</li></ul><h3>Sniper Rifles</h3><ul><li><b><a href="../../m-92-mantis/93-3703/" rel="nofollow">M-92 Mantis</a>:</b> Powerful sniper rifle able to take out most targets in a single shot. Incredibly accurate at long range, but rate of fire is slow. Effective against armor, but weaker against shields and biotic barriers. Manufactured by Devlon Industries, the Mantis is primarily used by police and planetary militia groups. The prevalence of kinetic barriers has made this weapon less popular with the military, but it is used more frequently in the Terminus system where defenses are less common.</li></ul><ul><li><b><a href="../../m-97-viper/93-3709/" rel="nofollow">M-97 Viper</a>:</b> Rapid-fire military sniper rifle. Incredibly accurate and deadly at long range, these weapons are popular amongst infiltrators and assassins. Very effective against armor; somewhat effective against shields and biotic barriers. Upgrades the Mantis Sniper Rifle. Rosenkov Materials developed this deadly weapon in response to the rising prevalence of kinetic barriers. While kinetic barriers still offer some protection from this weapon, it's sheer power and rapid rate of fire make it capable of quickly killing almost any target, regardless of its defenses.</li></ul><ul><li><b><a href="../../m-98-widow/93-3710/" rel="nofollow">M-98 Widow</a>:</b> Accurate and deadly anti-material rifle. Effective against armor, shields, and biotic barriers. Upgrades the Viper Sniper Rifle. Weighing in at 39 kilograms, the Widow Anti-Material Rifle is primarily used by sniper teams in assault missions against armored vehicles or Krogan. While kinetic barriers offer effective protection on vehicles, the kind generated by conventional military field generators are far too weak against the Widow. The Widow was never designed to be carried and fired by a human. Although this modified model can be carried, no ordinary human could fire it without shattering an arm.</li></ul><ul><li><b>M-29 Incisor:</b> The Incisor is one of a new wave of military and police sniper rifles designed to overload active defenses such as shields. Firing three shots with each pull of the trigger, the Incisor's burst is so fast that all three rounds will be in the target by the time the barrel has moved a millimeter, increasing its stopping power without sacrificing accuracy. As an added benefit, the noise of the burst is comparable to a single rifle shot in duration, making it no easier to locate the sniper by sound. (Aegis Pack or part of Digital Deluxe Edition)</li></ul><h3>Heavy Pistols</h3><ul><li><b><a href="../../m-3-predator/93-3699/" rel="nofollow">M-3 Predator</a>:</b> Reliable, accurate sidearm. Effective against armor; weak against shields and biotic barriers. Manufactured by Elanus Risk Control, the Predator is a valued as powerful, deadly, and relatively inexpensive weapon. While it is not generally deployed in the military, where kinetic barriers are common, it's still very popular in the Terminus Systems where these defenses are less common.</li></ul><ul><li><b><a href="../../m-6-carnifex/93-3701/" rel="nofollow">M-6 Carnifex Hand Cannon</a>:</b> Highly accurate and lethal sidearm. Effective against armor; weak against shields and biotic barriers. Upgrades the Predator heavy pistol. The Carnifex is a favored sidearm of mercenary leaders and Eclipse mercenary tech specialists. An expensive but powerful weapon. Its marketing materials feature a charging Krogan with the slogan "Don't you wish Carnifex was at your side?".</li></ul><ul><li><b>M-5 Phalanx Heavy Pistol:</b> Brought on the ship by Jacob Taylor, the Phalanx are rare but powerful pistols. A highly accurate and lethal sidearm. Effective against armor; weak against shields and biotic barriers. The M5 Phalanx is the product of the Alliance's Offensive Handgun Project that developed a close in weapon to be used on armored or shielded targets with no loss of stopping power in comparison to the soldier's assault rifle. The Phalanx enjoys a ballistics advantage even over most "hand cannons" and features an integral laser sight which is highly visible even in bright lighting conditions. Civilian variants are often purchased by colonists on planets that have particularly dangerous game animals. (Firepower Weapons Pack)</li></ul><h3>Submachine Guns</h3><ul><li><b><a href="../../m-4-shuriken/93-3698/" rel="nofollow">M-4 Shuriken Machine Pistol</a>:</b> A common but effective submachine gun. Fires three-round bursts, and can be pulsed for a higher rate of fire at the expense of accuracy. Very effective against shields and biotic barriers. As kinetic barriers have grown in popularity, so has the popularity of submachine guns. Manufactured by the Elkoss Combine, the Shuriken Machine Pistol has a reputation for being deadly and easy to use, but is weak against armor.</li></ul><ul><li><b><a href="../../m-9-tempest/93-3693/" rel="nofollow">M-9 Tempest Submachine Gun</a>:</b> This submachine gun fires in long deadly bursts. Very effective against shields and biotic barriers, inaccurate at long rage. Weak against armor. Upgrades the Shuriken Machine Pistol. The commonality of kinetic barriers has led to increased demand for rapid-fire weapons like the Tempest. Produced by Elanus Risk Control Services for the Eclipse mercenary band, the Tempest is an expensive but deadly addition to anyone's personal arsenal.</li></ul><ul><li><b><a href="../../m-12-locust/93-3692/" rel="nofollow">M-12 Locust</a>:</b> The Kassa Fabrications Model 12 Locust is a compact submachine gun developed for the Alliance but now favored by gang enforcers and hitmen. Very effective against shields and biotic barriers. Featuring a complex recoil-reducing mechanism and high-grade autotargeting software, the Locust is a longer-range, more accurate fire than others submachine guns. (Kasumi: Stolen Memories DLC)</li></ul><h3>Heavy Weapons</h3><ul><li><b><a href="../../m-100-grenade-launcher/93-3704/" rel="nofollow">M-100 Grenade Launcher</a>:</b> A rapid fire grenade launcher used by Vorcha mercenaries in the Blood Pack group. Single shorts are able to take out multiple targets and it is useful against armor, shields, and biotic barriers. It is the first heavy weapon that Shepard acquires.</li></ul><ul><li><b><a href="../../ml-77-missile-launcher/93-3711/" rel="nofollow">ML-77 Missile Launcher</a>:</b> A powerful missile launcher that can be easily carried by a single person due to its collapsible design. Missiles are able to distinguish between friends and enemies, locking onto enemy targets and home in on their position.</li></ul><ul><li><b><a href="../../m-622-avalanche/93-3705/" rel="nofollow">M-622 Avalanche</a>:</b> A weapon based on cryo-round technology. The cooling laser collapses it's ammunition into Bose-Einstein condensate, a mass of super-cooled subatomic particles capable of freezing enemies. It is effective against armor, shields, and biotic barriers.</li></ul><ul><li><b><a href="../../m-920-cain/93-3708/" rel="nofollow">M-920 Cain</a>:</b> Nicknamed the "Nuke Launcher," this mass effect-technology based weapon contains 25g high-explosive round slugs. By accelerating its ammo to 5km/s, the round generates an explosion matrix on impact, inflicting high damage within a large area and creating the archetypal mushroom cloud. All beings - enemies, allies, and sometimes even the user themselves - are not safe when this weapon is fired.</li></ul><ul><li><b><a href="../../collector-particle-beam/93-4061/" rel="nofollow">Collector Particle Beam</a>:</b> A highly precise and destructive radiation beam is fired at a magnitude that is several orders higher than the amount needed to launch a high-velocity projective via a mass effect field. It is effective against shields, barriers, and armor.</li></ul><ul><li><b><a href="../../m-490-blackstorm-projector/93-4055/" rel="nofollow">M-490 Blackstorm Projector</a>:</b> The ammo consists of a few particles of matter within a high-powered mass-increasing field, elevating them to near infinite mass and creating a powerful localized gravity well - a singularity. This draws in all enemies and objects towards its center before explosively hurling them away. This weapon is only accessible through pre-order DLC that was exclusive to certain retail stores.</li></ul><ul><li><b><a href="../../m-451-firestorm/93-3702/" rel="nofollow">M-451 Firestorm</a>:</b> Based on the Turian "Hieras" flamethrower, the weapon fires out an anti-personnel and anti-armor flame in a deadly stream. The Turian design used low-octane hydrocarbons thickened with dentra oil, which humans reverse engineered to create a synthetic composite with almost identical properties that could be fabricated from heavy weapon fuel cells using an omni-tool. This allows the sticky fuel to be spray onto surfaces while burning at 1,600 degrees Celsius. This weapon can only be found during Zaeed Massani's loyalty quest, which is part of the Cerberus Network DLC entitled Zaeed - The Price of Revenge.</li></ul><ul><li><b><a href="../../arc-projector/93-4060/" rel="nofollow">Arc Projector</a>:</b> Uses an invisible laser to ionize the initial target which allows it to be targeted by a powerful electrical bolt, the laser then 'paints' nearby target so that the bolt can jump from one enemy to another with little resistance. This weapon is highly effective against shields and a group of enemies. The arc projector is available as free DLC through the Cerberus Network.</li></ul><h2>Other Characters</h2><h3>Allies</h3><table><tbody><tr><td><figure style="width: 160px" data-align="right" data-size="small" data-ref-id="1300-1475076" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/1475076-160px_illusive_man_character_shot.png" data-ratio="1" data-width="160" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/1475076-160px_illusive_man_character_shot.png" data-ref-id="1300-1475076"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/31936/1475076-160px_illusive_man_character_shot.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/31936/1475076-160px_illusive_man_character_shot.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Illusive Man</figcaption></figure><a href="../../the-illusive-man/94-10097/" rel="nofollow"><b>The Illusive Man</b></a><br />The head of Cerberus and all of its operations.

Unexpectedly, the Normandy comes under attack by an unknown force in a large spaceship. Shepard orders an evacuation of the ship as they are no match for this unknown attacker but cannot escape himself, because he has to rescue Joker who refuses to abandon ship. Shepard is able to get Joker safely to an escape pod, before he is thrown into space as the Normandy is destroyed by the unknown ship. Shepard floats in space briefly, before suit damage causes his suit to depressurize. This is the apparent end for Commander Shepard, as he falls, immobile, towards the surface of a planet.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Shepard's body is then picked up by an extremist group called <a href="../../cerberus/92-3233/" rel="nofollow">Cerberus</a>, an organization created to protect and advance humanity's interests in the galaxy no matter the cost. This ideal often manifests itself with ruthless behavior which causes the group to be considered more akin to a terrorist group than as a legitimate entity, especially from within the human Alliance which regards them as a severe embarrassment to their own efforts at peaceful co-existence.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Cerberus begins work on rebuilding Shepard's body as part of an effort codenamed "The Lazarus Project". After two years of work, Shepard is rebuilt, although he is awakened before he can be fully tested physically and psychologically. When he awakes, Shepard finds himself in a lab woken up by <a href="../../miranda-lawson/94-13205/" rel="nofollow">Miranda Lawson</a> who is urging him to get up and move since the station where Project Lazarus was being conducted was attacked by mechs. Shepard is able to fight his way through the station and finds Jacob, a Cerberus operative who was serving as security chief for the station. He and Shepard make their way through the station together (much to the dismay of Shepard, still dazed and confused, and angry that he has found himself inadvertently working for Cerberus) and find Wilson, a doctor who had helped in recreating and reviving Shepard. Wilson was injured and with Shepard's help is healed enough to join them. Wilson informs them that the mechs on the station have been overridden by someone and he had tried to disarm them but was unsuccessful. This makes Jacob suspicious because Wilson should not have access to mechs since he works in medical. Wilson deflects his suspicion by blaming Miranda who he claims is conveniently missing while they are in harm's way. Jacob wants to go find Miranda but Wilson tells them to forget her and that they should just make their way to escape shuttle since there is no way she survived. They decide to go to escape but right as they open the door to the shuttle bay they find Miranda waiting there. To everyone's surprise she shoots Wilson and states that he was a traitor and that he had reprogrammed the security mechs to attack everyone. They then escape the station and Miranda takes Shepard to meet her boss, the Illusive Man.</p><figure style="width: 480px" data-align="right" data-size="medium" data-ref-id="1300-1261658" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/1261658-mass_effect_normandy_sr2.png" data-ratio="0.46875" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:46.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/1261658-mass_effect_normandy_sr2.png" data-ref-id="1300-1261658"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/30036/1261658-mass_effect_normandy_sr2.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/30036/1261658-mass_effect_normandy_sr2.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>The New Normandy</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Following his resurrection, Shepard meets with the leader of Cerberus, the mysteriously named <a href="../../the-illusive-man/94-10097/" rel="nofollow">The Illusive Man</a>. The two forge an uneasy relationship; Shepard is asked to investigate the disappearance of human colonies along the fringes of the galaxy and given the opportunity to walk away if he finds nothing. Shepard also acquires a new ship, the <a href="../../ssv-normandy-sr-2/93-3368/" rel="nofollow">Normandy SR-2</a>, which Cerberus had also constructed under extreme secrecy as well as improve upon with a number of advancements that have advanced it beyond its predecessor's original design. While it is staffed by Cerberus, Shepard discovers that the promised pilot that "he can trust" turns out to be none other than Joker who had signed on with the organization when the Alliance began to whitewash Shepard's reports on the Reapers. Using Dossiers given by the Illusive Man on "the toughest, the brightest, the deadliest allies we can find", Shepard begins assembling an elite team after discovering proof at the colony of Freedom's Progress revealing the involvement of a mysterious race known only as the <a href="../../the-collectors/92-4352/" rel="nofollow">Collectors</a>, who may or may not have an alliance with the Reapers.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">After gathering the squad and going on various Collector-based tasks assigned by the Illusive Man such as going on the Collector ship for data or a derelict Reaper for an IFF Shepard will finally go through the <a href="../../omega-4-relay/93-3365/" rel="nofollow">Omega-4 Relay</a> where player-made decisions made in the game will affect the outcome of this final mission.

The entire game focuses around ten Japanese girls and their career as famous pop idols. Their career is in the hands of the player who takes the role of the producer for the fictional 765 Production Studio, who can be kind and protective of the girls (but also a little perverted if he so desires).</p><h2>Gameplay Mechanics</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2470/415325-the_idolmaster__8_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-415325" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.537109375" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:53.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2470/415325-the_idolmaster__8_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-415325"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2470/415325-the_idolmaster__8_.jpg"></a><figcaption>An Idolmaster Performance</figcaption></figure><p style="">Each idol has different statistics, which are important for dealing with her personality or the style she will perform in. After choosing an idol to work with, the player is able to talk with the idol. The answers that are chosen can give a positive or negative effect on the attitude towards the player from the idols. After this, the game is divided by days, which in turn are divided in activities for the idol throughout the day. The first stage of every day is entirely optional, and involves sculpting the idol's image such as choosing songs to practice or changing her costume. Many types of clothes are available ranging from cute and girly, cool and sexy to cosmic and funny outfits. In addition, the player is able to accessorize the idol. The clothes and accessories the idol wears can have a major impact on her statistics, allowing her to perform better and feel more confident. After this, the idol can start her training which are a series of mini games to raise the idol's statistics.The most important part of the game are the auditions, which are composed out of another series of mini games. By performing well in the mini games, the player can improve the idol's performance and impress the judges. After the audition is completed successfully, the player is able to watch and record the entire performance.</p><h2>Music</h2><p style="">THE iDOLM@STER features many original Japanese pop tracks, each song can be sung solo or by up to three different idols. Because of the popularity of THE iDOLM@STER in Japan, several soundtrack CD's and collections have appeared on the market, such as THE iDOLM@STER Master Box, Drama CD's and a Christmas album. Each idol has its own solo album as well, featuring the idol's most favorite songs.</p><h2>PSP Versions</h2><p style="">The arcade version of the game will be ported to the PSP and released in 3 separate versions, each with their own exclusive characters. <i>Perfect Sun</i> has been fan-translated and is currently one of the few games in the series to be available in English (and the only one unofficially). Here's a list of what version contains which girls:</p><h3>The iDOLM@STER SP: Wandering Star</h3><ul><li>Yukiho Hagiwara</li><li>Iori Minase</li><li>Ami Futami</li><li>Mami Futami</li></ul><h3>The iDOLM@STER SP: Perfect Sun</h3><ul><li>Haruka Amami</li><li>Yayoi Takatsuki</li><li>Makoto Kikuchi</li></ul><h3>The iDOLM@STER SP: Missing Moon</h3><ul><li>Chihaya Kisaragi</li><li>Azusa Miura</li><li>Ritsuko Akizuki</li></ul><p style="">Other games for the PSP include the Shiny Festa games, which had been released in English on April 22nd, 2013 (although with different titles) on iTunes.

Drive the Nazis out of Paris through whatever means necessary as Irish mechanic-turned-race-car-driver-turned-soldier-of-fortune Sean Devlin.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The Saboteur is a third person sandbox game set in the lively streets and rooftops of 1940s Paris, at the height of the Nazi occupation. You play as <a href="../../sean-devlin/94-6127/" rel="nofollow">Sean Devlin</a>: drinker, driver, and womanizer. After seeking revenge for being cheated from a win, Sean finds himself looking for revenge for much more than just a race result. He encounters a rival racer, <a href="../../kurt-dierker/94-13356/" rel="nofollow">Kurt Dierker</a>, who happens to also be a proud Nazi. Dierker kills Sean's best friend, leaving revenge a hot topic on Sean's mind.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The sandbox aspect of The Saboteur can be approached in a variety of ways. You can climb up buildings and use stealth to complete objectives, and travel more quietly through the occupied city, or you can go guns blazing into the fight. Regardless of choice, The Saboteur aims to allow players to fight exactly how they want to. Much of the gameplay is based around Sean's attempts to find, and eliminate, Dierker. This means helping the French Resistance, in the hope of finding answers, and also to push the threat of fascism out of the city of <a href="/paris/3035-487/" data-ref-id="3035-487">Paris</a>.</p><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13313/1372933-gestapo_gs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1372933" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.8978978978979" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:89.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13313/1372933-gestapo_gs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1372933"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/13313/1372933-gestapo_gs.jpg"></a></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Fighting against something as powerful as Nazism and the mechanized blitzkrieg is possible in only one way: sabotage. As Devlin, you must sabotage valuable assets to the German war machine to strike a blow in the face of adversity. Sabotaging enemy items is a key part of The Saboteur, and examples of this include planting bombs on railway bridges, bombing fuel depots, and ambushing soldiers, amongst other subversive acts. In a drive to make sabotage a key element of the game, <a href="/pandemic-studios/3010-1779/" data-ref-id="3010-1779">Pandemic</a> added a unique feature called the 'Will to Fight' system. In areas where the Nazis have full control, the game is in black and white. The only relief to this monotone world is the occasional flash of red that signifies something of value to the enemy, or a flash of blue that indicates something important to the French Resistance. For example: the fuel tank on a hostile enemy vehicle would be red, and the ascot worn by Resistance leader Luc is blue. However, as you continue to strike blows against the threat of fascism, the color of that area of the city slowly returns. The idea behind this is that the Nazis sucked all the vibrancy and life from areas under their oppression. When the color in an area returns, it shows the French citizens are more willing to fight. While areas that are colorful are liberated from the fascist regime, this does not remove all enemy presence. It will, however, make the citizens more willing to rise against the invaders. It also includes benefits in the form of French Resistance rebels that are prepared to slow the Nazis to help Sean escape them. Harassment in the liberated locations are much less frequent, and citizens will occasionally get into fist-fights against the German soldiers.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Considering that Sean is an avid car lover, there are many different vehicles in the game that can be stolen and added to Sean's personal collection. Vehicles in the game are not licensed, but they are authentic to the era. In addition to vehicles, there are some different weapons that can be purchased from the Black Market dealers around the city. These dealers can sell you ammo for your weapons, and - if you can afford it - imported weapons, as well. Weapons in the game are reasonably accurate, and include the staples of any WWII game, such as the <a href="../../mp40/93-265/" rel="nofollow">MP40</a> and the <a href="../../kar-98/93-960/" rel="nofollow">Kar 98k</a>. The importable weapons include the <a href="/tommy-gun/3055-261/" data-ref-id="3055-261">Thompson</a> and <a href="/sten-submachine-gun/3055-2677/" data-ref-id="3055-2677">Sten</a>. Weapons and other such goods are purchased through a currency known as 'contraband'. Contraband is earned by causing damage to the Nazi war machine. For example, bombing a sniper tower or putting that freight train in the ocean will earn contraband.</p><figure style="width: 480px" data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3265/619786-themomentofsilence2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-619786" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3265/619786-themomentofsilence2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-619786"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3265/619786-themomentofsilence2.jpg"></a></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Initially the Nazis you'll encounter are standard fighting soldiers. However, as you anger the aryan invaders, they will send more and more dangerous pursuers after you. These include <a href="../../blimp/93-1039/" rel="nofollow">Zeppelin</a> airships, bombers, the Gestapo, and the fictional Terror Squad. The Zeppelins hover in the air, pelting Sean with extreme firepower. They can be destroyed with anti-aircraft weapons that are frequently mounted on rooftops. Destroying a Zeppelin results in a huge reward of contraband, and a spectacular scene, where it hovers in the air a bit after igniting. Bombers are just that - planes which swoop low over you, and drop bombs. These planes move quickly, but can be taken down as well. The Gestapo have unique vehicles which have a mounted machine gun running along the side. Their cars are also heavier, with more armor, and higher performance. The Terror Squad are fictional super-soldiers who use unique weapons. These weapons also take liberty with history and include an SMG that is more akin to an LMG and an automatic shotgun.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">As you play through the game, you will find different ‘ <a href="../../perks/92-366/" rel="nofollow">Perks</a>’ to upgrade Sean’s abilities. There are three levels to each perk: Bronze, Silver, and Gold. Unlocking the Bronze perk involves nothing more than a simple task, and the tasks grow harder for better perks. The game frequently challenges players to complete different objectives in order to unlock rewards. For example, by destroying four train bridges, Sean can plant explosives without any suspicion. Some of these perk requests make players complete extremely challenging goals; for example: killing 10 Nazis with explosives in less than 10 seconds or gathering up every civilian, race, and Nazi vehicle in the game.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The Saboteur features stealth options, in addition to the standard run and gun choice. If you kill an enemy soldier in hand to hand combat, you can steal their uniform and assume the identity of a Nazi soldier. Doing this means you can enter restricted areas. However, if you get too close to another Nazi, you can be identified as an impostor. The most difficult of these soldiers to avoid are the Gestapo agents, as they can blow covers extremely quickly.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The game begins with Sean Devlin drinking in a strip club called "La Belle du Nuit" (literally, the Beauty of the Night) which is otherwise full of Nazi soldiers, where he is contacted by a Frenchman named Luc. Luc is a member of the French Resistance, and he wants Sean’s assistance in fighting the Nazis. At first Sean treats him with hostility. However, after Luc says that the Nazis are everywhere, and they will continue to be unstoppable until people rise against them, Sean reluctantly accepts the offer. Luc directs Sean to follow him out of the building and get in his car. In the car, Luc tells him of his plans to bomb a German fuel depot. However, he needs Sean’s expertise and skill with explosive weaponry to succeed. The mission goes ahead, and is a success. Sean is thanked by Luc and is told that he will be in contact again. Sean returns to the Belle, where he enters a hidden back room, his safehouse, where he lies down in bed and dreams of events that took place three months ago. The flashback begins with Sean and the rest of his racing team loading their racing car, the Aurora, onto a truck, and then travelling across the border from France into Germany to partake in the 1940 Saarbrucken Grand Prix. Once the group arrive in the small village of Saarbrucken, they store the truck away and Sean, his best friend Jules, and Jules' sister Veronique (whom Sean obviously has feelings for, and which may be reciprocated) head to a local hotel bar. At this bar, the group meet the favourites to win the race: local racers called Team Doppelsieg. Doppelsieg are sponsored by a local automotive factory, and their victories are touted by the Nazis as evidence of the superiority of the aryan race. Their driver is <a href="/kurt-dierker/3005-13356/" data-ref-id="3005-13356">Kurt Dierker</a>. Initially Dierker makes a sexual remark at Veronique, and Sean turns around and punches his rival before a fight with the Doppelsieg workers breaks out.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The fight escalates until the group are outdoors, brawling outside the hotel. This fight is broken off when one of Sean's former lovers, a British woman named <a href="../../skylar-saint-claire/94-13355/" rel="nofollow">Skylar St. Claire</a>, stops to watch. Sean and Jules jump into her car, and proceed to speed off with her in the middle. Skylar seems relaxed about the fact they are driving off in her car, considering the fact that they would have been killed otherwise. After losing their Nazi pursuers, Sean and Jules return to the hotel, where they are informed that Veronique has left the area to return to France, where she will wait on the team to return.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The next day dawns, and it is time to put Dierker in his place. To start with, the race goes in Doppelsieg's favour, and they take an early lead. Sean catches up on them, and passes Dierker on the final corner, practically guaranteeing him a victory. As he does so, Dierker cheats by pulling out a <a href="/p08-luger-pistol/3055-943/" data-ref-id="3055-943">Luger</a> pistol and shooting out the tire on the Aurora. The car spins out on the final straight, and Sean winds up coming last overall in the race. Understandably, he is furious, and intends to deal with Dierker. Vittore, the team leader and mechanic, and Jules and Veronique's father, restrains Sean and tells him it is not worthwhile to get mixed up in something that is 'so large' as the Nazis' beloved poster child. Sean reluctantly backs down, but Jules convinces him to seek revenge on Dierker more subtly. The two follow the German driver into the Doppelsieg facility on the outskirts of the village of Saarbrucken. The two men manage to drive Dierker's racing car off the cliff into the ocean. However, they are captured by security and interrogated by Kurt himself.</p><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1366/1211068-kurt_dierker.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1211068" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.87580299785867" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:87.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1366/1211068-kurt_dierker.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1211068"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1366/1211068-kurt_dierker.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1366/1211068-kurt_dierker.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Dierker, the game's main antagonist.</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">During this interrogation, Dierker reveals to the men that he is able to serve the Reich in "much more valuable ways than merely driving quickly". He is a full Nazi officer, and a specialist in torture and interrogation. Initially he believes that either Sean or Jules is a spy sent by the British to search for Nazi plans at the Doppelsieg factory. Sean denies this profusely, and then Kurt threatens him. Either he admits to being a spy, or Jules dies. Jules and Sean both deny that either of them are spies, and Kurt retaliates by unloading his entire magazine into Jules, killing him.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">After this, Sean manages to escape from the Doppelsieg facility. He happens to be travelling the same route that the Nazis are taking on their way to invading France, but he manages to speed through all the invaders and reach France just in time to evade the blockades. At this stage, the farmhouse that Jules' family resides in is being torched by the Germans. Sean saves Vitorre and Veronique from being killed and rescues them from the blaze. However, when he reveals that Jules died, Veronique grows hysterical, blaming Sean for his death (and losing any feelings she may have had for him). Sean then vows to kill Dierker.</p><figure style="width: 480px" data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39552/1186335-2009_11_06_025357_1920x1080_scrot.png" data-ref-id="1300-1186335" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.56269592476489" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39552/1186335-2009_11_06_025357_1920x1080_scrot.png" data-ref-id="1300-1186335"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/39552/1186335-2009_11_06_025357_1920x1080_scrot.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/39552/1186335-2009_11_06_025357_1920x1080_scrot.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>France: Unwilling to fight</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">After this, Sean wakes up from his sleep and the game returns to three months after the ill-fated race. At this stage, Sean can freely explore Paris.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Missions in The Saboteur are structured in a manner similar to that of Grand Theft Auto. As Sean completes missions for his contacts, he will meet more contacts, and these contacts will request that he fulfill objectives for them as well. After completing some of these missions, you will eventually move on to story critical missions.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">After working with the Resistance for quite some time and making serious headway against the Nazi occupation, Sean is contacted by Skylar St. Claire, who is somehow in France and wants to see him. Though he assumes she wants another of their customary one-night-stands, Skylar drugs his wine and takes him into custody, revealing that she is a British operative; <em>she</em> was the spy Dierker's men were looking for back at the Saarbrucken Grand Prix. Initially Sean dislikes her for capturing him, and blames her for Jules' death, but he begins to be more relaxed about this when he realizes that with the British there to help the Resistance, he could inflict major damage to the Third Reich.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">After some time, Skylar gets in contact with Sean and instructs him to meet her in the French countryside. She wants him to bomb a freight train from the Germans that will be supplying vital armaments to the Nazi forces. To do this, Sean has to plant explosives at weak points in the structure of the bridge.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Skylar then orders Sean to help destroy a Zeppelin airship before it leaves France. However, when Sean arrives it is already preparing to take off. This means breaking onto the Zeppelin, destroying it, and then escaping it. As the ship detonates, he leaps into the ocean below. This ocean happens to be near a German harbour, and the Kriegsmarine investigate.</p><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13313/1373371-mp60.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1373371" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.92401215805471" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:92.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13313/1373371-mp60.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1373371"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/13313/1373371-mp60.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/13313/1373371-mp60.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Cartoon design for the MP60</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Before too long, you are forced into hiding in the Paris catacombs. Unfortunately, the leader of the Black Market dealers made an agreement that he would be spared if he sold out the location of the Resistance headquarters, inside an abandoned slaughterhouse and butchery, to the German military. The Germans are hell-bent on killing any opposition, and send in their Terror Squad, which are the (fictional) elite soldiers of the game. These men are armed with special weapons, such as the Terror Squad <a href="../../terror-mp60/93-3841/" rel="nofollow">MP60</a>. In these catacombs, Luc is trapped under a collapsing piece of rock, where he demands that his fellow rebels kill him, as he feels the Germans would interrogate him, and he would give up information. Sean hesitates to kill him, having grown to like the man despite their rough first encounters, and Veronique fires a single round from her rifle into Luc’s head. Veronique was Luc’s protégé, and she killed him, despite the fact she was a good friend to him. She feels that his death is a tragedy, but the death of them <em>all</em> would be more of a tragedy. She says Luc would have felt the same way.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">After completing the majority of story missions, you are contacted. The 1940 Paris Grand Prix is starting. Dierker will be racing in the event, and Vittore has a plan. However, his plan means that he will be killed: he plans to wire his car with explosives, and rather than overtake Dierker, he aims to detonate himself beside his enemy. Sean tells him that he will enter the race in Vittore's place, but that the only person who will be dying is Kurt. This race means having to drive a sports car neatly through the streets of Paris without setting off the bomb. After completing this race, Sean puts the car into its highest gear, aims it directly at Dierker as he celebrates his victory, and leaps from it. While the car explodes, and destroys the pride of Team Doppelsieg, it does not kill the target. This event terrifies Kurt, and he begins to lose his mind. The Nazis retaliate and fight hard against the resistance, bringing in major reinforcements and brutalizing the citizenry, covering all of Paris in black-and-white once more.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The final mission of the game involves heading to the Eiffel Tower, where Dierker  is making his stand. Upon arrival, Sean discovers that Dierker has completely gone insane and turned on his own men, slaughtering them for imaginary insubordination. He stands at the top of the tower, where he executes a helpless Nazi just as Devlin arrives. Dierker soon realizes he used his last bullet to murder his own man, and finds himself helpless before Sean. He asks, ‘Are we to die here, Irishman?’, to which Sean replies ‘No. You will. I won’t,’ before pulling the trigger. Dierker's lifeless body falls from the tower, and as it hits the ground, the symbolic gesture of killing the German commander restores colour to the entire city. Alternately, if Sean waits long enough, Dierker will be overcome with despair and leap from the top of the tower himself, which has the same effect. Veronique finds Sean as he descends the tower, asking him if it is finally over. However, Sean is aware that while his personal revenge has been fulfilled, the Germans still control most of France and pose a threat to the entire world. Setting the game up for a sequel, he replies</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">"No. We're just getting started."</p><h2>Vehicles</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">All the collectible cars in the game.

In the case of The Saboteur, this DLC is the ‘Midnight Show’. Inside the game box, there is a card insert designed to look like a WWII era ticket. This ticket contains the redeem code for the downloadable content. The Midnight Show grants access to the Belle de Nuit's exclusive basement, adding the ability to play a knife-throwing minigame (in which the player can win the Palomino car) and watch exclusive lapdance animations. Also added are several hiding spots, mostly brothels around the city, and an option to add toplessness to the game. It should be noted that this DLC no longer works on the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 versions of The Saboteur, as the servers the game needs to connect to to authenticate the codes have been taken down by Electronic Arts. However, all of these features are available out of the box in the PC version, which is now available on EA's <a href="/origin/3015-7040/" data-ref-id="3015-7040">Origin</a> service.</p><h2>Box Art and Other Information</h2><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1614/1241273-thesaboteur_pc_us.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1241273" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.4171875" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:141.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1614/1241273-thesaboteur_pc_us.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1241273"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1614/1241273-thesaboteur_pc_us.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1614/1241273-thesaboteur_pc_us.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The official box art of the game.</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The Saboteur was released with the one box art design globally. The design shows Sean Devlin in black and white, with a red <a href="/eiffel-tower/3035-2686/" data-ref-id="3035-2686">Eiffel Tower</a> on a dirty white colored base in the background. The tagline running along the back of the box is “Viva la Vengeance!”.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The game was originally announced simply as "Saboteur". It is unknown why "The" was added to the title. The German release of the game is still called "Saboteur", but there are no confirmed reasons as to why this is. Had the game received the same altered title, it would have been "Der Saboteur".</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The title is not the only thing that is different in the German release. Swastikas and other symbols linking to national socialism have been cut out, as well as two audio excerpts from speeches given by <a href="/adolf-hitler/3005-38/" data-ref-id="3005-38">Adolf Hitler</a>. If the box is turned upside down, it is possible to see Sean's fist clenched in a manner similar to that of the 'raised fist' design. This is normally a symbol of resistance, and fits with the game itself, though this is of course a complete coincidence, and was unintentional on the part of the developers, so should be ignored.</p><h2><b>System requirements</b></h2><ul><li>CPU: Core 2 Duo 2.4GHz or AMD equivalent</li><li>OS: Windows XP SP3, Windows Vista SP1, Windows 7</li><li>Video: Nvidia Geforce 7800 GTX with 256MB of VRAM or ATI Radeon HD 2600 Pro with 256MB of VRAM</li><li>RAM: 2GB or more</li><li>Sound: Direct X 9.0c compatible sound card</li><li>Hard drive: At least 7GB of free space</li><li>Disc drive: Dual Layer 1x or faster DVD Drive</li></ul>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>21616</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/2348796-box_saboteur.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/2348796-box_saboteur.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/2348796-box_saboteur.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/2348796-box_saboteur.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/2348796-box_saboteur.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2348796-box_saboteur.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/2348796-box_saboteur.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[The Saboteur]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>30</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-16/]]></api_detail_url><id>16</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: M]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-5/]]></api_detail_url><id>5</id><name><![CDATA[BBFC: 15]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-12/]]></api_detail_url><id>12</id><name><![CDATA[OFLC: MA15+]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2009-12-08 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/the-saboteur/3030-21616/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21621/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-07-26 15:42:43</date_added><date_last_updated>2015-08-07 01:19:24</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[Wanted: Weapons of Fate is a follow-up to the 2008 film which was loosely based on a graphic novel.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Wanted: Weapons of Fate was developed by <a href="/grin/3010-405/" data-ref-id="3010-405">GRIN Barcelona</a> under a publishing deal with Warner Bros.

Their goal was to create an intense single-player experience.</p><p style="">The game is comprised of 9 distinct chapters, each taking an average of 30-40 minutes to complete, giving the game a length of approximately 5 hours (though there is an achievement for finishing it in under 2 hours on the hardest difficulty).

Like said games, you can navigate from behind cover with the flick of the left stick and the push of a face button, however Wanted attempts to stand out by putting players under constant pressure. That is to say, it is far more effective to constantly shift to a different source of cover then it is to stay static. The enemy A.I is designed in such a way that it will continually try to flush the player out of cover, and if you don't move, you may find a grenade lodged in your backside. Another bonus to jumping around to multiple cover is that it keeps your adrenaline high. Adrenaline in this game is shown on screen with a meter, and when it fills up, Wesley or Cross will be able to pull off special moves such as Assassin Time, which slows down time and allows you to get optimal head shots, as well as bullet curving and so-called "Shrapnel Storms".</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/651670-art_12733_id_5.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-651670" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="960" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 960px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/651670-art_12733_id_5.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-651670"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/3699/651670-art_12733_id_5.jpeg"></a><figcaption>  </figcaption></figure><p style="">As stated above, there is a huge focus on moving between cover, and thus there are a ton of transition animations, designed for many different ways to traverse the area. If you are sharing cover with someone on the opposite side of you, you may reach over cover and stab the person in the head. The A.I may do the same thing. The best strategy is to keep moving.</p><h3>Playable Characters</h3><p style="">In the game's regular campaign, the player will take the control of Wesley or Cross, depending on the level. The two play almost exactly the same, with the exception of the weapons they carry. Early on, Wesley carries only a pistol. Cross, however, can carry dual Hellfire Semi-Automatic Pistols, giving him access to the "Bullet Explosion"/"Shrapnel Storm" ability. Wesley gains these pistols and abilities later in the game.</p><h3>Unlockables</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10024/844920-7.png" data-ref-id="1300-844920" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.546875" data-width="960" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 960px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:54.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10024/844920-7.png" data-ref-id="1300-844920"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/10024/844920-7.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/10024/844920-7.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Unlockable suit!</figcaption></figure><p style="">Fans of the movie complained that the costume Wesley wore in the comic never made an appearance. As a bonus, Grin has added some unlockable costumes, one of which is Wesley's original costume. Other costumes include The Immortal (the game's end boss), Janice (Wesley's overweight ex-boss), a SWAT team leader, the Original Spider (from the graphic novel), and more. It should be mentioned, however, that these costumes have no bearing on the actual gameplay; they are merely extra skins.</p><p style="">More gameplay modes can also be unlocked through entering special codes in the game's codes screen. These modes include Close-Combat Mode, where the player must execute a certain number of close-combat kills in order to progress, and Headshot Mode. Time attack mode is also unlocked upon completion of the game on its highest difficulty. Each of these extra modes has a corresponding achievement for completion.</p><p style="">There are also a number of collectibles to find in the game, which will give you access to special videos, posters, artwork, and comic book covers.</p><h2>Differences from other WANTED fiction</h2><p style="">The game features many changes from the established fiction of the movie and comic series it was based on.</p><p style="">Compared to the movie we see much more of Wesley's mother, who was barely a footnote in the movie. We learn more about the fraternity at large, adding unknown sects to the movie's version of events. Mr. Gibson is also cast as a much more caring father, escaping Paris with his child and lover. As killing Wesley's boss and girlfriend are optional this can be either in line or out of line with their fates of the film, though since there are achievements for killing each of them the player is encouraged to alter their fate.</p><p style="">The changes made from the <a href="http://www.comicvine.com/wanted/49-18009/">comic</a> series are too numerous to name, but here is a short rundown:</p><ul><li>The Fraternity is made up of Assassins rather than Super-villains</li><li>The Fox is based off of <a href="http://www.screened.com/angelina-jolie/14-1390/" rel="nofollow">Angelina Jolie</a> instead of the comic version's being based off <a href="/halle-berry/3040-97385/" data-ref-id="3040-97385">Halle Berry</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="http://www.comicvine.com/mister-rictus/29-41048/">Mister Rictus</a> is completely absent (main villain from comic series)</li></ul><p style="">All of these changes and many more are based on the movie's telling of events, so are not necessarily on the shoulders of any <a href="/grin/3010-405/" data-ref-id="3010-405">Grindividual</a> even though the game was boasted as being closer to the comic than the movie was.</p><h2>Demo</h2><p style="">The demo was released on Thursday March 5th 2009 on the Playstation Network and Xbox Live Marketplace. It shows players the basic tutorials, then proceeds to advanced tutorials for curving bullets and using slow-motion. It also has a playable level; the fourth in the game, where Cross fights his way through an airplane.</p><h2>PC System Requirements</h2><table><tbody><tr><th>Minimum Settings</th><th>Recommended Settings</th></tr><tr><td><ul><li><b>OS</b>: Windows XP SP2 / Windows Vista</li></ul><ul><li><b>Processor</b>: Dual-core processor 2.0 GHz</li></ul><ul><li><b>RAM Memory</b>: 1.5 GB</li><li><b>Hard Drive Space</b>: 8 GB</li></ul><ul><li><b>Video Card</b>: DirectX 9.0c compatible card, shader model 3.0 support</li></ul><ul><li><b>Sound Card</b>: 16-bit Sound Card, compliant with DirectX</li></ul><ul><li><b>DirectX</b>: DirectX 9.0c</li><li><b>Mouse</b>, <b>Keyboard</b></li></ul></td><td><ul><li><b>OS</b>: Windows XP SP2 / Windows Vista</li></ul><ul><li><b>Processor</b>: Dual-core processor 2.3 GHz</li></ul><ul><li><b>RAM Memory</b>: 2 GB</li><li><b>Hard Drive Space</b>: 8 GB</li></ul><ul><li><b>Video Card</b>: Nvidia GeForce 8400 GS / ATI HD 2400 XT HM or higher</li></ul><ul><li><b>Sound Card</b>: DirectX 9.0c compatible</li></ul><ul><li><b>DirectX</b>: DirectX 9.0c</li><li><b>Mouse</b>, <b>Keyboard</b></li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Xbox Hard Drive Installation</h2><ul><li>Wanted requires 6.8 GB of space to be installed to an Xbox 360 HDD.</li></ul>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>21621</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/1/14036/896590-wasted.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14036/896590-wasted.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/1/14036/896590-wasted.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14036/896590-wasted.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/14036/896590-wasted.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/14036/896590-wasted.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/1/14036/896590-wasted.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Wanted: Weapons of Fate]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>19</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-12/]]></api_detail_url><id>12</id><name><![CDATA[OFLC: MA15+]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-16/]]></api_detail_url><id>16</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: M]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-17/]]></api_detail_url><id>17</id><name><![CDATA[BBFC: 18]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-32/]]></api_detail_url><id>32</id><name><![CDATA[CERO: D]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-37/]]></api_detail_url><id>37</id><name><![CDATA[PEGI: 18+]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2009-03-24 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/wanted-weapons-of-fate/3030-21621/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21637/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-07-26 18:01:55</date_added><date_last_updated>2015-01-03 18:02:41</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[Designed both as a Blu-ray movie and a video game, WarDevil is a long-in-development action game built for next-generation systems.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<p style="">Wardevil: Unleash the Beast Within is an open world fantasy action-adventure game for the Playstation 3. The game is being developed by <a href="/digi-guys/3010-6521/" data-ref-id="3010-6521"> Digi-Guys</a> and published by <a href="/ignition-entertainment-ltd/3010-759/" data-ref-id="3010-759"> Ignition</a>. The game uses a new game engine called RTE1080 (Real Time Engine). A Xbox 360 version was cancelled because the developers wanted to focus on one platform and they felt that was the platform where they could achieve the best quality that they are aiming for. It was later stated announced that yet again there would be an Xbox 360 version. They also say to expect levels in such places as ruined wastelands, desert strongholds, ruined hotels, huge bars, and military bases.<a href="/digi-guys/3010-6521/" data-ref-id="3010-6521"> Digi-Guys</a> also released info that they are working on 'an accompanying a Blu-Ray movie that is at least graphically equal to the game. It will be used to debut various characters and scenarios throughout the life of the main WarDevil Project' (PSU, Jan 01/09), entitled WarDevil Chronicles. </p><p style=""> </p><p style="">Nearly five years after being announced, and after months of silence from the developer, WarDevil was reported to be cancelled on October 25, 2010. However, in November of that year Ignition announced that development would be continued on WarDevil under the new codename "Project Kane", and projected a release window of Q4 2011.</p><p style="">It is now January 2015, and almost five years after the <em>last </em>claim that it was still in development, no further word has been heard from WarDevil/Project Kane, so it can probably be safely assumed that the project has finally been cancelled once and for all, and that the developers have moved on with their lives. </p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>21637</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/0/7168/214782-276_163_657_150_a.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7168/214782-276_163_657_150_a.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/0/7168/214782-276_163_657_150_a.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7168/214782-276_163_657_150_a.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/7168/214782-276_163_657_150_a.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7168/214782-276_163_657_150_a.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/0/7168/214782-276_163_657_150_a.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[WarDevil: Unleash the Beast Within]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating/><original_release_date/><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/wardevil-unleash-the-beast-within/3030-21637/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21657/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-07-26 20:32:03</date_added><date_last_updated>2014-01-17 04:48:08</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[Sega's popular Initial D franchise now arrives on the Playstation 3 with Initial D: Extreme Stage.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Initial D:Extreme Stage brings <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/sega/3010-62/" data-ref-id="3010-62">Sega</a>'s popular arcade, and console racer to the Playstation 3.

Shortly after, a personality sphere by the name of Wheatley appears, offering his help in Chell's escape. After escaping from her cell, Chell finds a Portal gun and eventually makes her way to GLaDOS' chamber where there is a breaker room that might trigger an escape pod. Instead, Wheatley accidentally wakes GLaDOS. Upset by the fact that Chell killed her, GLaDOS disposes of Wheatley and throws Chell down an incineration tube.</p><p style="">After about 20 chambers of portals, cubes and fat jokes, a not so dead Wheatley appears and saves Chell. Together, they devise a plan to take GLaDOS down by shutting off her neurotoxin gas and replacing her turrets with defective ones. They then go face GLaDOS who powerless is replaced by Wheatley. In a shocking twist, it's revealed that Wheatley is even worse than GLaDOS. He takes GLaDOS and puts her in a 1.1 volt potato and throws both Chell and the potato down an elevator shaft. It is later revealed that Wheatley was designed by the brightest minds of Aperture as the biggest moron on the planet and was used to shape GLaDOS' personality.</p><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/80630/1765523-wheatley.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1765523" data-size="small" data-ratio="1" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/80630/1765523-wheatley.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1765523"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/80630/1765523-wheatley.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/80630/1765523-wheatley.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Wheatley</figcaption></figure><p style="">After a rough landing, GLaDOS is taken by a bird while Chell is left on her own to explore Aperture's underground. It is here that we are introduced to Cave Johnson who guides the players through test chambers thanks to pre-recorded messages. Chell eventually meets up with GLaDOS who is extremely troubled by Cave Johnson's voice. It is revealed that GLaDOS is not completely evil and has a good, human side to her: Caroline. Caroline was Johnson's assistant and when Cave discovered that he was about to die due to messing around with moon rocks, he created an A.I. to run Aperture once he died: GLaDOS. Inspired by Cave's speech about lemons, GLaDOS decides that the only way to take Wheatley down is by asking him a paradox which should make him crash.</p><p style="">The two make it to Wheatley, who has let the facility run amok by forging blocks with turrets and by not attending to an imminent facility wide meltdown. Despite all this, Wheatley makes Chell test and attempts to kill her to no avail. As the meltdown becomes even more critical, Chell and GLaDOS make it to Wheatley's chamber and take him out by teleporting him to the moon. GLaDOS is put back in control and fixes the impending disaster.</p><p style="">In the end, GLaDOS admits that maybe humans aren't that bad and that she is going to let Chell go. She believes that Caroline taught her this and upon saying this, deletes Caroline from her memory. She reveals that she isn't going to kill Chell because it would require too much effort on her part and she just wants the human to leave. Chell is released from Aperture along with the companion cube.</p><h2>Additional Content</h2><h3>Comic</h3><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/89814/1810633-portal2labrat.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1810633" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.545" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:154.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/89814/1810633-portal2labrat.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1810633"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/89814/1810633-portal2labrat.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/89814/1810633-portal2labrat.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The comic's cover.</figcaption></figure><p style=""><a href="http://www.thinkwithportals.com/comic/#1" rel="nofollow">Portal 2: LAB RAT</a> is a digital comic created entirely in house by <a href="../../valve-corporation/65-1374/" rel="nofollow">Valve</a>. The first part of the comic was first published on April 8th, 2011, with the second released shortly after on April 11th, 2011. On November 16th, 2011, the completed comic saw print in the Dark Horse Comics publication <i>Valve Presents: The Sacrifice and Other Steam-Powered Stories</i> where it was collected with comics produced for other Valve titles <a href="/left-4-dead-2/3030-26782/" data-ref-id="3030-26782">Left 4 Dead 2</a> and <a href="/team-fortress-2/3030-18162/" data-ref-id="3030-18162">Team Fortress 2</a>.</p><p style="">The comic was made to bridge the gap between <a href="../../portal/61-21170/" rel="nofollow">Portal</a> and <a href="/portal-2/3030-21662/" data-ref-id="3030-21662">Portal 2</a>, while also expanding on the history of <a href="../../aperture-science-enrichment-center/95-94/" rel="nofollow">Aperture Science</a>. The main <a href="../../male-protagonists/92-2352/" rel="nofollow">protagonist</a> of the comic is former Aperture Science employee <a href="../../doug-rattmann/94-18516/" rel="nofollow">Doug Rattmann</a> aka "The Ratman" who is accompanied by a <a href="../../weighted-companion-cube/94-22/" rel="nofollow">Weighted Companion Cube</a> for most of the comic.</p><p style="">Images for Portal 2: LAB RAT were drawn by <a href="../../andrea-wicklund/72-100644/" rel="nofollow">Andrea Wicklund</a> (the main story) and the projects leader, Michael Avon Oeming (the layouts and flashbacks). Portal 2's writers <a href="../../erik-wolpaw/72-89532/" rel="nofollow">Erik Wolpaw</a>, <a href="../../chet-faliszek/72-89576/" rel="nofollow">Chet Faliszek</a>, <a href="../../jay-pinkerton/72-97782/" rel="nofollow">Jay Pinkerton</a> and Ted Kosmatka handled the story elements.</p><h3>DLC</h3><p style=""><b>Peer Review</b></p><p style="">The first DLC of the game named Peer Review was released on October 4th, 2011. The DLC was launched across all platforms free of charge. It mainly continues the story of <a href="/atlas/3005-17921/" data-ref-id="3005-17921">ATLAS</a> and <a href="/p-body/3005-17927/" data-ref-id="3005-17927">P-Body</a> assisting <a href="/glados/3005-722/" data-ref-id="3005-722">GLADOS</a> in finding a mysterious intruder in the facility. It also contains a challenge mode for both single player and Co-op options. It allows the player to race certain maps, trying to place the least portals in the shortest amount of time. The player can also compare their scores with other players.</p><p style=""><b>Perpetual Testing Initiative</b></p><p style="">The second DLC of the game was released on May 8th, 2012 and was called the Perpetual Testing Initiative. It enabled a free level editing and sharing service for the game. It was free for the users that have bought the game on PC and is included with the game. Users can create the levels, play them and share them with the community. The level editor uses a simple interface that is different to Hammer. Along with the level editor there is a storyline involving Cave Johnson, test subjects of Aperture Science and multiple universes.</p><p style="">On August 12th, 2012, the Perpetual Testing Initative level editor received a second update that allowed for co-op levels to be built and published as well. This update also added a "Quick Play" feature, which essentially serves as a randomized level select from the Steam Workshop community's top-rated maps.</p><h4>Portal 2 MotionPack / In Motion</h4><p style="">Developed separately by Sixense, the MotionPack was released on the PC on June 16th, 2011 in combination with the <a href="/hydra/3055-3407/" data-ref-id="3055-3407">Razer Hydra</a>. A PSN version was released on November 6th, 2012 under the name "In Motion", and is an adaptation that requires the <a href="/playstation-move-support/3015-4669/" data-ref-id="3015-4669">PlayStation Move</a> to play. Players select to play as either Atlas or P-Body, and then work their way through 20 new test chambers which introduce new mechanics not seen before, such as rotating and scaling objects, and stretching and manipulating materials to solve puzzles.</p><h3>In-game Extras</h3><p style="">In the extras section, players can view the released trailers and teasers for Portal 2, as well as the two-part comic providing backstory. Also available is the <a href="../../developer-commentary/92-2334/" rel="nofollow">developer commentary</a>, which gives insight into the development of the game.</p><p style="">The game also features an "interactive teaser" for <i>Super 8</i>, an upcoming sci-fi film by J.J. Abrams and <a href="../../steven-spielberg/72-3677/" rel="nofollow">Steven Spielberg</a>. In this feature, the player moves around inside a train while listening to chatter on a radio. Eventually, the train crashes and throws the player out. When they come to, they make their way to a scripted section that ends the teaser with a unseen force bursting out of a train car. At the end, the game pulls up a Steam browser window and goes to a promotional site with the actual movie trailer.</p><h3>User Created Content</h3><p style="">As with most Valve games, the mod community in Portal 2 is huge. Only weeks after the game's release, Valve released all the tools the user needed to create custom Portal 2 maps. Soon after, ThinkingWithPortals.com announced their Summer Mapping Initiative, which had all of their community come together to create custom Portal 2 maps over the course of a few months. This was officially supported by Valve on their Portal 2 blog. The winners were announced on June 27th, 2011 on the <a href="http://www.thinkwithportals.com/blog.php?id=5742" rel="nofollow">official blog</a>.</p><h2>Development</h2><p style="">Although the original Portal was a runaway success, Portal 2's existence was not strongly confirmed until March 2010, when <a href="/">Valve</a> released a number of updates for the <a href="/">PC</a> version of the original game. These were unfortunately not made available to console owners due to difficulties getting updates through Microsoft's certification process for the <a href="/">Xbox 360</a> version of the game, and the fact that Valve wasn't involved with the <a href="/">PlayStation 3</a> version at all. The updates altered the <a href="/">ending</a> sequence so that <a href="/">Chell</a> is dragged away by an unseen figure while lying on the ground on the surface after the " <a href="/">boss fight</a>" with <a href="/">GLaDOS</a>. These new game files lead players to discover various clues and hints regarding a potential sequel through Morse code decoding, among forms of decryption of the games files.</p><p style="">Much as the first Portal originated from concepts seen in the 2005 <a href="../../digipen-usa-corp/65-2620/" rel="nofollow">DigiPen</a> Senior student project <a href="../../narbacular-drop/61-12720/" rel="nofollow">Narbacular Drop</a>, some elements of Portal 2 play mechanics have been based off the 2008 DigiPen Junior student project <a href="https://www.digipen.edu/studentprojects/tag/" rel="nofollow">Tag: The Power of Paint</a>. In both cases Valve recruited DigiPen students responsible for the projects to work internally on the Portal teams.</p><h3>Unused Content</h3><p style=""><b>Pneumatic Diversity Vent</b> - Similar to cube tubes in the first game, these vacuum vents are large enough to transport many objects and can even remove loose wall tiles. They appeared in early gameplay videos, but were cut from the game before release. According to Valve, they didn't really have a clear purpose and it was hard to make interesting puzzles with them. While present in some areas in Portal 2, they serve no purpose to the actual gameplay.</p><p style=""><b>Walk on walls Gel</b> - A 4th gel was designed that would let players walk on walls. The game designers admitted that the idea was a good one, opening new puzzle possibilities, but was abandoned due to the fact that game testers were experiencing nausea. Valve tried to minimize the sentiment of nausea by reducing player movement and frame rate but the idea ended up being left out.</p><p style=""><b>Dialogue</b> - A <a href="/garfield/3005-5695/" data-ref-id="3005-5695">Garfield</a> joke was meant to occur during co-op. The two robots stumble upon a comic of Garfield where GLaDOS begins describing what the comic is about and how it is unfunny. In a later scene, GLaDOS reworks the comic so that Garfield accidentally eats poisonous lasagna. The dialogue can be found in the game's files.</p><figure style="width: 160px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/86760/1794422-mel.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1794422" data-size="medium" data-ratio="2.7875" data-width="160" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:278.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/86760/1794422-mel.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1794422"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/86760/1794422-mel.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/86760/1794422-mel.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>MEL - a planned second human character.</figcaption></figure><p style=""><b>Objects</b> - There were multiple switches that were not used in the final version of the game. Such mechanics include a disappearing bed, switches that change the content of a painting and a switch that makes all the furniture fold into itself. There were also signs that were of different colours.</p><p style=""><b>Competitive multiplayer</b> - Along with the co-op, a competitive multiplayer mode was planned, which was, according to Erik Wolpaw, an original take on Speedball (according to Kotaku):</p><blockquote><p style=""><i>We went down that path, actually, for a little while and had something up and running — the best way to describe it is sort of Speedball meets Portal. You know, a sports analogy. And it quickly became apparent that while it’s fun for about two seconds to drop portals under people and things like that, it quickly just devolves into pure chaos. It lost a lot of the stuff that was really entertaining about Portal, which was puzzle-solving.

Between April 1st and 12th, more clues were discovered in the individual games: including hidden codes in the new level layouts of <a href="../../toki-tori/61-3244/" rel="nofollow">Toki Tori</a>, hidden packages in the real world, strange symbols that resembled icons and designs from the pack, and the eventual appearances of hidden "consoles" in the games.</p><p style="">On April 12th, most of the games were "hacked" by GLaDOS. She began to appear in the games in some form, some in special levels made for the game. For example, <a href="../../killing-floor/61-26097/" rel="nofollow">Killing Floor</a> received a new level set in the ruined Aperture Laboratories, complete with giant floor buttons, and also had the default <a href="../../trader/94-17551/" rel="nofollow">trader</a> replaced by a personality core. Later, it was discovered that potatoes found in the bundled games, if enough players find them, would steadily turn GLaDOS "back on" and release the game early. Portal 2 ended up being released approximately ten hours prior to its scheduled release date.</p><p style="">After the game's release, it was reported that the developers of the Potato Sack games were all given access to each others' IPs. They all worked closely with, but independently from, Valve in order to "put the launch of Portal 2 into the community's hands", according to Dylan Fitterer (Audiosurf). Additionally, in the released product, a cryptic audio commentary is attached to a series of images that show that the ARG was a fully planned-out event.</p><p style="">Games in the pack, which for a period were sold and half-price, included:</p><figure style="width: 480px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/58235/1761172-killing_floor_portal_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1761172" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.53333333333333" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:53.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/58235/1761172-killing_floor_portal_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1761172"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/58235/1761172-killing_floor_portal_2.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/58235/1761172-killing_floor_portal_2.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>An example of a crossover between Portal 2 and one of the games from The Potato Sack (Killing Floor).</figcaption></figure><p style=""><i>(*)Denotes games that were "hacked" by GLaDOS</i></p><ul><li><a href="../../123kick-it-drop-that-beat-like-an-ugly-baby/61-33373/" rel="nofollow">1... 2... 3...

Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis and the expansion pack Operation Flashpoint: Resistance. ]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Operation Flashpoint 2: Dragon Rising is a hardcore military simulator in which players carry out the roles of real soldiers in combat zones. Operation Flashpoint 2 is the first sequel from <a data-ref-id="3010-491" href="/codemasters/3010-491/" slug="codemasters">Codemasters</a>; the original developers of <a data-ref-id="3030-5333" href="/operation-flashpoint-cold-war-crisis/3030-5333/" slug="operation-flashpoint-cold-war-crisis">Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis</a>, <a data-ref-id="3010-275" href="/bohemia-interactive-studio/3010-275/" slug="bohemia-interactive-studio">Bohemia Interactive</a>, broke up with Codemasters and released another game, <a data-ref-id="3030-12737" href="/arma-armed-assault-gold-edition/3030-12737/" slug="arma-armed-assault-gold-edition">Armed Assault</a>, with a different publisher. Both Operation Flashpoint 2 and Armed Assault can be said to be sequels to the original Operation Flashpoint.</p><p style="">The game takes place on a Chinese occupied fictional island in the East China Sea called Skira. Though the island is fictional it takes its landscape from the real island of Skira as well as architecture from real islands in the location the game is set. In the game you play as part of the United States Marine Corps tasked with retaking the island. There will also be Russian forces that are allied to the Marines on the island.</p><p style="">The game originally was supposed to let the player explore over 120 square miles of land which takes four hours in real time to traverse on foot, two hours to cross in a vehicle, and twenty minutes to cross in the fastest aircraft. The environmental damage was supposed to be persistent - any damaged or destroyed buildings, infrastructure or even equipment will remain in its state throughout the course of the game, but was cut from the game.</p><p style="">There were originally supposed to be over 50 vehicles and over 66 infantry weapons in the game, but the majority of the weapons and vehicles were cut from the game so that Codemasters could release them as small DLC packs. They are modeled after real-world military equipment. Codemasters intended to show a great attention to detail, with weather affecting the performance of the vehicles and weapons, and weapons wearing down over time, but never did. The game will also feature an in-depth scenario editor for making maps and objectives on the PC version, this feature was intentionally removed from the console version so that Codemasters may exploit console users with small map-packs and mission-pack as DLC.</p><p style="">Operation Flashpoint 2 is running on <a data-ref-id="3015-3524" href="/ego-engine/3015-3524/" slug="ego-engine">Ego</a>, a modified version of <a data-ref-id="3015-2627" href="/neon-engine/3015-2627/" slug="neon-engine">Neon - the engine</a> that powered recent Codemasters racing games, <a data-ref-id="3030-20729" href="/grid/3030-20729/" slug="grid">GRID</a> and <a data-ref-id="3030-3916" href="/dirt/3030-3916/" slug="dirt">DiRT</a>.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style="">The entire plot of Operation Flashpoint 2: Dragon Rising and all of its details have so far not been released, but the main backstory to the game has been revealed. The story for Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising is based on a conflict between China, and the United States over a small Russian owned island on the East China Sea. When petroleum is discovered on the small Russian island of Skira, the Chinese government decides to take over the island, and so it is invaded by The People's Liberation Army. The Chinese quickly take over the mostly undefended island causing an international uproar. In light of these events, the United States decides to send the U.S. Marine Corps to help Russian forces take back control of the island. This marks the beginning of a territorial war between China, and the United States with their Russian allies.</p><h2>Setting</h2><p style="">Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising will be based entirely on a semi-fictional island in the East China Sea called Skira (which is directly based on the island of Kiska.) Skira is 130 square miles in size and will present a variety of environments, in which the player is free to traverse at his will. Skira is a Russian owned island off the coast of Japan on the East China Sea. A variety of environments will be present, including locations such as beaches, woodlands, farms, an oil refinery, and even volcanoes. The landscape and climate will change depending on factors such as, altitude and the presence of human activity. It has been confirmed that the island will feature a full day, and night cycle, and dynamic weather conditions, further increasing the number of different environments. Skira will be the setting for the entire game.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising is a first person, open-ended, military shooter. The two most defining gameplay features for the game are the open-ended sandbox design for the entire game, and its realistic simulation-like feel. The open sandbox for the game will be a 130 square mile island with a diverse, and challenging environment. To traverse this huge landscape the game will present over 50 drivable vehicles, including land, sea, and air based vehicles. As part of the invasion force the player will be given missions to complete. The player may choose from a range of options before engaging on a mission, like what weapons to use, what vehicles to drive, and even how many men will accompany him. The open world will give the player a variety of possibilities when approaching your objective, adding a strategic and tactical element to the game. There will be time limitations for missions since the player is part of an active invasion force. The player may also choose to leave the mission area and explore the island where he may run into enemy patrols, human settlements, and even full-fledged ongoing battles.</p><p style="">The game will be a realistic/simulation military shooter, which means it will contain realistic health, reasonable A.I., and real-world weapons and environments. The player will have a realistic health system, meaning that he will not survive five bullets to the head. the health is based on ballistics and were you are hit so if you are hit in the arm with a 5.56 round you won't die until you bleed out but your aim will be affected. The player must be cautious of not only his health but that of his fellow soldiers. It has been confirmed that the game will contain over 66 real-world weapons, and tons of customizable options. Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising will present a wide range of environments coupled with innovative, yet realistic game play. There will be dismemberment and multiple of map supports.</p><h2>FTE Missions</h2><p style="">The game also offers additional standalone, cooperative missions that you can unlock via codes entered in the Extra section of the menu. These missions can only be played cooperatively online, and are much smaller than the regular campaign missions. They take about 10 minutes each as opposed to the 30 you need to accomplish a regular mission. They usually involve simply clearing out enemies from a given area which means they are generally easier and more action-oriented.

This game is created by Genki, creator fo the Tokyo Xtreme Racer series. This is the second Wangan Midnight game that has been released for home consoles. The first one with the same name was released on the PS2 in 2002 and a sequel to this game has been made for the PSP a little while later called Wangan Midnight Portable.  A story mode as well as some tuning and arcade modes are present in this game. For the PS3, an online mode is available for up to four players total. All cars presented in this game are all licensed cars from Japanese makers.<br/><br/>This game is no way related to Namco Bandai's arcade racer Wangan Maximum Tune series, so the way the game is presented as well as the driving physics are totally different.

The Beast was possessed by an awesome power, and it appeared that the time of man would soon be at an end. It was then, in humanity's darkest hour, that six heroes of unknown origin came forward to defeat the Beast. They brought with them the ancient power of 'magic.' which they freely shared with mankind. Turning their ingenuity to the formation of new, more powerful weapons, humanity discovered a process by which they could infuse their own technology with the power of ancient magic. It was in this way that humanity created the "Armagus' and discovered a power far beyond what magic or technology alone could have given them.</p><p style="">With this new-found power, mankind once again confronted the Beast, with the six heroes fighting alongside them. After many long, blood-soaked battles, the Beast finally fell, ending what would come to be know as 'The First War of Magic.' The heroes who had fought beside human warriors in the First War of Magic were immortalized for their deeds, and through generations came to be known as the 'Six Heroes.'</p><p style="">It was during the First War that an organization was formed to regulate the use of the 'Grimoire Armagus,' the Armagus training texts. Called the 'New World Void Space Cue Administration Bureau,' it was this organization, and the power it wielded through the use of the Grimoire Armagus, that brought about great advances across the spectrum of human technology. These advances threw mankind into a vast and all-encompassing reconstruction.</p><p style="">Decades have passed since the Bureau established itself as a dictatorship and Armagus became the deciding factor in nearly all of humanity's affairs. This has led to a large socioeconomic gap between those who can wield the power of Armagus and those who cannot. Tensions began to flare, and before long a rebel organization calling itself the 'Ikaruga Union' appeared, defying the totalitarian authority of the Bureau, which began referring to itself as the Novus Orbis Librarium Armagus ("The Library"). With the creation of the Ikaruga Union, angry thoughts became open hostilities and 'The Second War of Magic' began. It was this conflict, which also came to be known as 'The Ikaruga Civil War,' that saw humans using the power of Armagus against one another for the first time.</p><p style="">The Second War came to a close with the destruction of the Ikaruga Union. Afraid of further conflict, the Library consummated its subjugation of the populace by issuing the following decree: 'Whosoever chooses to defy the New World Void Space Cue Administration Bureau shall be put to death, without exception.'</p><p style="">Several years after the end of the Second War, a branch of the Library reputed to command a force as powerful as an entire nation's army was suddenly and utterly destroyed. The few survivors spoke in hushed, shaken tones of a single man who had appeared out of nowhere, cutting down all in his path.</p><p style="">His name was Ragna the Bloodedge.</p><p style="">He wages a one-man war against the power of the Bureau, fighting to break its iron grip on humanity's throat. He is a man who has declared war against the world itself.</p><p style=""> </p><h3>~A.D. 2199 Dec~</h3><p style="">"By the end of the year, most citizens were expecting the beginning of an era of unprecedented development. Unfortunately, 2199 was also the year that the Librarium's greatest foe, the man with the highest single bounty on record, Ragna the Bloodedge, was rumored to have appeared in the 13th Hierarchal City of Kagutsuchi. People gave him the nickname Grim Reaper, and it was said that his goal was the obliteration of the Librarium in its entirety. Following the rumors, people began to make their way to Kagutsuchi-some after the incredible bounty on [Ragna's] head others after the "ultimate power" said to be in his possession... and a few whose only interest was his assassination for the Librarium."</p><p style=""> </p><p style="">The story has several different plotlines for the various playable characters that intersect with each other in many ways. Canonically, all these story threads are true, but the explanation is that (except for the True Ending) every single one ends with Ragna falling into the Cauldron with v-13, forming the Black Beast. Then a giant laser beam fired by Take-Mikazuchi at that same Cauldron somehow sparks a time loop which turns the clock back almost a century in time with the first appearance of the Black Beast, erasing the events that happened over and over again.</p><p style=""> </p><p style="">This continues on and on in everyone's story until the loop is finally broken in the True Ending, when Noel saves Ragna from falling into the Cauldron with v-13 and Rachel activates the Tsukiyomi Unit to save Kagutsuchi from destruction. However, it turns out to be part of the evil Terumi's plan all along, who kept manipulating events so the time loop would repeat over and over until events finally conspired to let him acquire the true copy of the Azure Grimoire from Noel. In the end, Terumi escapes to move on to the next part of his evil plan, which involves conscripting Tsubaki Yayoi to hunt down her former classmates Jin and Noel for treason.</p><p style=""> </p><h2>Characters</h2><p style=""><i>BlazBlue</i> features a plethora of unique characters each with their own back stories:</p><h3>Ragna the Bloodedge</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1679/1370816-ragna.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1370816" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="1.4833333333333" data-width="300" style="width: 300px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:148.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1679/1370816-ragna.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1370816"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1679/1370816-ragna.jpg"></a><figcaption> Ragna the Bloodedge</figcaption></figure><p style="">"Ragna is a man with such power that he has become known as the 'God of Death' ( <i>Shinigami</i>, or 'Grim Reaper' in the NA version.)

The game finally saw a release in Europe on April 2, 2010. Contrary to earlier reports and rumors, this version was nearly identical to the North American and Japanese versions of the games, featuring no new characters or changes to preexisting characters. The European version instead featured more character colors and "Unlimited" versions of characters, "super" versions of current characters with better properties on most of their moves.</p><p style=""> </p><p style="">A limited edition of the game was also released that included the game, a two disc soundtrack and a bonus Blu-ray or a DVD depending on the console. The bonus disc showed you the basics of the game as well as going into more details about character specific stuff such as combos and strategies. The videos feature expert players from Dustloop.com and Shoryuken.com. The European limited edition shipped with both a bonus DVD with around 2 hours of tutorials and character-specific strategies and a 96 page full color art book featuring original art and illustrations.</p><p style=""> </p><h3>Handheld</h3><p style="">BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger saw a release on Sony's PSP handheld device on February 25, 2010 in Japan and March 9, 2010 in North America.

The PSP version of the game also featured a mode entirely new to the game, the Legion Mode, a mode in which you choose a character and "conquer a map" by defeating enemy armies. Defeating an enemy army basically boils down to a King of Fighters-esque Team Battle. As you progress along the map and defeat various "armies", you are allowed to recruit characters you have defeated into your squad.</p><p style=""> </p><h3>PC</h3><p style="">A PC version of Blazblue: Calamity Trigger has been announced and is slated for a Japanese release on August 26, 2010. The PC version will feature all of the released DLC--the color palettes and the unlimited characters--included for free. More significantly, the PC version will feature cross-platform play with the Xbox 360 version, allowing owners of the PC version to play against owners of the Xbox 360 version. </p><p style=""> </p><h2>System Requirements</h2><h3>Minimum System Requirements</h3><ul><li>Operating System : Microsoft Windows XP / Windows Vista / Windows 7</li><li>Processor : Intel Pentium IV at 3.0 GHz (XP) / Intel Core 2 Duo (Vista / Win 7)</li><li>Video Card : 256 MB VRAM – NVIDIA Geforce 7900 / ATI Radeon X1900</li><li>Memory : 1 GB RAM</li><li>Hard Disk : 10 GB of free Hard Drive space</li><li>Sound Card: DirectX Compatible</li><li>Direct X : 9.0c</li><li>Controls : Keyboard &amp;

The car was first hinted at the end of in the <a href="/e3-2010/3015-4529/" data-ref-id="3015-4529">E3 2010</a> trailer, with <i>Sebastien Vettel</i> saying the car can "easily reach 400 km/h on straight away".

The player can choose between Nite Owl and Rorschach as playable characters. The gameplay revolves around fighting crowds of enemies, using crowd control effectively and countering incoming attacks. New combos are unlocked by collecting tokens scattered around the levels. Rorschach has a Rage meter that can also be increased by collecting Rorschach cards hidden throughout the levels. Once full, he can go into Rage mode, increasing his speed and damage output, and eventually automatically countering all incoming attacks. He can also expend a part of his Rage meter to perform a Bull Rush, knocking back enemies and dealing damage. Rorschach can also use enemies' weapons, whereas Nite Owl cannot. Nite Owl has a Charge meter which fills up over time and allows him to use Concussion Grenades which daze all enemies around him. When the meter is full, he can unleash a wave of electricity damaging and knocking back all enemies around him, in addition to dealing extra electrical damage with each attack for a time.<br/><br/>The game also features local two-player split screen co-op, but no online functionality.<br/><br/><h2>Story</h2><br/><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/899055-environment_nycity_light_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-899055" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5400390625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:54.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/899055-environment_nycity_light_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-899055"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19745/899055-environment_nycity_light_01.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19745/899055-environment_nycity_light_01.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>There's crime going on here.</figcaption></figure>The story takes place in 1972, several years before the graphic novel. Nite Owl and Rorschach were still operating as costumed vigilantes, as the the bill that illegalizes vigilantes hadn't been passed yet. Upon hearing a police bulletin, Nite Owl and Rorschach make their way to Sing Sing prison to help quell the rioting that has erupted there. Once there, they find out the riots were a ruse to cover up the escape of The Underboss, a crime lord. They make their way to a bar, the Rumrunner, and question one of the patrons to find out who orchestrated the escape. They find out Jimmy the Gimmick was behind it, so they chase him down the docks to an abandoned amusement park. They corner him on the tracks of a roller coaster, where someone activates the carts to try and kill Jimmy. Nite Owl holds them back with his grappling hook but a mysterious sniper shoots the cable, causing the carts to fly right into Jimmy, causing his death. Before dying, Jimmy managed to tell them the Underboss is in his old hideout in the sewers, so that's where Nite Owl and Rorschach go. They don't find him, but they do find the missing FBI associate director, Mark Felt, tied up and bleeding heavily, seemingly tortured. He tells them the Underboss means to kill two reporters, Woodward and Bernstein, the would-be informers of the Watergate scandal. Upon leaving the sewers, Nite Owl and Rorschach are ambushed by the police, Rorschach chiming in that they've been set up. They fight their way through them to get to the construction site where Felt told <br/><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17537/928481-cutscene.png" data-ref-id="1300-928481" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5671875" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17537/928481-cutscene.png" data-ref-id="1300-928481"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/17537/928481-cutscene.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/17537/928481-cutscene.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>"Sing Sing Prison" Chapter Cutscene</figcaption></figure>them Underboss is, only to find that the reporters are already dead.

This version sported a new engine and control scheme, allowing for a different gameplay experience than previous iterations.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<p style=""><br/>NCAA Football is a college football based videogame created by EA Sports. Before the game was released, EA held a vote on the 07 version of the games website allowing fans of the series to vote on what extra feature they would like to see in the Playstation 2 version of the game. Fans were given the choice to vote on: in-game saves, medical red shirts, summer workouts or a lead blocker feature.  The fans decided in the end they wanted medical red shirts and this was then featured in the "Dynasty Mode" feature and was available on ALL platforms instead of just Playstation 2. </p> <p style=""> </p> <p style=""><strong><u>Differences between 360 and Playstation release -</u></strong></p> <p style="">There are a number of differences between the release of the game on the two consoles. The 360 version of NCAA 08 runs at 60 frames per second, making the game look a lot smoother and realistic in animation terms. The PS3 release of the game remains at just 30 frames per second (the same as NCAA 07). Despite being 30 frames behind the 360, PS3's release still features most of the animations and actions found on its rival console. </p> <p style=""> </p> <p style=""><strong><u>Changes and Improvements -</u></strong></p> <p style="">The game features 115 stadiums, which is a great comparison to the 07 release of the game which featured just 40 stadiums. The number of stadiums is not the only thing to change, this game runs on a different animation system and gameplay engine, giving the game a clearer look and also opened to new actions in game for the player, those including: side-line catches and gang tackling. All of which give the game a more realistic and simulation feel. Seening as the looks of the game were improved, so is the control scheme. Blocking control's featured on the best selling Madden games have been incorporated into the 08 release, branching the audience of the game. The next gen consoles also feature a motivation system, meaning players will feel better if they do well in a game. Benefits of this being that it will boost the players attributes and will also cause him cheer on his team mates to boost their momentum. Dynasty Mode is in keeping with the previous game and allows players to export their NCAA players to be exported to Madden 08. </p> <p style=""> </p> <p style=""><strong><u>Player Creation System (Xbox 360 PS3 &amp; Xbox PS2 -</u></strong></p> <p style="">When the player creates a new player and highschool on the 360 and PS3, the game begins at the state championship playoffs and allows the game to decide which caliber the Campus Superstar will be put into (the higher the caliber, the higher the players stats). Throughout the game mode the player will be offered scholarships to different school depending on how well do. The 360 and PS3 versions allow the player to focus just on their Campus Superstar and not control the whole team, however this is unchanged on the Xbox and Playstation 2 version.</p> <p style=""> </p> <p style=""><strong><u>Other Features of the Game - </u></strong></p> <p style=""> </p> <ul class="plain-list"> <li> <div><strong>Mini Games - </strong>A mini game is available to the player called "Point Pursuit". This minigame is basically a normal match, however the player aims to gain points  based on yards they gain, succesful tackles, interceptions, touchdowns etc.</div></li> <li> <div> </div></li></ul> <p style=""><strong>Award Tracking </strong>- A cabinet called "My Shrine" is available to the player to allow them to track their unlocks, trophies and accomplishments throughout their playtime of the game.</p> <p style=""> </p> <p style=""><strong><u>Cover Athlete -</u></strong></p> <p style="">EA Sports announced the games cover star would be Jared Zabransky on March 2nd 2007. The main reason for this being for Zabransky's outstanding year with the Boise State Broncos.    </p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>21951</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/2250719-box_ncaafb08.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/2250719-box_ncaafb08.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/2250719-box_ncaafb08.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/2250719-box_ncaafb08.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/2250719-box_ncaafb08.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2250719-box_ncaafb08.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/2250719-box_ncaafb08.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[NCAA Football 08]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-6/]]></api_detail_url><id>6</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: E]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2007-07-17 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-19/]]></api_detail_url><id>19</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 2]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-2/3045-19/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS2]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-32/]]></api_detail_url><id>32</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox/3045-32/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[XBOX]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/ncaa-football-08/3030-21951/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21965/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-07-29 03:43:33</date_added><date_last_updated>2008-07-29 03:43:33</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[Cipher Complex is a stealth action game coming to the Xbox 360 and the Playstation 3.

Rubi can shoot like in a normal third person shooter, in which the reticule will fire both weapons she is currently holding, but when she jumps, or slides, shooting will activate a slow motion mode similar to that of <a href="/max-payne/3030-2414/" data-ref-id="3030-2414">Max Payne</a>. In this mode one hand will lock onto an enemy by default, while you can free aim the gun in her other hand to shoot at different targets and pull off head shots.</p><p style="">While the game has many instances of normal linear progression, the emphasis for gameplay is placed on "arena" sections, in which Rubi is locked into a confined location, and waves of enemies will continually pour in, until Rubi smashes certain objects, preventing enemies from respawning. The player can move through these sections quickly by putting a quick focus on smashing the enemy spawn locations, but the game grades performance in these areas not just on how quickly you pass through, but also on how acrobatic you were, and how many enemies you killed. For getting high ratings at the end of each arena area, the player is rewarded with points that they can use to upgrade Rubi's weapons, or purchase new acrobatic abilities</p><h3>Acrobatics</h3><p style="">With a focus reminiscent of the <a href="/tony-hawks-pro-skater/3030-7236/" data-ref-id="3030-7236">Tony Hawk</a> franchise, the player is encouraged to use acrobatics at nearly all times during the combat heavy portions of the game. Rubi has a vast array of moves she can use, and can also purchase additional upgrades as you progress through the game. Not only can you attain a multiplier by killing enemies while in slow motion, but you can string together successive moves to advance or maintain a score multiplier. For example; Rubi can slow motion shoot while wall running, then jump, keep shooting, and move into a slide, and finish off whatever enemies there are. Initially, high scores are used merely to unlock more abilities for Rubi, but after finishing the campaign, the player can play previous levels in a score challenge mode.</p><h3>Rage Mode</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1043711-942900_20090602_screen004.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1043711" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1043711-942900_20090602_screen004.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1043711"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1048/1043711-942900_20090602_screen004.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1048/1043711-942900_20090602_screen004.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Rubi is very unhappy.</figcaption></figure><p style="">During some areas of the game, Rubi will enter a room, be charged at by a pretty worthless enemy, shoot him square in the head, and get his blood all over her face. This seems to trigger an almost blood lust like state for Rubi, and she will put on her war face, accompanied by blaring sirens. The game shifts dramatically to a more stylized look, and this is known as "Rage Mode." While in this mode, the focus shifts from an overall combo multiplier to measure score, and instead measures the player's performance purely on their kill count. The kill count still acts as a combo though, and going too long without dispatching a foe will reset the count. Also much like the combo meter, the higher the player's kill count is, the quicker the meter drains.</p><p style="">Rubi doesn't regenerate health in this mode as quickly as she does in the other arena segments, which encourages the player to be far more aggressive with enemies. The player still maintains their acrobatic slow motion abilities though, which is helpful to keep charging enemies at a distance, or for removing large clusters of foes quickly.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style="">As the story begins, Rubi is hired by the son of Mr. Ackers to retrieve a briefcase, which contains a heart that Mr. Ackers needs for an emergency heart transplant. Rubi is successful, and returns to her home in Texas afterward. Some time later, Rubi is approached by Mr. Ackers, to retrieve his son, who he worries has fallen in with a drug cartel in China, and wishes for him to be retrieved, so that he can return to being the heir to the Ackers' drug organization.</p><p style="">After a good deal of time searching for him, Rubi locates Ackers' son, and brings him to the man that hired her. The man and his goons kill him, and then turn on Rubi, rather than paying her. Rubi gets away wounded, and sets off to figure out what happened, so that she can exact her revenge. This leads her to London, where she seeks information on Mr. Ackers, where she storms his mansion and kills many of his men, only to figure out the person that hired her was not actually Mr. Ackers.</p><p style="">Rubi discovers the man she's looking for is Rupert Pelham, who is trying to take over various drug empires to push his own product. As Rubi finally discovers the identity of her real target, she sets off to blaze a trail of destruction, stopping at nothing until Pelham is dead.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><h3><b>Dual Pistols</b></h3><p style="">The default weapon for Rubi, her modified revolvers never run out of ammo, and are always the best weapons for head shots.</p><h3><b>Katana</b></h3><p style="">The sword acts as Rubi's default melee attack, but can be upgraded to be more useful for acrobatic attacks and combos.</p><h3><b>Dual Shotguns</b></h3><p style="">Best used for enemies with a lot of health, Rubi's shotguns pack a tremendous amount of damage at close range.</p><h3><b>Dual Sub-Machine Guns</b></h3><p style="">For dealing with large groups of enemies as quickly as possible, Rubi's best bet is her dual SMGs.</p><h3><b>Dual Explosive-Tipped Crossbows</b></h3><p style="">One of the more unique weapons for Rubi, her dual crossbows fire explosive-tipped bolts, which detonate on contact.</p><h2>Music</h2><p style="">WET's soundtrack boasts featuring both an original score, along with a veritable feast of alt-rock tracks, 35 in total from 20 different bands. The score for the game was recorded over a four day period, and was composed by <i>Brian LeBarton</i> in Los Angeles, featuring an interesting/unusual cast of musicians (such as <i>Carla Azar</i> of the band <i>Autolux</i>). The 'compilation' side to WET's soundtrack features contributions from a plethora of bands and artists, chiefly representing the alternative 'rockabilly' and 'trip hop' music scenes respectively:</p><ul><li><b>Knock Gallery West</b> (<i>Undead West, Murder, As We Ride</i>)</li><li><b>Long Tall Texans</b> <i>(Adventure, Why Did You Lie To Me?)</i></li><li><b>New Skool Kings</b> (<i>Surf Song)</i></li><li><b>The Chop Tops</b> <i>(El Diablo, Teddy Boy Stomp, Radium Rag)</i></li><li><b>Bert Selen</b> (<i>Western Rock)</i></li><li><b>Creepin' Cadavers</b> (<i>Aquarium, Frankie Dig A Hole</i>)</li><li><b>The Gutter Demons</b> (<i>The Offer)</i></li><li><b>Gypsy Pistoleros</b> (<i>Una Para Todo Es Bandido, Switchblade Kiss Comes Close, The Crazy Loco Loquito)</i></li><li><b>Agents Del Futuro</b> (<i>The New Gils)</i></li><li><b>The Arkhams</b> (<i>She's Lost Control, Insane)</i></li><li><b>Three Bad Jacks</b> (<i>Crazy In The Head)</i></li><li><b>The Hypnophonics</b> (<i>Invasion, Romance With A Rapist, Dead Meat, Children Of The Atom, Scream)</i></li><li><b>The Creepshow</b> (<i>Rock N Roll Sweetheart</i>)</li><li><b>The Brains</b> (<i>You're Dead)</i></li><li><b>Corpse Show Creeps</b> (<i>El Matador, Rebel Rock</i>)</li><li><b>Mushroom Lounge</b> (<i>So Fine In The Sunshine)</i></li><li><b>Brasstronaut</b> (<i>Old World Lies, Requiem For A Scene)</i></li><li><b>Echo Pilot</b> (<i>Three Village Sound Clash)</i></li><li><b>Eliazar</b> (<i>Flyin' By)</i></li><li><b>Notorious MSG</b> (<i>Chinatown Hustler</i>)</li></ul><p style="">As you progress through the game, you unlock these songs for sampling in the menus.</p><h2>Development</h2><p style=""><a href="/sierra-entertainment-inc/3010-1030/" data-ref-id="3010-1030">Sierra</a> entertainment was originally publishing Wet, but after <a href="/activision/3010-78/" data-ref-id="3010-78">Activision</a> all but destroyed Sierra, WET was left in limbo. <a href="/bethesda-softworks/3010-786/" data-ref-id="3010-786">Bethesda Softworks</a> then picked up the publishing rights, and released the game in September of 2009.</p><h3>E3 Trailer and Bethesda Softworks Website</h3><p style="">The trailer of WET shown at E3 2009 and the Bethsoft <a href="http://www.bethsoft.com/eng/games/games_wet.html" rel="nofollow">sub-site</a> for WET portraying the game as an homage to grindhouse films and fighting epics such as Kill BIll, using period music, self-referential humor, and over-the-top action and kills. Players can execute acrobatic moves, ranged combat with a variety of weapons including a modded revolver and a shotgun which can be fired in nearly any direction while navigating terrain, and close fighting with swords and fists.

This new frontier has brought new challenges and opportunities, dangers, rewards, &amp; awaits the ultimate discovery: another sentient species.</p><h2>Pre-Release Demo Builds</h2><h3><b>Bullseye</b></h3><p style="">Launch date: December 22, 2009</p><p style="">Bullseye is the first playable chapter of Interstellar Marines. Introducing prototype gunplay to the players, set in an dynamic gunrange where the player has to shoot down cardboard targets in several challenges to level up and unlock upgrades or himself and his weapon. This chapter of Interstellar Marines runs through a browser with the Unity Engine plugin.</p><h3>Running Man</h3><p style="">Launch date: July 2, 2010</p><p style="">The second playable prototype of Interstellar Marines. Alongside the gun model introduced in Bullseye, Running Man added in the game's movement setup to show how they worked together in the Unity Engine. The premise of the demo is that it is an increasingly fatal training program for Interstellar Marine candidates.</p><p style="">The Running Man also served as a prototype/proof of concept for Interstellar Marine's basic enemy AI and pathfinding- as the player is pitted against four varieties of training bots: A standard black variant, a fast moving yellow variant, an explosive white variant, and a tall grey variant that essentially serves as a boss-type entity- and only starts appearing on the second difficulty level.</p><p style="">In addition to the reappearance of the AI SARA, who's voice had been present in the previous Interstellar Marine demos, the Running Man introduced Drill Sergeant Barry. He keeps ordering SARA to send the candidates through increasingly fatal training exercises against the bots, despite SARA's complaints about the rapidly decreasing percentage of candidates passing- let alone surviving.</p><h2><b>Technical</b></h2><p style="">The game is currently testing the Unity Engine for use in creating it as a commercial product.</p><h2>Features</h2><p style="">Singleplayer

While not necessarily a huge commercial or critical success, many hardcore fans consider NHL 2K8 to be the best game in the series due to its superior control, and goaltender animations. <br/> <br/>This was also the first game in the NHL series to support the 2K Reelmaker, which was offered as DLC.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>22131</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/2222541-box_nhl2k8.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/2222541-box_nhl2k8.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/2222541-box_nhl2k8.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/2222541-box_nhl2k8.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/2222541-box_nhl2k8.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2222541-box_nhl2k8.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/2222541-box_nhl2k8.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[NHL 2K8]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-2/]]></api_detail_url><id>2</id><name><![CDATA[PEGI: 16+]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-29/]]></api_detail_url><id>29</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: E10+]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2007-09-10 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-19/]]></api_detail_url><id>19</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 2]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-2/3045-19/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS2]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/nhl-2k8/3030-22131/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-22133/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-07-29 15:25:02</date_added><date_last_updated>2015-03-31 21:42:49</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[The 13th release in the franchise, Armored Core: for Answer is set ten years after Armored Core 4 and sees the largest machines in Armored Core yet called Arms Forts.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11097/852032-armoredcoreforanswer_3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-852032" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.62477876106195" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11097/852032-armoredcoreforanswer_3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-852032"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11097/852032-armoredcoreforanswer_3.jpg"></a><figcaption>White Glint squares off with an Arms Fort</figcaption></figure><p style=""><a data-ref-id="3010-760" href="/fromsoftware-inc/3010-760/" slug="fromsoftware-inc">From Software</a>'s Armored Core: For Answer is the 13th game in the long-running <a data-ref-id="3025-35" href="/armored-core/3025-35/" slug="armored-core">Armored Core</a> franchise. As in other games in the series, players will be in control of large battle mechs that they will use to unleash death and destruction upon their foes. The game features two-player co-op and 8-player competitive modes including Battle Royale and Team Deathmatch. You are a mercenary willing to take on any job as long as it is according to plan. The game features high amounts of customization options, with over 130 pieces of new gear and over 400 total.

The planet has rapidly deteriorated due to human pollution and radiation from <a data-ref-id="3055-4830" href="/kojima-particles/3055-4830/" slug="kojima-particles">Kojima</a> particles, and most of humanity has taken to the huge, airborne Cradles for refuge from Earth's poisonous surface. The League of Ruling Companies rules the Cradles, and while they claim to act benevolently, their actions suggest otherwise. When the Cradles were put afloat, the League deemed the Lynx (AC pilots) too dangerous, stranding them on the planet where they now work as <a data-ref-id="3015-2073" href="/mercenary/3015-2073/" slug="mercenary">mercenaries</a>. Some of these stranded have formed terrorist factions such as Line Ark, which defiantly resists the League, as it believes the Cradles are only a temporary solution to the planet's decay. Some, however, believe Line Ark is not forceful enough, leading to the formation of ORCA by <a data-ref-id="3005-14044" href="/maximilian-thermidor/3005-14044/" slug="maximilian-thermidor">Maximilian Thermidor</a>. Since Armored Core 4, the factions have all been producing huge battle platforms known as Arms Forts to protect points of interest, only increasing the havoc wreaked in conflicts. Between the three factions' squabbles, Earth's surface has become a battlefield.</p><p style="">The player can play through AF: For Answer differently for a total of three different endings: the League and ORCA endings are standard, but a third may be seen if the player chooses a more violent path. The League's ending sees the player crush Line Ark and ORCA, ensuring the League's reign and the Cradles' stability; the ORCA ending has the player destroying the Cradles' power sources, grounding humanity but providing a means of escape from the planet; and in the final Destruction ending, the player and a Lynx named <a data-ref-id="3005-17410" href="/old-king/3005-17410/" slug="old-king">Old King</a> destroy many Cradles and their inhabitants, as well as ORCA and Line Ark.</p><h3>More information:</h3><ul><li>The game takes place 10 years after the events (National Dismantlement War) of Armored Core 4.</li><li>The default name for the protagonist's NEXT in Armored Core For Answer is called "Strayed".</li><li>The former protagonist is now piloting White Glint.</li></ul><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">Armored Core: For Answer plays similarly to AC4. The player's mech has, in addition to the standard arm and shoulder weapons, two leg-based compartments for backup weapons should the player run out of ammunition or wish to change their tactics. Mechs are capable of vertical movement in the form of flying, as in the prequel, and use boosters to quickly traverse the battlefield; in an emergency, the player may activate Overed Boost for a short burst of intense speed. Also returning is the use of Assault Armor, a damaging explosion the player may initiate at the cost of hitpoints. As in AC 4, a mech's condition is measured by Primal Armor (or PA), which functions as shielding; and Armor Points (AP). Energy Points are used for boosting, flying, and firing energy weapons. Customization has been further enhanced since Armored Core 4; over 130 new pieces of equipment have been added. Most parts are available through the ingame store, with the right to purchase them unlocked as the player completes missions for the corporations, but some must be unlocked by getting S ranks on missions or playing through campaigns on Hard mode.</p><p style="">There is also, like Armored Core 4, a list of top rank Lynx you must defeat to get your ORCA rank up. By beating these top pilots you can win parts and more customization points to make your overall stats of your NEXT better.</p><p style="">Online multiplayer for the game includes eight-player game modes Battle Royale, a free-for-all, and Team Deathmatch, as well as the option of cooperative campaign mode. However, players may only start a mission if both have it unlocked.</p><ul><li>Battle Royale is as stated earlier a free for all up to 8 people. It can get pretty hectic on smaller maps and a game of skill on larger maps.</li><li>Team Deathmatch is also like the name suggests that you can team up with others to take down another team. It can be up to 4 on 4.</li></ul><h2>Online Community</h2><p style="">Although be it not huge in the first place, it is probably hard as of now to get achievements or trophies for this game if you are tying to go for the ranked online matches. Not many play Armored Core For Answer online that much anymore.</p><h2>Arms Forts</h2><p style="">Arms Forts are these huge units in the game you have to defeat from time to time. Think of them as boss battles on a massive scale. The Arms Forts have superior power than almost any other unit in the game. You attack some of them using the <a data-ref-id="3055-4654" href="/vanguard-overed-boost/3055-4654/" slug="vanguard-overed-boost">V.OB.

and various mini-games with it.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2><b>Overview</b></h2><p style="">Yakuza 3 is an action game developed by <a href="../../amusement-vision-ltd/65-220/" rel="nofollow">Amusement Vision</a>, and once again it follows the series lead character Kazuma Kiryu. It was released February 26, 2009 in Japan, and March 9, 2010 in the U.S. and March 12, 2010 in Europe. Sega has also been releasing free downloadable content (exclusive to Japan) for the game as of March 5, 2009. These downloadable packs contain 29 new costumes for Kazuma, two-player modes for some of the minigames (including darts, golf and billiard), 8 packs of new items and more. Most of this DLC is made available in Western releases through redemption codes packed into the game or via pre-order bonuses with specific retailers.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p style="">The Yakuza wars are spreading over to the tropical paradise of Okinawa. After leaving his last base in Kamurocho, Kazuma Kiryu went to Okinawa and opened an orphanage named Sunshine Orphanage (U.S.) / Asago (Japan: translated to a flower called Morning Glory) with Haruka (from the first <a href="../../yakuza/61-7180/" rel="nofollow">Yakuza</a> game), a young girl who acts as his assistant. Together with the children they have taken in, the two slowly let go of the violent lives they have led prior to their arrival.</p><p style="">However, the happy days are short lived for the Yakuza are tightly connected with the Japanese government. A shady deal that involves the land that has Kazuma's orphanage on it. After a mysterious man resembling Kazuma's supposedly deceased father shoots <a href="../../daigo-dojima/94-7667/" rel="nofollow">Daigo Dojima</a>, the current chairman of the Tojo Clan, <a data-ref-id="3005-3594" href="/kazuma-kiryu/3005-3594/">Kazuma</a> returns to Tokyo once again.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">The two main areas you will be exploring are Ryukyugai in Okinawa and Kamurocho in Tokyo. They are both fictional areas, although based on the real life locations of Naha's Makishi and Tokyo's red-light district, Kabukicho . They contain lots of activities to enjoy such as bowling alleys, batting cages, noodle houses, bars, and convenience stores. The main gameplay is brawling. Throughout the game <a data-ref-id="3005-3594" href="/kazuma-kiryu/3005-3594/">Kazuma</a> earns experience (through combat, eating and sub-stories) and will learn new moves and techniques as he becomes more and more powerful. Also, Yakuza 3 adds a change to random battle load sequences using a streamlined transition from exploring than jumping right into combat causing the player to stay with the action without a major load time or blank screen. This also is utilized in the new Chase Sequences, where <a data-ref-id="3005-3594" href="/kazuma-kiryu/3005-3594/">Kazuma</a> is forced to attack and force down a fleeing target in order to continue the story.</p><p style="">Yakuza 3 contains many key features that are inherent to the series:</p><ul><li>Arena Fighting</li><li>Bowling</li><li>Billards</li><li>Casino Games</li><li>Batting Cages</li><li>Sega Arcade Games</li><li>Key Lockers</li></ul><p style="">Yakuza 3 adds new features that weren't present in the previous entries:</p><ul><li><b>Karaoke:</b> Another addition to the Yakuza series is Karaoke, containing a total of 6 songs. <a data-ref-id="3005-3594" href="/kazuma-kiryu/3005-3594/">Kazuma</a> can only sing one song, 'Kamurocho Lullaby' as well as <a data-ref-id="3005-17677" href="/haruka-sawamura/3005-17677/">Haruka</a> having her own as well. The other four are accessible by inviting a Hostess, otherwise they involve <a data-ref-id="3005-3594" href="/kazuma-kiryu/3005-3594/">Kazuma</a> clapping and playing small instruments.</li><li><b>Fishing/Golf/Darts:</b> Thanks to the new Okinawa location, <a data-ref-id="3005-3594" href="/kazuma-kiryu/3005-3594/">Kazuma</a> can now access new mini games such as Fishing on the beach in front of the Sunshine Orphanage and Golf, which can be accessed by taking a Cab or Monorail.

Renji Kamiyama runs the Kamurocho branch while his younger brother, Renta Kamiyama, runs the Okinawa store. The weapon crafting adds a unique ability, never before utilized in the Yakuza franchise. Before hand, players would only be allowed to use certain weapons by completing certain side quests or by using specific locker keys. The new Workshop system allows players to start with a basic set of Accessories, Armor &amp; Weapons, than upgrade them to various special forms or editions. While still retaining the same framework of finishing side quests or finding locker keys, the items necessary to craft are now rewards and some may also be found in local stores or pawn shops.</li></ul><p style="">This is also the first Yakuza title to include Playstation Trophy support, adding a total of 45 trophies including the series first Platinum.</p><h2><a data-ref-id="3035-2820" href="/kamurocho/3035-2820/">Kamurocho</a></h2><p style="">Kamurocho is a fictional district of <a data-ref-id="3035-1341" href="/tokyo/3035-1341/">Tokyo</a> that serves as a major setting of the <a data-ref-id="3025-766" href="/yakuza/3025-766/">Yakuza</a> series.

It is a third-person cover based shooter which draws influences from older action-adventure movies and games.</p><p style="">Like its predecessor, Uncharted 2 follows Nathan Drake on his journey to find a mythical treasure with a link to a historical figure; in this case, Marco Polo. However, this game trades the dense jungle environment for a range of exotic and urban locales, including Borneo, Turkey and Nepal.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Overview</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1112519-t_uncharted2_gc2k9_fortune_gt_v2_hd_47.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1112519" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1112519-t_uncharted2_gc2k9_fortune_gt_v2_hd_47.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1112519"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/669/1112519-t_uncharted2_gc2k9_fortune_gt_v2_hd_47.jpg"></a><figcaption>Players are rarely alone throughout Uncharted 2.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Uncharted 2 is made up of a mix between third-person <a href="/cover-system/3015-55/" data-ref-id="3015-55">cover-based shooting</a>, light platforming/traversal, and puzzles. The game's structure is set across 26 chapters, all of which blend together and do not require loading screens to continue. Each chapter, once reached, will then forever be available for players to continue the story from.</p><p style="">What separates Uncharted 2 from other action-adventure games of this ilk is its priority on set-piece driven moments. Throughout the game Nathan Drake will find himself in a number of dramatic scenes, however most of these will still be playable. One example is Drake finding himself within a building that is currently collapsing, only the player must also fight their way through a squadron of enemy soldiers while this is happening. Or another where the player must leap between a number of moving vehicles. Mixing the game's shooting and platforming elements within such bombastic scenarios was designed as the primary appeal, rather than one specific style of gameplay or set of mechanics. Because of its set-piece driven design, however, Uncharted 2 is heavily scripted.</p><p style="">Nathan Drake is more often than not accompanied by one or more friendly NPCS. Though they are invulnerable with infinite ammo and primarily exist for narrative purposes; they can still kill enemies, but the frequency of such is low.</p><h3>Difficulty Settings</h3><p style="">The game features multiple difficulties, including:</p><ul><li>Very Easy</li><li>Easy</li><li>Normal</li><li>Hard</li><li>Crushing</li></ul><p style="">None of them change up the game beyond altering the damage modifiers, however. The highest difficulty setting, Crushing, requires that players first complete the game before undertaking.</p><h3>Combat</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1112535-t_uncharted2_gc2k9_fortune_gt_v2_hd_63.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1112535" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1112535-t_uncharted2_gc2k9_fortune_gt_v2_hd_63.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1112535"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/669/1112535-t_uncharted2_gc2k9_fortune_gt_v2_hd_63.jpg"></a><figcaption>Drake running 'n gunning while on top of a moving train</figcaption></figure><p style="">The shooting is what makes up the majority of the game and features all of the standard mechanics one would expect from a third-person shooter of this nature. Players can take cover against just about any object, transition between different pieces of cover if they're close by, blindfire, utilize a roll to avoid damage, and so on. What's different over most shooters is its implementation within the traversal; should Drake be hanging onto a piece of scenery, he will often still be able to fire his weapon, though only his sidearm.</p><p style="">Melee combat is once again featured as well, and functions with the basic method of timely pressing square. Upon enough damage, or if the player is to counter an enemy attack, players must press square, triangle, square in time with the animations to successfully kill an enemy in a melee struggle. If an enemy has already been weakened enough with gunfire, it's possible that the player will be able to kill them with a single melee hit.</p><p style="">What is somewhat new over the original Uncharted is a slightly larger focus towards stealth. One of the earliest levels of the game, set within a Museum in Turkey, requires that players take out guards without being seen -- doing so will result in instant failure. This is the only section of the game that requires players to use stealth to proceed, though there are opportunities for the player to use stealth instead of engaging in a firefight. More often than not it exists as a means for players to thin the herd before a firefight inevitably erupts, though there are occasions where the player may able to get through an encounter completely with the use of stealth alone. If the player is spotted amidst their attempts to stealth, however, they will not be able to escape the enemy's sight and must then resort to shooting.</p><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/101494/1726026-d7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1726026" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/101494/1726026-d7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1726026"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/10/101494/1726026-d7.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/10/101494/1726026-d7.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Drake hanging on the edge of a cliffside</figcaption></figure><p style="">Much like the TPS gameplay, stealth is generally rather basic. Nathan Drake will naturally go into a crouched stance as he moves about, so as to better keep his presence unknown, and players may then kill enemies quietly by sneaking up on guards and using a melee attack from behind -- which often results in Drake snapping the guard's neck. Other such manoeuvres include Drake being able to pull an unsuspecting guard over cover, should they be resting above the piece of cover the player is resting against. Similarly, players can stealth-kill a guard that is advancing towards them; once they get close enough to the edge of the cover the player is hypothetically hiding behind, a melee attack will instigate a stealth kill. Finally, if Drake is hanging on the edge of the environment, be it a cliff ect., and a guard is standing just above, players can then pull the guard down killing them instantly, regardless of the actual height of the fall.</p><h3>Weapons</h3><p style="">Drake can carry up to two weapons, one primary--such as assault rifles or shotguns-- one sidearm--pistols, micro-uzis--and grenades, all of which are selectable via the d-pad; primary is left, sidearm right, and grenades up. What weapons Drake begins with varies per chapter, though players will sometimes be able to carry over their current weapon-set. Weapons are still most commonly procured in the battlefield, either in the environment or from dead guards.</p><p style="">A list of the weapons within the game are as follows:</p><p style=""><strong><ins>Primary Weapons</ins></strong></p><p style=""><strong>AK47 </strong>-- The most common primary weapon in the game, the AK is a reliable 30-shot assault rifle, great for any and all encounters in the game -- both singleplayer and multiplayer.</p><p style=""><strong>M4</strong> -- The assault rifle alternative, the M4 is better than the AK is every way, with its noticeably higher fire rate and damage output. However it can only be found during the later chapters of the game.</p><p style=""><strong>FAL</strong> -- A burst-fire assault rifle, complete with a short-range scope for more precise aiming. Especially handy for nailing headshots, both for enemy soldiers and enemy players.</p><p style=""><strong>MP40</strong> -- An old WWII-era submachine gun, the MP40 is only collected during one specific section of the story, and is otherwise delegated as an unlockable firearm within the cheats menu. It has a slower fire rate than the assault rifles, but it holds more ammo and is equally as powerful. Its recoil is noticeably higher than both the AK and M4, however. Cannot be used in multiplayer.</p><p style=""><strong>Moss-12</strong> -- A 12-gauge shotgun that can hold up to 6 rounds. It is of course extremely powerful up-close, but falters at range. Makes for a great weapon for running and gunning with due to its potency at close-range. Cannot be used in multiplayer.</p><p style=""><strong>SPAS-12</strong> -- The later game shotgun of Uncharted 2, and like the M4 is exceeds the capabilities of its forbearer in every way. It's faster, more powerful, and can fit more ammo. At close range it's arguably one of most efficient weapons in the game and will kill a player instantly.</p><p style=""><strong>Dragon Sniper</strong> -- The one and only sniper rifle in the game, it is incredibly powerful and offers a high degree of zoom with its scope. However the recoil is incredibly difficult to manage, especially when aiming down the scope. A headshot will kill an enemy player outright, though it also only takes two shots to the body for the same result.</p><p style=""><strong>M32 Hammer</strong> -- A 4-shot grenade launcher, and one that is often only available at the most opportune moments such as involving boss battles. It is really powerful and can easily disperse a crowd with one or two shots. Despite its explosive power, it takes two shots to kill a player in multiplayer.</p><p style=""><strong>RPG 7</strong> -- The ever popular RPG, it can only stock two rockets at a time, though each one of course will do tremendous damage if it hits its target. Even it doesn't hit its target directly, its splash damage may still knock an enemy off balance.</p><p style=""><ins><strong>Sidearms</strong></ins></p><p style=""><strong>45. Defender</strong> -- Standard 9mm pistol, most commonly used by Chloe Frazier. It is the weakest weapon of the game and is primarily only for when the player has no other options. Cannot be used in multiplayer.</p><p style=""><strong>M92F 9mm Beretta</strong> -- Standard 9mm pistol. It is more powerful, more accurate, and has a slightly faster fire rate than the Defender, and is the default pistol of choice for Nathan Drake.</p><p style=""><strong>Micro-Uzi</strong> -- A fully-automatic pistol, one that deals a significant amount of damage due to its very high fire rate. Because of its high fire rate, however, ammo tends to run out relatively quickly. It's an especially useful weapon for quickly blindfiring from the hip and finishing off with a melee attack.</p><p style=""><strong>Wes 44</strong> -- A very powerful 6-shot magnum revolver, most recognizable as Victor Sullivan's weapon of choice. It is rarely available through the game, but is always worth seeking out for its incredible power. Cannot be used in multiplayer.</p><p style=""><strong>Desert 5</strong> -- The late game equivalent of the Wes 44, the Desert 5 is Uncharted's off-brand Desert Eagle equivalent. It is even more powerful than the Wes 44 and also has a larger ammo capacity. However its rate of fire is slightly slower. When used by enemy guards, it is fitted with a laser-sight, though no such feature is available to the player.</p><p style=""><strong>Pistole</strong> -- An old 2-shot pistol, one that is especially effective for blindfiring from the hip due to its high fire rate, and because of its short range. Though because it only stocks 2 shots at a time, missing with it can prove fatal.</p><p style=""><strong>Crossbow</strong> -- Found only during the final few chapters of the game, it is best used against the Shambala guardians, as it can kill them with a single shot; any other weapon will require a copious amount of gunfire. Cannot be used in multiplayer.</p><p style=""><ins><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></ins></p><p style=""><strong>Shield </strong>-- Taking up the player's primary slot, this will be able to shield against gunfire. However, it isn't indestructible, and after so much gunfire will eventually break, which will leave the player highly vulnerable to further attack -- it also cannot defend against explosives. When equipped, it can be used a melee weapon, useful for 'stunlocking' enemies. Should players wish to unequip it, rolling will automatically do so.</p><p style=""><strong>MK NDI</strong> -- The grenades of Uncharted 2, they can be aimed with an arc, or thrown blindly. Their power is substantial, though they can sometimes be tricky for reaching enemies beyond medium range. Whence thrown, they will blink with a flashing red light and beep, alerting any players to their presence.</p><p style=""><strong>GAU 19</strong> -- A heavy machine gun, one that is so heavy in fact that it will bring players to a steady walk when equipped. Its power is great, however, and while it requires a short build up, once it begins firing it won't take long before whatever it is targeted at perishes. Though despite this, players are still extremely vulnerable due to their limited movement speed, and are especially vulnerable to flanking. Players can at least drop the weapon by rolling, and it will not have replaced whatever primary weapon a player initially had equipped.</p><p style=""><strong>Propane Tank</strong> -- Found throughout the game, propane tanks can only be temporarily equipped, and will slow the player's movement and forces them to use their sidearm while holding on to one. If a player hurls it, firing any weapon right after will make it explode, regardless of whether it actually hits the tank or not.</p><h3>Platforming/traversal &amp; Puzzles</h3><p style="">The common alternative to the combat is puzzles, which are often in line with the platforming. Players can leap, hang, and shimmy along surfaces. The traversal is largely automated, as while Drake still requires player inputs, most traversal obstacles are plainly laid out for the player to leap across, often there to provide a sense of scale rather than challenge. Platforming too is very specific and is only involved when the game demands its use.</p><p style="">Most puzzles will require the player browses through Nathan Drake's journal. It includes many clues and hints Drake himself has picked up upon and jotted down through his journey, alongside a lot of humorous doodles to serve as comic relief. It will be continually filled in automatically as the story goes on and does not require any player interaction beyond scrolling the pages.</p><h3>Collectibles &amp; Cheats</h3><p style="">Like the original, there are 101 treasures to be collected throughout the story. They are represented as a shiny twinkle and each one has its own unique model. There is one especially unique treasure that acts as an <a href="/easter-egg/3015-2/" data-ref-id="3015-2">easter egg</a> for Naughty Dog's <a href="/jak-and-daxter/3025-366/" data-ref-id="3025-366">Jak and Daxter</a> franchise. Whereas all other treasures are counted up per chapter, the 'Precursors Stone' treasure is completely hidden.</p><p style="">Players cannot do anything with the treasures themselves, though collecting them will contribute towards points that can be spent on a number of unlockable doodads such as character skins, weapons, filters, developer diary videos and more. Most of which will require that players first complete the story, however.</p><h2>Story</h2><h3>Main Characters</h3><h4><a href="/nathan-drake/3005-162/" data-ref-id="3005-162">Nathan ''Nate'' Drake</a></h4><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1969912-1305730664_nathan_drake.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1969912" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.1365430149961" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:113.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1969912-1305730664_nathan_drake.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1969912"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/1969912-1305730664_nathan_drake.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/1969912-1305730664_nathan_drake.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">The charming treasure-hunter returns, this time to attempt to beat the insidious war-criminal, Zoran Lazarevic, to the mythical Chintimani Stone.

Right before making their daring escape, Sully tells Drake that he won't be joining him in Nepal as the risks are too high for a man of his age.</p><p style="">Nate arrives at Pokhara only to find that Zoran has torn it apart, going through every last temple. Drake gets some help from the local militia and meets up with Chloe. They decide that whichever temple Marco Polo wants them to find must have the same symbols on it as the symbols found on the dagger. So they decide to stick to the rooftops, ultimately finding which temple they must go to. After an epic helicopter chase, the couple finally find the temple. On the way, they bump into <a href="/elena-fisher/3005-290/" data-ref-id="3005-290">Elena</a> and her <a href="/jeff-the-cameraman/3005-12955/" data-ref-id="3005-12955">camera man</a>. She's investigating Lazarevic, wanting to prove that he's still alive. All four of them enter the temple and after solving a couple puzzles, find a secret room in which there's a map. Drake sticks the dagger into a hole that makes a map appear, indicating that the stone and Shambhala are somewhere in the Himalayas. Zoran and his men find the temple and Drake fights his way out of it. When they arrive in the temple's main court yard, they find Elena's camera man who's been shot. Chloe wants to leave him behind but Drake takes him anyways. They end up getting caught, at which point Chloe points her gun at Drake so as not to lose her cover. Zoran and Flynn come and the camera man is executed. As Zoran and Chloe leave, Flynn is about to execute Drake and Elena when they manage to escape.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1112553-t_uncharted2_gc2k9_fortune_gt_v2_hd_81.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1112553" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1112553-t_uncharted2_gc2k9_fortune_gt_v2_hd_81.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1112553"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/669/1112553-t_uncharted2_gc2k9_fortune_gt_v2_hd_81.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/669/1112553-t_uncharted2_gc2k9_fortune_gt_v2_hd_81.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">As Nate and Elena escape, they decide to head for the trainyard as that is where Zoran is headed as he plans to take a train up to the Himalayas and find the stone. They make it to the train yard just as the train is leaving. They hijack a jeep and Drake jumps onto the train. He fights his way through the train before bumping into Chloe. They argue, Chloe hating Drake because he chose Elena over her safety, that her cover could have been blown and she could've died. Suddenly, a shot is fired and Drake collapses, clutching his abdomen. Flynn appears, happy because he thinks he's finally killed Drake. As Flynn sends men out to finish off a retreating Drake, our hero manages to blow up part of the train, sending him and half the train off a cliff, bringing us back to where the story started. As Drake saves himself from the train wreck, he must fight Zoran's men who've come looking for him and steal the dagger that is in fact the key to Shabalha. After killing everyone, Nathan collapses in the snow, having given up on surviving. When all hope seems lost, a man comes out of the blizzard and carries Drake away.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1112544-t_uncharted2_gc2k9_fortune_gt_v2_hd_72.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1112544" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1112544-t_uncharted2_gc2k9_fortune_gt_v2_hd_72.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1112544"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/669/1112544-t_uncharted2_gc2k9_fortune_gt_v2_hd_72.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/669/1112544-t_uncharted2_gc2k9_fortune_gt_v2_hd_72.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Nathan Drake wakes up in a small Tibetan village. He's reunited with Elena and introduced to an old man called <a href="/karl-schafer/3005-12659/" data-ref-id="3005-12659">Karl Schafer</a>. Schafer tells him that he must find the stone but Drake tells him that he isn't interested anymore. The old man sends him on an expedition into the mountains with <a href="/tenzin/3005-12660/" data-ref-id="3005-12660">Tenzin</a> so that Drake can see why he must find the stone before Zoran does. In the caves, Drake discovers yeti like monsters and Schafer's old expedition team, who were in fact SS. Schafer had killed them so the Nazis couldn't get a hold of the stone's powers. On their way back, they discover that the small village has been attacked by Zoran's men and that Karl and the dagger have been taken. After fighting a tank and securing the city, Elena and Nate go after Zoran and Flynn. They make it to a temple. Drake finds Schafer who's been shot. He tells him that he must destroy the stone and dies in his arms. He also finds Chloe. He convinces her to give him the dagger and promises her to kill Zoran. Elena and Nathan find a secret passage to Shambhala which they unlock using the dagger. However, they get caught once again by Zoran's men who force Drake to lead them to the secret city. Once they finally get there, they're violently attacked by blue colored monkey men, guardians of the city who are enhanced with the power of the stone. Before they were the ones dressed up as yetis attacking Drake in the caves. Thanks to the chaos, Drake, Chloe and Elena manage to escape.</p><p style="">As Drake makes his way to the stone, he realizes that said stone is in fact embedded in resin in a giant tree. When they arrive at the tree, they discover a wounded Flynn who detonates a grenade, killing himself as well as wounding Elena. Drake leave Elena in the care of Chloe as he goes to confront Zoran. The evil Russian is at the source of the tree. He drinks its resin, making him invincible. As he tries to kill Drake, our hero kills him by blowing up pockets of resin. As he does this though, the tree begins to die and the city to collapse. He defeats Zoran, leaving him to be finished off by the city's guardians. Drake, Chloe and a dying Elena narrowly make it out of the city alive.</p><p style="">The final scene happens at the small Tibetan village, during Schafer's funeral. It's revealed that Elena survived her wounds and when Chloe asks Drake if he really loves Elena, he answers yes. Sully arrives as Chloe leaves. Sully, clearly interested in Chloe, chases after her, leaving Nathan and Elena alone, ending the game on a romantic note.</p><h2>Competitive Multiplayer</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/1272152-4359589670_8cfffd6daf_b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1272152" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/1272152-4359589670_8cfffd6daf_b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1272152"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/30036/1272152-4359589670_8cfffd6daf_b.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/30036/1272152-4359589670_8cfffd6daf_b.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Uncharted 2: Among Thieves introduces multiplayer to the franchise, with both competitive and cooperative game modes. As players complete multiplayer matches, they earn cash, which is Uncharted 2's version of <a href="/experience-points/3015-39/" data-ref-id="3015-39">experience points</a>. Cash goes towards the player's persistent <a href="/leveling-up/3015-475/" data-ref-id="3015-475">leveling up</a> progression, which in turn unlocks the availability of multiplayer items, such as character skins, taunts, and boosters. These boosters act as <a href="/perks/3015-366/" data-ref-id="3015-366">perks</a> for the player, providing things such as increased accuracy, faster reloading, increased ammo capacity, etc. There are two booster slots for the player, each with their own unique set of boosters. whenever a multiplayer item is unlocked, the player can only use it if they choose to purchase it using the cash they have earned.</p><h3>Competitive Game Modes</h3><p style="">All competitive game modes divide the players into two teams, Heroes and Villains, with a maximum of 10 players per match (5 vs 5).</p><ul><li><b>Deathmatch</b> - This is actually a <a href="/team-deathmatch/3015-2463/" data-ref-id="3015-2463">Team Deathmatch</a> mode, where players score points by killing the opposing team. First team to 50 kills wins. Deathmatch also includes variations on the mode. These variations include Sniper Rifles and Pistoles (Where you can only use those two weapons) and Pistols and Grenades (Same as other variation but this time you only use pistols and grenades). You can't search for these types of modes, but when you're in a lobby, the players vote on one map/mode or another. You are not guaranteed to be able to vote on these variations every time you play, but will come up often.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Elimination</b> - This is a <a href="/last-man-standing/3015-4788/" data-ref-id="3015-4788">Last Man Standing</a> mode, where players are given no respawns. A player scores a point for the team by being the last player alive in the round. First team to score 3 points wins.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Plunder</b> - A <a href="/capture-the-flag/3015-25/" data-ref-id="3015-25">Capture the Flag</a> mode, but with a "treasure" acting as the flag. Players score a point by bringing the other team's treasure to their base, but the treasure will drastically reduce the speed at which the player can run, and also confines the player to only be able to use their sidearm. First team to score 5 points wins.</li></ul><ul><li><b>King of the Hill</b> - Players attempt to capture and hold a specific zone on the map. Their score increases as long as they hold that location. First team to 50 points wins.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Turf War</b> - A <a href="/conquest-mode/3015-1099/" data-ref-id="3015-1099">Conquest</a> game mode, where players must try to capture and hold 3 different waypoints on the map. The more waypoints held, the faster the team's score increases. First team to 250 points wins.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Chain Reaction</b> - A variation on Conquest, players start at opposite ends of the map, and attempt to capture 5 waypoints. Players must capture them in order, with one side moving from waypoint 1 to 5, and the other side moving from 5 to 1. First team to capture all 5 wins.</li></ul><ul><li><b>The Lab</b> - A primarily deathmatch focused mode that was used to test out certain variables, such as restricting the weapon selections to just one or two power weapons and additions. Naughty Dog also reported that The Lab was to help prepare for Uncharted 3's multiplayer, such as weapon-balancing in particular.</li></ul><h3>Default Maps</h3><ul><li><b>The Ice Cave</b> - A bristling cave drowning in snow, The Ice Cave resembles a small labyrinth complete with multiple pathways, separating the two spawn points at each end, and plenty of flanking opportunities. There are primarily three pathways: one of which leads underground, while the other two circle around the underground arena, eventually reaching the opposing spawn point. There also exist a minor few situated perches for snipers, two for each side, though they're so exposed and easily overwhelmed that they're often not recommended.</li></ul><ul><li><b>The Lost City -</b> One of the larger maps within Uncharted 2, The Lost City is an adapted environment taken from the <a href="/shambhala/3035-2601/" data-ref-id="3035-2601">Shambhala</a> chapters during the single player. It still retains its lush and beautiful appearance, with the sun bearing down throughout the map. It is largely symmetrical with a small tower situated in the middle, offering a fair game for both factions. Besides the small balconies on each side and the tower in the middle, there exists a small underground tunnel that stretches beneath near enough the entire map; it offers a somewhat more secluded means of travel, but such a prospectus opportunity--complete with the Grenade Launcher residing within the middle--creates a wild juxtaposition as players sometimes swarm within.</li></ul><ul><li><b>The Plaza</b> - The Plaza is the most open of all the maps within Uncharted 2; based at night-time, it features a huge open battleground based within the middle, separated by a symmetrical make-shift base-of-sorts for both factions with a busted tower in the middle featuring a ruptured floor for players to find a shotgun, or at the very least to potentially hide from the opposing team. Broken down buildings offer up plenty of sniping opportunities and the large open-space that permeates the map offers up a non-stop stream of gun-battles. The Plaza was one of three maps along with The Temple and The Village that was apart of the Uncharted 2 multiplayer beta.</li></ul><ul><li><b>The Sanctuary -</b> Similar in scope to The Plaza, The Sanctuary is a rather large map, though it differs for being more enclosed. Another cold environment, The Sanctuary gives off a chilling scene with snow draped over most of the buildings present; it isn't nearly as thick as is seen in The Ice Cave, however. This map too separates the main-battleground with two opposing towers, both offering substantial cover and opportunities to make sniper-perches. The entire map is fairly elaborate, offering up multiple routes to go from point A to point B; the middle ground being the most straight-forward, with an underground passage accessible via four different passageways culminating into the map's circular core. In the middle is also a bridge, separating two more towers adjacent to one another, with four corner towers surrounding the entire middle. Plenty of high-ground to take advantage of, leaving the middle-ground sometimes an absolute death-zone.</li></ul><ul><li><b>The Temple -</b> Trading in the outdoor environments, The Temple is predictably situated within a large temple. It is designed fairly similarly all the same, with two opposing symmetrical entrances for the factions, but this time with two centred battlegrounds. One on a lower level, the other higher, they are both attached to the hallways that each faction gains access to as the match begins and gives the player the choice for which battleground they will storm first. There also small segues to possibly hide in, and the remains of what looks like an upper-balcony residing in the middle of both battlegrounds, giving a solid survey over most of the map. The Temple was one of three maps along with The Plaza and The Village that was apart of the Uncharted 2 multiplayer beta.</li></ul><ul><li><b>The Train Wreck -</b> Similar to The Ice Cave, the Train Wreck is almost entirely encased in snow, caused by the raging blizzard that flows throughout. The map is mostly on a single level of ground, but is littered with derelict trains that make good use for hiding. There are bits and pieces of small cover littered all over, however The Train Wreck is second to The Plaza for being the most open map of the lot. The blizzard that encompasses the map can still deteriorate players vision and can make long-range combat somewhat unreliable at times; the blizzard varies with its ferocity, sometimes forcing players to rely solely on spotting any enemy name-tags with their reticule. After so often, one of the broken down trains will fall off the cliff edge, revealing an RPG - 7 launcher for players to vie for.</li></ul><ul><li><b>The Village -</b> The smallest map of the lot, The Village encompasses the Tenzin's own village shown is disarray as it was sieged by Zoran. The map itself features a small number of enclosed huts, with their low-height rooftops accessible to players for some higher ground. Most of the fighting will be fought on equal ground as the map is fairly flat overall; a lot of close-quarters gun-play and flanking to be had. After so long, a tank will eventually barge out of a wall outside of the map and storm its way through the map, attacking anyone its heavy machine-gun can catch. It cannot be destroyed and should be avoided at all costs as it makes its route. On the plus side, it does also unlock the RPG - 7 launcher within the broken down wall it crashed for players to try and claim.</li></ul><ul><li><b>The Fort -</b> The Fort was the first post-launch map to be released; it was made available for all, for free, through a mandatory online update for Uncharted 2. The Fort is an adapted environment of a large fort from an Indonesian jungle during Uncharted: Drakes Fortune. It's design is mostly situated as a kind of gauntlet, with each faction spawning on each end of the map with plenty of cover in between; this particular set-up is most agreeable for campers and snipers--especially since FAL assault rifles spawn alongside the players at each side of the map. There is also an underground, and a couple of side passages, though the main frontier is easily summarised to the ground floor action.</li></ul><h3>DLC Maps</h3><ul><li><b>The Highrise</b> - One out of two DLC maps that came with the Survival multiplayer DLC pack. The Highrise covers across the rooftops of <a href="/nepal/3035-2932/" data-ref-id="3035-2932">Nepal</a>, with scattered debris and broken down buildings to allow plenty of maneuverability and flanking opportunities. There are multiple sniping positions, and because of the height of the map accidental deaths from falling between the buildings are easy to succumb to. Every so often a siren will sound, alerting players that an incoming attack helicopter is on its way. It will periodically shoot down parts of the environment, opening up different passages to travel across, and for extra weapons to spawn.</li></ul><ul><li><b>The Museum</b> - The other DLC map apart of the Survival multiplayer DLC pack, The Museum is easily the largest map out of the entire cast, almost resembling a labyrinthine with its many corridors, halls and rooftops to traverse across. Because of its large size, The Museum is a haven for snipers, offering plenty of cover and against the night-sky can marginally better players stealth capabilities.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Flooded Ruins -</b> Also a DLC map, the Flooded Ruins is map introduced via the Uncharted: Drake's Fortune pack, alongside one more map--both taken and adapted from environments from UDF's campaign. Flooded Ruins is set during the parts s apart of the single-player campaign as Nathan Drake and Elena Fisher are attempting to lose Eddy Raja's pirate gang; Gabriel Roman's chopper will also fly overhead during a match much like it did during the campaign. The map consists of a lot of busted down structures amidst a courtyard, with a temple suffering a large gaping hole in its ceiling, residing in the middle. Because of the face-high rubble scattered about, it leaves plenty of opportunities for ambushes and stealth kills - and at the very least a substantial amount of cover for getting around. The Temple offers sniping positions to counter the large sea of ground-combat the rest of the map indefinitely erupts.</li></ul><ul><li><b>The Facility</b> - Much like Flooded Ruins, The Facility is taken and adapted from an Uncharted: Drake's Fortune set-piece. This time it is set around the time as Nathan Drake is contesting against both Gabriel and Atoq Navarro's mercenaries, but also Spanish zombie-like creatures who were cursed by the evil of El Dorado, <i>The Golden Man.</i> The Facility itself is rather worn down, covered in rust with plenty of loose pipes for players to take advantage of with their traversal abilities. The Facility is also fairly large, though not quite as large as The Museum. It features a chasm of hallways, all separated by a German U-boat.</li></ul><h3>Character Skins</h3><p style=""><b>Heroes:</b></p><ul><li><a href="/nathan-drake/3005-162/" data-ref-id="3005-162">Nathan Drake.</a></li><li>Heist Drake.</li><li>Winter Drake.</li><li>Donut Drake.</li><li><a href="/victor-sullivan/3005-1833/" data-ref-id="3005-1833">Victor Sullivan.</a></li><li><a href="/elena-fisher/3005-290/" data-ref-id="3005-290">Elena Fisher.</a></li><li>Winter Elena.</li><li><a href="/chloe-frazer/3005-8982/" data-ref-id="3005-8982">Chloe Frazer.</a></li><li>Winter Chloe.</li><li><a href="/tenzin/3005-12660/" data-ref-id="3005-12660">Tenzin.</a></li><li><a href="/jeff-the-cameraman/3005-12955/" data-ref-id="3005-12955">Jeff The Cameraman.</a></li><li><a href="/karl-schafer/3005-12659/" data-ref-id="3005-12659">Karl Schafer.</a></li><li><a href="/marco-polo/3030-5088/" data-ref-id="3030-5088">Marco Polo</a> (skeleton).</li></ul><p style="">DLC Heroes:</p><ul><li>Uncharted: Drake's Fortune <a href="/nathan-drake/3005-162/" data-ref-id="3005-162">Drake</a>.</li><li>Wetsuit Drake.</li><li>Uncharted: Drake's Fortune <a href="/victor-sullivan/3005-1833/" data-ref-id="3005-1833">Sullivan</a>.</li><li>Borneo Sullivan.</li><li>Winter Sullivan.</li><li>Uncharted: Drake's Fortune <a href="/elena-fisher/3005-290/" data-ref-id="3005-290">Elena</a>.</li><li>Wetsuit Elena.</li><li>Heist <a href="/chloe-frazer/3005-8982/" data-ref-id="3005-8982">Chloe</a>.</li><li>Borneo Chloe.</li><li><a href="/rika-raja/3005-14907/" data-ref-id="3005-14907">Rika Raja</a>.</li><li><a href="/cole-macgrath/3005-6399/" data-ref-id="3005-6399">Cole MacGrath</a> Hero.</li><li><a href="/tomas-sevchenko/3005-3090/" data-ref-id="3005-3090">Sev</a>.</li><li><a href="/nathan-hale/3005-479/" data-ref-id="3005-479">Nathan Hale</a>.</li><li><a href="/zeke-dunbar/3005-10861/" data-ref-id="3005-10861">Zeke Dunbar</a>.</li></ul><p style=""><b>Villains:</b></p><ul><li>Dragen (Heavy armoured soldier).</li><li>Tetram (Gas mask soldier).</li><li>Sark (Face-mask soldier).</li><li>Lovac (Headphones soldier).</li><li>Vodnik (Balaclava soldier).</li><li>Zorskel (Skull-mask soldier).</li><li><a href="/harry-flynn/3005-12657/" data-ref-id="3005-12657">Harry Flynn.</a></li><li>Heist Flynn.</li><li>Winter Flynn.</li><li><a href="/zoran-lazarevic/3005-12658/" data-ref-id="3005-12658">Zoran Lazarevic.</a></li><li><a href="/lieutenant-draza/3005-14373/" data-ref-id="3005-14373">Lieutenant Draza.</a></li><li><a href="/genghis-khan/3005-2182/" data-ref-id="3005-2182">Genghis Khan</a> (skeleton).</li></ul><p style="">DLC Villains:</p><ul><li>Dead Explorer.</li><li>Skelzor (skeleton).</li><li>Glowzor (skeleton).</li><li>Platzor (skeleton).</li><li>Mac (Eye-patch pirate from Uncharted: Drake's Fortune).</li><li>Prakoso (Yellow tank-top pirate from Uncharted: Drake's Fortune).</li><li>Javier (Pilot mercenary from Uncharted: Drake's Fortune).</li><li>Dutch (Grenade Launcher mercenary from Uncharted: Drake's Fortune).</li><li>Blain (Aviator mercenary from Uncharted: Drake's Fortune).</li><li>Dillon (Shades mercenary from Uncharted: Drake's Fortune).</li><li><a href="/navarro/3005-2611/" data-ref-id="3005-2611">Atoq Navarro</a>.</li><li><a href="/gabriel-roman/3005-2742/" data-ref-id="3005-2742">Gabriel Roman</a>.</li><li><a href="/eddy-raja/3005-2735/" data-ref-id="3005-2735">Eddy Raja</a>.</li><li><a href="/daniel-pinkerton/3005-14906/" data-ref-id="3005-14906">Daniel Pinkerton</a>.</li><li><a href="/cole-macgrath/3005-6399/" data-ref-id="3005-6399">Cole MacGrath</a> infamous.</li><li><a href="/helghast/3015-195/" data-ref-id="3015-195">Helghast Soldier</a>.</li><li><a href="/chimera/3015-760/" data-ref-id="3015-760">Chimeran Hybrid</a>.</li></ul><h2>Multiplayer Events</h2><p style="">During the course of Uncharted 2's multiplayer when it was most populous, Naughty Dog would introduce certain events for specific holidays. They would most often include an experience multiplier and would sometimes even place pre-set skins for players to play as over the usual cast. All of those skins were completely exclusive to the events and would not be released for download once the events were up.</p><h3>Thanksgiving 2009/2010</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2270337-uncharted_2__among_thieves__16.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2270337" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2270337-uncharted_2__among_thieves__16.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2270337"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2270337-uncharted_2__among_thieves__16.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2270337-uncharted_2__among_thieves__16.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">To celebrate the US holiday, Thanksgiving, Naughty Dog implemented a 2 week double experience run for players worldwide. Players were also restricted to only playing as Donut Drake on the Heroes side, and Donut Lazarevic for the villains. Naughty Dog would also do another Thanksgiving event with the same available skins, and a 2x experience increase. Donut Lazarevic is one of few skins that has never publicly been made available for use outside of the Thanksgivings event.</p><h3>Christmas 2009</h3><p style="">Soon following after Thanksgiving, Naughty Dog initiated the Christmas 2009 Event. Similar to the Thanksgiving event prior, the player's experience gain was doubled. This time players were restricted to only playing as Default Drake while he wears a Santa hat, and Winter Flynn wearing a paper party-cracker crown around his head.</p><h3>One Year Anniversary - 16/10/10</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39162/1558788-2010_10_15_anniversary_weekend.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1558788" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.562" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39162/1558788-2010_10_15_anniversary_weekend.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1558788"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/39162/1558788-2010_10_15_anniversary_weekend.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/39162/1558788-2010_10_15_anniversary_weekend.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Anniversary Drake skin</figcaption></figure><p style="">To celebrate the one year anniversary for Uncharted 2, Naughty Dog held a 24 hour event, offering a 5x experience bonus and an Anniversary Drake skin for all who participated.</p><p style="">They recorded that over 2.5 man years of game-time transpired across the 24 hour event, with a whopping 1,079,850 games played, 12,376,755 player kills and 49 billions worth of experience accumulated.</p><h2>Boosters</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Slot One Title</th><th>Description</th><th>Slot Two Title</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><b><u>Point and Shoot</u></b></td><td>Increase pistol blindfire accuracy.</td><td><b><u>Bandoleer</u></b></td><td>Carry more ammo.</td></tr><tr><td><b><u>From The Hip</u></b></td><td>Increase long gun blindfire accuracy.</td><td><b><u>Scavenger</u></b></td><td>Get more ammo from each pickup.</td></tr><tr><td><b><u>Sure Shot</u></b></td><td>Better accuracy when aiming pistols</td><td><b><u>Keep Firing</u></b></td><td>More bullets in each clip.</td></tr><tr><td><b><u>Down The Irons</u></b></td><td>Better accuracy when aiming long guns.</td><td><b><u>Fleet Foot</u></b></td><td>Move faster while aiming.</td></tr><tr><td><b><u>Break Up</u></b></td><td>Increased damage to breakable objects.</td><td><b><u>Sure Foot</u></b></td><td>No knockdown from explosions.</td></tr><tr><td><b><u>Turtle</u></b></td><td>Move faster with the riot shield.</td><td><b><u>Scoped In</u></b></td><td>Reduced pain wobble while scoped in.</td></tr><tr><td><b><u>Hell Blazer</u></b></td><td>Move faster with the GAU -

It allows up to only three players maximum and none of the modes can be played alone. The unlockable boosters do not apply for the cooperative modes, however there are a separate set of upgrades for cooperative-only. They are all passive weapon upgrades and near enough every weapon in the game has the same three available: increased reload speed, increased blindfire accuracy, increased overall accuracy.</p><p style="">The host player gets to choose the difficulty level for the co-op game modes, to which there are four: Easy, Normal, Hard and Crushing. Easy - Hard all virtually play and appear the same, with them only increasing the damage/health modifiers for the enemies. Crushing mode, however, actually turns all of the mercenaries undead, with their default face models being replaced with pale white skulls. They still function the same and can be killed through the exact same tactics as in the lesser difficulty modes.</p><p style="">If a player is killed, his teammates are given a short window to revive them before the are permanently eliminated. If all players are killed, the team gets to restart at the last checkpoint. Teams are given 3 retries to complete the level. The same character skins from the competitive modes still apply towards the Arena and Hunter modes, though Adventure is loosely centered around a small narrative and thus has fixed characters for players to control.</p><p style="">Initially both the Survival and Gold Rush coop modes forced players to stick to preset characters. Once the 1.07 update become live, players were allowed to head in with their personally selected profile Hero skins.</p><h4>Modes</h4><ul><li><b>Co-op Adventure -</b> There exist three maps, all of which play out with a superfluous narrative, largely reminiscent from specific set-pieces from the main campaign.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Survival</b> - A <a href="/horde/3015-3021/" data-ref-id="3015-3021">horde</a>-like game mode, players must survive 10 waves of enemies. Each wave gets increasingly more difficult. All maps from the competitive modes can be applied for this mode as well.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Gold Rush -</b> Similar to Survival, Gold Rush asks players to transport a golden idol from one side of the map to the other. The players will face the exact resistance as they did during the Survival mode (including which enemies spawn on which enemies), though this time they are infinite and will not stop spawning until the idol has been placed within the box. Once completed, all enemies currently in the map die instantaneously. The box players must take the idol to is also randomised each time. All maps from the competitive modes can be applied for this mode as well.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Siege</b> - Similar to Survival and Gold Rush, players must defend the marked territory from waves of NPC enemies. Points can only be scored if all of the players are in the marked territory. After each round, the marked territory will change and enemies will become more difficult. This mode is only available if you purchase the Siege Expansion Pack. All maps from the competitive modes can be applied for this mode as well.</li></ul><h4>Adventure Maps</h4><ul><li><b>Nepal - Characters: Nathan Drake (Default), Chloe Frazer (Default) and Victor Sullivan (Default).</b></li></ul><p style="">Here Nate along with his trusty adventurin' cohorts, Chloe and Sully, embark across the war-torn streets of Nepal, fighting against a huge swarm of Serbian mercenaries as the trio attempt to locate a batch of golden relics. They'll contend with a multiple variety of mercenaries, including the heavily armoured ''mutants'', as Nate calls them, equipped with massive GAU machine guns. Eventually the three will find themselves at the City square, with the treasure heavily guarded by a squadron of mercenaries. After killing them all, Nate celebrates their find and calls dibs on the large golden idol.</p><ul><li><b>The Village - Characters: Nathan Drake (Winter), Elena Fisher (Winter) and Tenzin (Default).</b></li></ul><p style="">Nate, Elena and Tenzin quickly grab word that Tenzin's village is soon to be attacked; just as they arrive, they are quickly ambushed and forced to fight their way through. Finding a hostage tied up, the hostage alerts them of more hostages in the village. The three set out fighting their way against heavy resistance, eventually finding themselves contending against a tank. Thanks to an RPG - 7 stash within the Village, the three destroy the tank and with it scare off the remaining mercenaries, saving the Village.</p><ul><li><b>The Sanctuary - Characters: Nathan Drake (Winter), Elena Fisher (Winter) and Chloe Frazer (Winter).</b></li></ul><p style="">Nate along with both of his fiery love-interests must find and destroy the Communication Tower, so as to thwart any more mercenary recruitments. The trio must now clamber their way up the Sanctuary itself to reach to destroy the tower. They naturally must still combat against an army of mercenaries, of all sizes, as they fight their way through. Once they reach the location where Nate will plant the explosive device for the tower, they are ambushed by a huge array of snipers perched on the rooftops way above them all. Alongside the marksmen, many more ground-level mercenaries--including more GAU toting <i>mutants</i>--make their presence known. The three against all odds still prevail; Nate finally plants the bomb and three quickly retreat to escape the blast radius.</p><h2>Downloadable Content</h2><p style="">On November 27th, 2009 a new multiplayer map called The Fort was patched into the game for free. The Fort is based on the chapter 5 level "The Fortress" in the first Uncharted game. (It's debatable whether or not this is actually DLC, considering it is automatically patched into the game with a title update.)</p><p style="">On January 28th, 2010 the "PlayStation Heroes Skin Pack" was released for purchase, and contains 7 new multiplayer skins; <a href="/sev/3005-929/" data-ref-id="3005-929">Sev</a> and a <a href="/helghast/3015-195/" data-ref-id="3015-195">Helghast</a> soldier from <a href="/killzone-2/3030-20601/" data-ref-id="3030-20601">Killzone 2</a>, <a href="/nathan-hale/3005-479/" data-ref-id="3005-479">Nathan Hale</a> and a <a href="/chimera/3015-760/" data-ref-id="3015-760">Chimera</a> from <a href="/resistance-2/3030-20699/" data-ref-id="3030-20699">Resistance 2</a>, and <a href="/cole-macgrath/3005-6399/" data-ref-id="3005-6399">Cole</a> (both good &amp; evil versions) and <a href="/zeke-dunbar/3005-10861/" data-ref-id="3005-10861">Zeke</a> from <a href="/infamous/3030-20599/" data-ref-id="3030-20599">inFAMOUS</a>.</p><p style="">On February 25th, the "Drake's Fortune Multiplayer Pack" was released for purchase, and contains 6 new multiplayer skins and 2 new maps based on characters and locations from the first Uncharted game. The skins include Drake’s Fortune Nathan Drake, Drake’s Fortune Elena Fisher, Gabriel Roman, Atoq Navarro, Eddy Raja, and Javier the mercenary. The new maps are The Flooded Ruins (based on the chapter 10 level "The Customs House" in Uncharted: Drake's Fortune) and The Facility (based on the chapter 18 level "The Bunker" in Uncharted: Drake's Fortune).</p><p style="">On April 22nd, the "Siege Expansion Pack" was released for purchase, and includes six new multiplayer skins, two new maps, and a new co-op multiplayer game mode. The new skins include Wetsuit Drake, Baseball Shirt Drake, Prakoso, Platzor, Glowzor, and Dead Explorer. The two new maps are called Highrise and The Museum, based on locations from the single player campaign of Uncharted 2. The new game mode is called Siege, and is much like the co-op Survival mode, except the players have to hold off waves of enemies while defending a specified zone. The only way for players to score points is for all the players to be within the zone. The location of the zone changes after each wave of enemies.</p><h2>References</h2><h3><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064115/" rel="nofollow"><b>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</b></a> (1969 film)</h3><p style="">In the cutscene immediately following Chapter 4 and preceding Chapter 5 ("Trouble in Nepal"), Nate and Sully are forced to jump off a very high cliff into the water below in order to escape from their pursuers. When Nate tells Sully they have to jump, Sully says, "Hold on there, Sundance - you gotta be outta your mind." This is a direct reference to a very similar scene in the film where the younger Sundance Kid tells the older Butch Cassidy they have to jump off a sheer cliff into a river below in order to escape law enforcement officers who are chasing them.</p><h3>Apocalypse Now (1979 film)</h3><p style="">In the middle of Chapter 12, after Drake uses a zip-line to get down to the train yard, Drake says "I love the smell of train yards in the morning". This is a direct reference to a line in Apocalypse Now when Col. Kilgore says, "I love the smell of napalm in the morning."</p><h3>Air Force Once (1997 film)</h3><p style="">One of Drake's random lines after pushing an enemy off the train is "Get off my train!", a reference to the "Get off my plane!" line from Air Force One.</p><h2>Install Data</h2><p style="">Uncharted 2 does not have any install.

The Darkness II is developed by <a href="/digital-extremes/3010-2159/" data-ref-id="3010-2159">Digital Extremes</a> (as opposed to <a href="/starbreeze-studios-ab/3010-1768/" data-ref-id="3010-1768">Starbreeze</a> who developed the first one) and was released on February 7th, 2012. The game continues the adventures of <a href="/jackie-estacado/3005-241/" data-ref-id="3005-241">Jackie Estacado</a> who's now a full fledged mob boss in New York City. The game features brand new Darkness attacks as well as a new cell-shaded art style intended to evoke the style of the comic-books.</p><p style="">The famously versatile voice of <a href="/mike-patton/3040-82285/" data-ref-id="3040-82285">Mike Patton</a> returns to supply The Darkness with the ghastly shrieks and grunts it has become synonymous with. However, Patton is the only reprising voice actor from the original Darkness, with the rest of the returning characters featuring different voice actors - including Jackie himself, who was voiced by <a href="/brian-bloom/3040-78378/" data-ref-id="3040-78378">Brian Bloom</a> instead of <a href="/kirk-acevedo/3040-82283/" data-ref-id="3040-82283">Kirk Acevedo</a>.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">The Darkness II is a first person shooter. The player controls Jackie from the first person perspective. The gameplay focuses mainly around gunplay and using The Darkness. Jackie can pick up any firearm and can dual wield smaller weapons such as uzis. Ammo can be picked up off enemies or by finding ammo crates. Jackie can carry two light weapons plus a large firearm (shotguns &amp; assault rifles) at a time.</p><p style=""><a href="/the-darkness/3015-2100/" data-ref-id="3015-2100">The Darkness</a> is what sets <a href="/the-darkness/3025-1422/" data-ref-id="3025-1422">The Darkness</a> from other first person shooters. Acquired roughly 15 minutes into the game, it can only be used in the darkness which encourages the player to shoot out lights and destroy generators scattered around the environment. The Darkness is comprised of two sentient tentacles that can be independently controlled with two different triggers or keys.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2123357-evolution0402.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2123357" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2123357-evolution0402.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2123357"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/39/2123357-evolution0402.jpg"></a><figcaption>Dinner time.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The left head can be used to grab objects and people. Once grabbed, the object or person can be thrown or devoured. Throwing objects can be useful since they can impale enemies or cut them in half. Devouring enemies can be used to gain health or ammo. The animation is different and is determined by which part of the body you grabbed the enemy by (legs, torso or head). Finally, objects such as car doors can be grabbed and used as shields.</p><p style="">The right head is used to strike enemies and destroy barriers and objects. Controlling this tentacle is similar to analogue combat in Dead Island. Pressing the right trigger and a direction on the analogue stick causes the tentacle to swipe up, down, left or right. This sometimes slices weakened enemies in half or can be used to slam air born enemies to the ground, sending out a shockwave that stuns other enemies. The strike tentacle can also be used to stun an enemy so he can be grabbed by the grab tentacle.</p><p style="">Across the majority of the story, Jackie is accompanied by an AI-controlled Darkling. He will primarily follow to give support, such as attacking an enemy allowing Jackie to grab him, or will at least provide comic-relief (such as urinating on corpses) and act as a guide, showing Jackie where to go next. Through a specific upgrade, Jackie is eventually able to pick up the Darkling like any other object and throw at an enemy, which will result in the Darkling beating his prey to death. The Darkling can be temporarily 'killed', even by the player, but will always resurface soon after.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2206578-darkling_render06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2206578" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.717" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:71.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2206578-darkling_render06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2206578"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2206578-darkling_render06.jpg"></a><figcaption>'ello, monkey.</figcaption></figure><p style="">On two occasions during the story, the player will gain control of the Darkling after he is forced to separate from Jackie. Because of his small stature, the player is encouraged to play stealthily during these segments - moving through air vents and executing enemies from behind. Should the player wander into a light source, they will quickly die. Though much like when he's an AI companion, the Darkling will respawn soon after should he perish, with all of the player's kills persisting no matter how many times they may die.</p><p style="">Throughout the game, Jackie will earn "Essence", which serves as the game's currency for upgrades. The upgrading system is made up of four "trees", with each tree associating to a specific field of Darkness abilities. The player spends their accumulated Essence points towards various upgrades of their choosing. For instance, some abilities allow Jackie to replenish additional health by devouring the hearts of those he kills, while other abilities grant the player a physical shield, protecting them from projectiles. The game allows the player to respec as they choose, at the cost of additional Essence points.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p style="">The Darkness II picks up some time after the first game and stars Jackie Estacado. The game lets you view a video when starting a new game called "Previously on The Darkness" which summarizes the plot of the first game. The plot is told through first person dialogue scenes (which can be skipped) and during loading screens where Jackie gives a monologue about what The Darkness is doing to him and how much he misses his now dead girlfriend, Jenny.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2123366-review_only_3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2123366" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.56614583333333" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2123366-review_only_3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2123366"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/39/2123366-review_only_3.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/39/2123366-review_only_3.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Weird Visions.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The game starts with Jackie going to dinner at an italian restaurant that he owns. It's suggested that he hasn't used The Darkness in quite some time, having realized that The Darkness was consuming him. While having diner with some pretty ladies, bullets start flying in the restaurant and a truck (which crashes through the restaurant) nearly kills him and horribly disfigures his leg. Having no other choice, he's forced to call upon The Darkness to survive the hit.</p><p style="">After surviving the assassination attempt, Jackie and his crew search to know who ordered the assassination attempt. It's discovered that one of the patrons of the restaurant (Swifty) gave Jackie's position away to the assassins so Jackie decides to start his investigation by paying the patron a little visit. During his quest, Jackie has surreal visions of Jenny, where he reveals that he would rather live in an imaginary world with her than in the real world.</p><p style="">Swifty is only a pawn to a larger association called the Brotherhood. The Brotherhood's leader, Victor Valente, wants the Darkness for himself in order to control the world. Jackie is captured by the Brotherhood and crucified. This kills Jackie and as the Darkness works on reviving him, Jackie is transported to a mental asylum. There, Jenny is a doctor while Jackie's men are all patients or guards of the mental institution. Jenny explains to Jackie that there is no such thing as the Darkness and he's not a mob boss. The Darkness is in fact a mental illness and Jackie's crazy. Jackie doesn't accept this but before he can ask more questions, he wakes up nailed to a cross in front of Victor. Victor uses a siphon to start extracting the Darkness. Jackie finds the strength to take the nails out of his hands and escape just as the Brotherhood attack his home and murder his aunt.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2123353-evolution0365.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2123353" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2123353-evolution0365.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2123353"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/39/2123353-evolution0365.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/39/2123353-evolution0365.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Victor.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Dead set on getting even, Jackie attacks the Brotherhood head on. As he's doing this, he has vivid visions of Jenny and makes a trip to the asylum. Jackie begins to doubt his sanity, wondering if the Darkness isn't just something that lives in his mind. It's revealed that the siphon used to extract the Darkness can also make it stronger. The Darkness explains that it owns Jenny's soul and if he doesn't get the siphon, she'll rot in hell for eternity. It's also revealed that a polar opposite of the Darkness exists: the Angelus. The Angelus is, like the Darkness, a celestial being who wishes to fill the world with light. The Angelus can only use a woman as a host.</p><p style="">Jackie is captured by the Brotherhood, put in an iron maiden and the Darkness is drained from him. He's saved by a darkling and manages to get the Darkness back. He finds out that Victor has brought him to his father's house (which is full of Darkness relics) and that Victor still holds a majority of the Darkness's essence and the siphon. Jackie eventually defeats Victor and gets the siphon back and in a sudden plot twist, Jackie kills himself as he knows that the siphon is the only thing that can permanently kill him and take him to the Darkness where Jenny is being held.</p><p style="">Instead of ending up in hell, Jackie finds himself in the mental asylum. Realizing that the asylum and the visions of Jenny were all fabricated by the Darkness in order to keep him in check, Jackie commits suicide and ends up in hell where he defeats the Darkness by freeing Jenny. Jenny and Jackie spend a few final moments together before the screen fades to black.</p><p style="">In a post credit cutscene, it's revealed that Jenny is the Angelus and that by defeating the Darkness, Jackie has paved the way for the rise of the Angelus. As a now transformed Jenny escapes hell, Jackie is left trapped inside the Darkness.</p><h2>Vendettas</h2><p style="">Vendettas is a mode where the player plays as one of 4 hit men who each have specific Darkness powers and go on missions for Jackie. The Vendettas campaign happens at the same time as the game's main campaign and focuses on securing dark relics from Brotherhood agents. The campaign can be played offline alone or online co-operatively with other people (there is no split-screen). There is also a hit list option where players can replay specific missions from the Vendettas campaign as well as new ones specific to the Hit List mode. Each character has their own upgrade tree.</p><h3>Characters</h3><h4>Inugami</h4><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2206629-dii_vendettas_inugami1_610x343.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2206629" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.56229508196721" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2206629-dii_vendettas_inugami1_610x343.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2206629"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2206629-dii_vendettas_inugami1_610x343.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2206629-dii_vendettas_inugami1_610x343.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Out to get revenge for the murder of his family, Inugami sports a darkness imbedded samurai sword (Kusanagi) as well as the ability to sprint longer and use the swarm ability.

Unfortunately for our protagonist, however, just an hour after he is released, his girlfriend, Nikki, is taken hostage and his brother, Tony, is taken by the mafia.<br/><h2>Gameplay<br/></h2>2 Days to Vegas presents itself as a 3rd person "cinematic action" game, taking place in a sandbox (though it is likely very instanced, as it takes place over several cities), similar to the Grand Theft Auto and Saint's Row series. The game is said to include other aspects, such as stealth missions, and the overall idea that the game as a whole is intended to be the equivalent of an American action film. The game includes the standard weapon set, "from all sorts of pistols to RPGs." Melee combat in the game will be done using Quick-Time Events, though more is to be revealed about the technology and design behind this.  One notable feature of the game is the fact that the entire game is set over a 48 hour time period. It has been confirmed that there is no multiplayer.   <br/><br/><h2>System Requirements<br/></h2> <br/> Recommended System<br/><ul class="plain-list"><li>Quad-Core Processor</li><li>4 GB of RAM</li><li>Nvidia GeForce GTX 280 or similar</li><li>Unknown Hard-Drive Space</li></ul>Minimum System <br/><ul class="plain-list"><li>Dual-Core Processor</li><li>2 GB of RAM</li><li>Nvidia GeForce 8600 GTS or similar<br/></li></ul>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>22427</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/1/12978/378567-2daystovegas.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/12978/378567-2daystovegas.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/1/12978/378567-2daystovegas.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/12978/378567-2daystovegas.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/12978/378567-2daystovegas.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/12978/378567-2daystovegas.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/1/12978/378567-2daystovegas.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[2 Days to Vegas]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating/><original_release_date/><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/2-days-to-vegas/3030-22427/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-22513/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-07-31 04:42:29</date_added><date_last_updated>2012-10-06 12:08:56</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[Mobile Suit Gundam: Crossfire was a launch title for the PS3.

The game's soundtrack features 28 Metallica tracks and 21 tracks from other artists such as The Sword, Foo Fighters, and Danzig. Tracks from each Metallica album, even the live album S&amp;M and the cover album Garage Inc are featured. While all versions of the game come with the track "All Nightmare Long" from their latest album, Death Magnetic, the rest of the album is available for download on the Playstation Network and Xbox Live Marketplace.</p><p style="">In various interviews, Metallica has stated that they are pleased and honored that <a data-ref-id="3010-78" href="/activision/3010-78/">Activision</a> is devoting an entire team to make a game entirely focused on their music. <a data-ref-id="3005-7623" href="/lars-ulrich/3005-7623/">Lars Ulrich</a>, the band's drummer and co-founder, said that it will be a treat for fans. Long time lead guitarist, <a data-ref-id="3005-9125" href="/kirk-hammett/3005-9125/">Kirk Hammett</a>, said that fans and even those who haven't discovered Metallica yet will fall in love with the game, because it gives players the feeling that they are really up on stage playing the songs and creating music.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13692/1250892-guitar_hero_metallica_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1250892" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13692/1250892-guitar_hero_metallica_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1250892"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/13692/1250892-guitar_hero_metallica_1.jpg"></a><figcaption>Enter Sandman in full-band mode</figcaption></figure><p style="">Career mode progression works similarly to the one found in <a data-ref-id="3030-20684" href="/guitar-hero-aerosmith/3030-20684/">Guitar Hero Aerosmith</a>, while maintaining the gameplay found in <a data-ref-id="3030-20673" href="/guitar-hero-world-tour/3030-20673/">Guitar Hero: World Tour</a>. In the beginning, players take control of Metallica performing a two-song setlist. This triggers the story by inspiring a local band to follow Metallica on tour and play as an opening act. The band will follow Metallica around to key arenas which commemorate some of their most memorable gigs. This will include arenas such as the Tushino Airfield in <a data-ref-id="3035-38" href="/russia/3035-38/">Russia</a> for where they played to a crowd of 500,000 people free of charge in 1991, as well as The Forum in <a data-ref-id="3035-490" href="/los-angeles/3035-490/">Los Angeles</a>.</p><p style="">During career mode, the player alternates between playing as Metallica and the opening band, aptly named <em>'Tallica Jr.</em> Players can choose to create their own rock star through the game's Create-a-Rocker editor, or choose from a variety of pre-existing characters (Whom include Guitar Hero staples <a data-ref-id="3005-780" href="/axel-steel/3005-780/">Axel Steel</a>, <a data-ref-id="3005-796" href="/johnny-napalm/3005-796/">Johnny Napalm</a> and <a data-ref-id="3005-763" href="/judy-nails/3005-763/">Judy Nails</a>). Following suit with the previously Neversoft Guitar Hero releases, players can also unlock celebrity rockers including Motorhead's <a data-ref-id="3040-92265" href="/ian-kilmister/3040-92265/">Lemmy Kilmister</a> and Mercyful Fate vocalist <a data-ref-id="3005-10369" href="/king-diamond/3005-10369/">King Diamond</a> (who appears with his trademark cross-bones microphone). When the player plays songs that are not by Metallica - with the exception of 'Ace of Spades' and 'Evil', generic Guitar Hero characters are used.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2020/951908-lemmy_gh.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-951908" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.65277777777778" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:65.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2020/951908-lemmy_gh.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-951908"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2020/951908-lemmy_gh.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2020/951908-lemmy_gh.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Lemmy Kilmister makes an appearance</figcaption></figure><p style="">Aside from the game's career progression style, the in-game interface remains largely unchanged from <a data-ref-id="3030-20673" href="/guitar-hero-world-tour/3030-20673/">Guitar Hero: World Tour</a>. One of the few key differences, however, is a box that goes over your note streak telling you how many stars (out of five) you have earned, similar to the system used in the <a data-ref-id="3025-567" href="/rock-band/3025-567/">Rock Band franchise</a>. In addition to the in-game interface and set list changes, the menus of the game have been given a Metallica make-over, with everything from the start menu sporting Metallica inspired artwork.</p><p style="">The online aspect of Guitar Hero: Metallica remains largely unchanged to <a data-ref-id="3030-20673" href="/guitar-hero-world-tour/3030-20673/">Guitar Hero: World Tour</a>, with the player being able to play in a four-player band, guitar and bass co-op, band vs band matches etc. The only key change resides in the game's guitar-exclusive battle mode, in which a new power up dubbed "Fade to Black" appears. The <a data-ref-id="3015-700" href="/power-up/3015-700/">power-up</a> is most used in sudden death matches, and when used completely blacks out the opposing player's fret board.</p><h2>Features</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13692/1250926-0.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1250926" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.41458333333333" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:41.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13692/1250926-0.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1250926"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/13692/1250926-0.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/13692/1250926-0.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>James Hetfield performing in a motion capture suit</figcaption></figure><p style="">Metallica put on motion-capture suits and did many of their signature moves from their live shows for the game. Among them were bassist <a data-ref-id="3005-9126" href="/rob-trujillo/3005-9126/">Rob Trujillo</a>'s "braid spin" where, during the song "Seek and Destroy", he picks up his bass and spins around in a circle. The game features unlockable videos of the band in the suits, including a scene where <a data-ref-id="3005-7623" href="/lars-ulrich/3005-7623/">Lars Ulrich</a> is playing the band's song "The Shortest Straw" in the suit for the first time.</p><p style="">In addition to the videos of the band in mo-cap suits, the game sports the "Metallifacts" video feature. Metallifacts is a pop-up video style feature that has the virtual band playing the song the player chooses, all the while displaying little known facts and details about the songs they pick. Some songs even feature bootleg performances taped by fans, included on the songs "Creeping Death", "Orion", "For Whom the Bell Tolls", and others.</p><h3>Expert Plus</h3><p style="">A new feature making its debut in Guitar Hero Metallica is the inclusion of Expert Plus, the highest difficulty a player may choose. Only available to Drummers, Expert Plus utilizes a second kickpedal that can be connected to all <i>Guitar Hero World Tour</i> and <i>Band Hero</i> drumkits via the ports on its back.</p><h3>Exportability</h3><p style="">On September 28, 2010, 39 tracks (including all the Metallica tracks except those from Death Magnetic) from Guitar Hero: Metallica will be exportable to Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock.</p><h3>Metallica's Music</h3><p style="">Every Metallica album is represented in the game's setlist.

Return to Hogwarts to help Harry survive a fraught sixth year in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Story</h2><p style="">The game begins in <a href="/london/3035-212/" data-ref-id="3035-212">London</a> where it is revealed that <a href="/severus-snape/3005-4985/" data-ref-id="3005-4985">Snape</a> made the unbreakable vow with Narcissa Malfoy, <a href="/draco-malfoy/3005-6754/" data-ref-id="3005-6754">Draco's</a> mother. Meanwhile, the wizard world is in crisis over the antics of the Death Eaters, <a href="/lord-voldemort/3005-3945/" data-ref-id="3005-3945">Voldemort's</a> followers. Harry spends some time at the <a href="/the-burrow/3035-2386/" data-ref-id="3035-2386">Burrow</a>, where after a broom ride he discovers his affection for <a href="/ginny-weasley/3005-5159/" data-ref-id="3005-5159">Ginny Weasley</a>. Harry starts to think that Draco Malfoy has become a Death Eater, which leads to Harry spying on him on the train ride to <a href="/hogwarts-castle/3035-569/" data-ref-id="3035-569">Hogwarts</a>. Malfoy finds Harry, and paralyzes him until he is rescued by Luna Lovegood. When Harry first enters Hogwarts, he discovers that Snape has become the defence against the dark arts teacher.</p><p style=""> </p><p style="">Harry attends his classes, participates in the dueling club, and plays on the Gryffindor Quidditch team like any other student. His Potions book is second hand, and at one time belonged to the Half Blood Prince. The potions book is modified with different instructions, which result in better potions and the admiration of Slughorn, but the jealousy of <a href="/hermione-granger/3005-4341/" data-ref-id="3005-4341">Hermione.</a></p><p style="">The potions book also contained the spell sectumsempra. When Harry used the spell on Draco, it injured him, guilting Harry to hide the book in the room of retirement. <a href="/ron-weasley/3005-4554/" data-ref-id="3005-4554">Ron Weasley</a> stars to date Lavender Brown, to Hermione's distaste, which leaves Harry caught in the middle of their conflict. Harry meets with Albus Dumbledore to learn more about Voldemort's life, mostly through the use of a pensieve and collected memories. One memory is incomplete however, and Harry is tasked with trying to retrieve it from Professor Slughorn. After one unsuccessful attempt, Harry drinks his Felix Felicis, which he had earned earlier from Slughorn. Harry retrieves the memory, and he and Dumbledore learn that Voldemort has created 6 <a href="/horcrux/3015-3788/" data-ref-id="3015-3788">Horcruxes</a>, and split his soul into 7 pieces to preserve his immortality.</p><p style=""> </p><p style="">Dumbledore tracks down the location of one of the Horcruxes, and he and Harry go to retrieve it. They travel to a <a href="/horcrux-cave/3035-2385/" data-ref-id="3035-2385">cave</a>, and Dumbledore drinks a potion from a cauldron to retrieve what appears to be the Horcrux. The two return to Hogwarts, but when they were gone Malfoy had let the Death Eaters into the castle vis the room of requirement. Dumbledore is cornered and killed by Snape, fulfilling his unbreakable vow. The Death Eaters then flee, while Harry chases after them and attempts to duel Snape. Harry then learns that Snape was the Half Blood Prince. The next day, Harry opens the locket, and discovers that it is not a Horcrux. The real Horcrux was taken by a R.A.B earlier.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Xbox 360/PS3</h3><p style="">On the current generation consoles, the game play mostly involves one of 3 minigames. There is a potion brewing game, where the player must brew a potion as quickly as possible. There is also an on-rails flying game, where the player flies through a series of rings. The third minigame is a dueling game. The player casts spells on the right stick and tries to take away all of their opponents health. There is also an open world, which serves as a connection between cutscenes and minigames. There are also collectible Hogwarts Crests hidden throughout the world which unlock extra characters in the multiplayer dueling.</p><p style=""> </p><h3>Wii</h3><p style="">The Wii release is very similar to the Xbox/PS3 releases, except that the right stick motions are replaced with motion controls for the spell casting.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>22766</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/1824044-box_hpotterathbp.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/1824044-box_hpotterathbp.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/1824044-box_hpotterathbp.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/1824044-box_hpotterathbp.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/1824044-box_hpotterathbp.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1824044-box_hpotterathbp.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/1824044-box_hpotterathbp.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Harry

PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and arcades.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Battle Fantasia is an arcade fighting game from Arc System Works set in a fantasy world later released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles. The game is rendered, for the most part, in 3D, but the gameplay is strictly two-dimensional. It differentiates itself from most other fighting games with its unique art direction, storybook motif, orchestral music and superficial RPG trappings. For an added "RPG touch", the game surfaces numbers which most other fighting games only show in training modes, like the damage values of each hit and total HP.</p><p style="">Predating <a href="/street-fighter-iv/3030-20456/" data-ref-id="3030-20456">Street Fighter IV</a>, Battle Fantasia was called the SF4 before SF4 by some in hindsight.</p><h2>Gameplay and Mechanics</h2><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/103881/2528369-1580047055-23695.png" data-ref-id="1300-2528369" data-ratio="0.76456876456876" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:76.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/103881/2528369-1580047055-23695.png" data-ref-id="1300-2528369"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/10/103881/2528369-1580047055-23695.png"></a></figure><p style="">Battle Fantasia is a five button game with the Appeal, Throw and Heat Up button combinations set to unused buttons by default in the home version for easier execution. Battles play out as they do in most 2D fighting games - deplete the opponent's HP and gain <a href="/super-meter/3015-1013/" data-ref-id="3015-1013">MP</a> by dealing and taking damage.</p><p style="">Buttons A, B, C and D are all used for attacks, the fifth being the GACHI button. GACHI is a mechanic universal to all characters, and it is essentially a parry, usable while standing, crouching and in midair. Depending on the positioning of characters and the direction tapped in conjunction, a GACHI can do a number of things, for example launch the enemy into a wall-bounce and open them up for a follow-up combo.</p><p style="">Tapping left or right twice causes the character to dash or back dash, with the exception of <a href="/donvalve/3005-7882/" data-ref-id="3005-7882">Donvalve</a>, who can only back dash. Coyori is the only character with an <a href="/air-dash/3015-5681/" data-ref-id="3015-5681">air-dash</a>.</p><p style="">All characters can high jump by quickly tapping down before jumping, giving the jump more height and distance.</p><p style="">Heat Up is another mechanic all characters share. Players can activate it when they have at least one full MP bar by pressing A and C at the same time. Effects vary from character to character.</p><h2>Characters</h2><p style="">Battle Fantasia features a cast of twelve playable characters, each with their own storylines, special attacks and unlockable alternate costumes.</p><h3><a href="/marco/3005-9154/" data-ref-id="3005-9154">Marco</a></h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/130096/2366592-marco.png" data-ref-id="1300-2366592" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.2246376811594" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:122.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/130096/2366592-marco.png" data-ref-id="1300-2366592"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/130096/2366592-marco.png"></a></figure><p style="">Marco Van de Land, the nine-year-old son of the legendary hero Silver Knight Dyna. His father disappeared when he was still a baby, but Marco has always tried to live up to his father's legacy and aspires to become like him. One morning he wakes up to find out that his older brother Urs has left home to search for their long lost father. Marco decides to follow in his brother's footsteps and embarks on an adventure with his best friend, a dragon hatchling named Char-Siu.</p><p style=""><b>The future hero, Marco Van de Land!</b></p><p style="">Marco is a straightforward character to use in battle, with special attacks only requiring quarter-circle and dragon punch motions. He wields his father's sword and a small shield, both of which he utilizes in his moves. In Heat Up mode, Marco summons the dragon Char-Siu, who flies behind him for a set period of time and can be commanded to do a variety of attacks. Marco can gain MP by taunting his enemies using the "Appeal" button.</p><p style="">Marco's unlockable costumes are "DynaKid", red armor reminiscent of the <a href="/power-rangers/3025-915/" data-ref-id="3025-915">Power Rangers</a>, and a bright yellow armor set resembling a chick, complete with a beak and eyes.</p><h3><a href="/urs/3005-9153/" data-ref-id="3005-9153">Urs</a></h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/130096/2367760-urs.png" data-ref-id="1300-2367760" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.3634577603143" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:136.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/130096/2367760-urs.png" data-ref-id="1300-2367760"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/130096/2367760-urs.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/130096/2367760-urs.png"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Urs Van de Land, age 17, first son of the great hero Silver Knight Dyna. Urs has been an upstanding member of society ever since childhood, and is always there to defend the weak and the downtrodden. He spends every waking hour honing his skills, thriving to become a greater hero than his revered father. Getting wind of the weird happenings around the world, he decides it's high time he left home in search of his lost father.</p><p style=""><b>Urs Van de Land, a hero for the new age!</b></p><p style="">Urs shares most of his special move inputs with Marco, all of the moves being somewhat comparable as well. He fights using the Basilisk, a weapon resembling a plasma chainsaw stuck to the end of a motorcycle engine complete with exhaust pipes. Urs's special moves hit harder and gain new properties when Heat Up mode is active.</p><h3><a href="/olivia/3005-9155/" data-ref-id="3005-9155">Olivia</a></h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/130096/2368353-olivia.png" data-ref-id="1300-2368353" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.3432055749129" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:134.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/130096/2368353-olivia.png" data-ref-id="1300-2368353"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/130096/2368353-olivia.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/130096/2368353-olivia.png"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Olivia Von Roselia, age 17, is the princess of a small, rose-filled country called Roselia. Her mother, Queen Victoria, was one of the Four Heroes who saved the world from seemingly inevitable destruction years ago. The country shares borders with the two superpowers on the continent, Orgran and Baltana, and as such is subject to a great deal of international intrigue. This led to Olivia being kidnapped and cursed by agents of the neighboring countries as a child, but these hardships only helped her grow stronger. One day Olivia saw that the precious Miracle Rose had started to wither, an ill omen, and left the small kingdom behind in search of answers.</p><p style=""><b>She is the princess who strives to fulfill her noble obligations, the lovely rose, princess Olivia!</b></p><p style="">Olivia uses a staff known as the Heart of Eternity as her weapon, giving her attacks some reach. Her special attacks include a command grab which only does a single point of damage, but leaves opponents open to further attacks. She summons a dole of doves to her side to peck at her enemies when the Heat Up mode is activated.</p><h3><a href="/ashley/3005-9157/" data-ref-id="3005-9157">Ashley</a></h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/130096/2368354-ashley.png" data-ref-id="1300-2368354" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.3911439114391" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:139.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/130096/2368354-ashley.png" data-ref-id="1300-2368354"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/130096/2368354-ashley.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/130096/2368354-ashley.png"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Ashley Loveless is a member of a secret branch of the Roselian Royal Guard, who have been tasked with the ensured safety of the royalty.

When Olivia set out to make sense of the withering Miracle Rose, Ashley followed suit, casting aside his knighthood and becoming her shadow.</p><p style=""><b>He is Ashley Loveless, the Shadow Knight, the one who lives for a love that will never be his!</b></p><p style="">Ashley has a slew of quick and hard-hitting moves, preferring to use his cape and bare hands to do the job. He has a command grab which steals the opponent’s heart, making Ashley glow pink and powering up his next Glance Wing attack, assuming he doesn't get hit before it connects. He can combo and juggle with three variants of Romance Wing, both in midair and on the ground, while in Heat Up mode.</p><h3><a href="/cedric/3005-9156/" data-ref-id="3005-9156">Cedric</a></h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/130096/2368355-cedric.png" data-ref-id="1300-2368355" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.5208747514911" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:152.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/130096/2368355-cedric.png" data-ref-id="1300-2368355"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/130096/2368355-cedric.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/130096/2368355-cedric.png"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Cedric Ward is the son of the Archbishop of Ma Jolle, Prezzi Ward.

Cedric plans on doing so by defeating the sons of the Silver Knight Dyna, Urs and Marco, and sets off on his personal vendetta.</p><p style=""><b>He is Cedric Ward, humble servant of God, out to avenge his family's honor!</b></p><p style="">Cedric is one of the two <a href="/charge-character/3015-7345/" data-ref-id="3015-7345">charge characters</a> in Battle Fantasia, his special moves bearing resemblance to <a href="/guile/3005-266/" data-ref-id="3005-266">Guile</a>’s Flash Kick and Sonic Boom.

He levels up, up to two times, after hitting an opponent three times with a C attack over the course of a single round, changing the properties and damage of his Platina Ball and Torabasa Minore special attacks. Watson can mount an impressive offensive by summoning bear traps, firing Platina Balls and barreling down on his opponents from midair. Heat Up further enhances his Platina Ball, firing two projectiles instead of one, and he can summon a hail of shooting stars to deal massive damage by casting Twinkle Dust three times in succession.</p><h3><a href="/coyori/3005-7883/" data-ref-id="3005-7883">Coyori</a></h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/130096/2368357-coyori.png" data-ref-id="1300-2368357" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.4867617107943" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:148.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/130096/2368357-coyori.png" data-ref-id="1300-2368357"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/130096/2368357-coyori.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/130096/2368357-coyori.png"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">A cat who lives in the eastern land of Sumerami.

Coyori as the new poster girl, the café becomes an instant hit, drawing the attention of adventurers all over the world.</p><p style=""><b>One day, however, Coyori Café was visited by an unexpected guest...</b></p><p style="">Coyori is a relentless rush-down character with nine special attacks and fast pokes to keep her opponents on the defensive. She is the only character with an air-dash, giving her extra mobility and opportunities for fast overhead attacks with which to catch people off guard. The Super Special Move Cat Storm gets more vicious if the player mashes attack buttons while she claws away at her enemy. Heat Up mode changes the properties of her attacks, notably her super Crazy Cat Dance gets an added wall-bounce at the end.</p><h3><a href="/freed/3005-7922/" data-ref-id="3005-7922">Freed</a></h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/130096/2368358-freed.png" data-ref-id="1300-2368358" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.2279005524862" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:122.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/130096/2368358-freed.png" data-ref-id="1300-2368358"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/130096/2368358-freed.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/130096/2368358-freed.png"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Freed Valez, the daredevil, one-armed captain of the flying ship Gran Seven.

Starting fresh, Rebellion made several changes to the gameplay and story. The setting became the Soviet Union in 1986, the engine changed to a proprietary one, the co-op and tiling system ideas were scrapped, and they decided to focus more on Dick Marcinko's personality and kill-moves. The name was shortened to simply <i>"Rogue Warrior"</i> and <a href="/mickey-rourke/3040-92281/" data-ref-id="3040-92281">Mickey Rourke</a> was announced as the voice of Dick Marcinko.</p><h2>Plot</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/961932-ivan_throat_rev4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-961932" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/961932-ivan_throat_rev4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-961932"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/26/961932-ivan_throat_rev4.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/26/961932-ivan_throat_rev4.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Eliminate all opposition.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The game starts off in North Korea in 1986. <a href="/dick-marcinko/3005-10492/" data-ref-id="3005-10492">Dick Marcinko</a> (voiced by <a href="/mickey-rourke/3040-92281/" data-ref-id="3040-92281">Mickey Rourke</a>) is sent via a helicopter to retrieve some intel on ballistic missiles. In typical 80's movies fashion, all of Dick's partners are ambushed and killed upon arrival. During the time Dick is trying to disable the missiles, North and South Korea declare war on each other which leaves Dick in the middle of a war zone. Upon escaping, he is sent to Russia to disable even more ballistic missiles the Koreans managed to smuggle out of the country. Dick's overall mission is to prevent the ballistic missiles from launching and eliminate all opposition.</p><p style="">The story is embellished from <a

rating of 28/100. Most reviews points out the $60 price tag as the biggest flaw of the game, since its content simply isn't on par with similar games on the market.</p><p style="">GameZone's Natalie Romano gave the game a 2/10 and wrote:</p><blockquote><p style="">"A very disappointing game from start to finish, Rogue Warrior is a game that brings nothing new to the genre nor does it make for a fun first-person shooter worth the money. Simply put, this isn’t just an awful shooter but it’s also a terrible game. Sorry but this is one hero we would like to leave behind."</p></blockquote><p style="">GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd gave the game a 2/10 and wrote:</p><blockquote><p style="">"This dreadfully boring, expletive-filled, extremely short shooter is an absolute rip-off."</p></blockquote><p style="">Game reviewers' scores tend to lie very close to each other when a game is either very good or very bad, with the latter seeming to be the case in this instance.</p><h2>PC System Requirements</h2><h3>Minimum System Requirements</h3><ul><li>Operating System: Windows XP/Vista</li><li>Processor: Pentium 4 @ 3.4 GHz or Equivalent</li><li>Memory: 1 GB (2 GB for Vista)</li><li>Video Memory: 256 MB (NVIDIA GeForce 7900/ATI Radeon X1800)</li><li>Sound Card: DirectX Compatible</li><li>Other: DirectX: 9.0c, Keyboard and Mouse, DVD Rom Drive</li></ul><h3>Recommended System Requirements</h3><ul><li>OS: Windows XP/Vista</li><li>Processor: Intel Core 2 DUO E6400 (2.13 GHz) or AMD Athlon Equivalent</li><li>Memory: 2 GB</li><li>Video Memory: 512 MB (NVIDIA GeForce 8800/ATI HD2900)</li><li>Sound Card: DirectX Compatible</li><li>Other: DirectX: 9.0c or 10, Keyboard and Mouse, DVD Rom Drive</li></ul>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>22858</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/1/13158/1208746-gb.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/13158/1208746-gb.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/1/13158/1208746-gb.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/13158/1208746-gb.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/13158/1208746-gb.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/13158/1208746-gb.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/1/13158/1208746-gb.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Rogue Warrior]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>15</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-16/]]></api_detail_url><id>16</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: M]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-37/]]></api_detail_url><id>37</id><name><![CDATA[PEGI: 18+]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2009-12-01 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/rogue-warrior/3030-22858/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-22866/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-08-02 23:30:43</date_added><date_last_updated>2013-05-10 13:47:55</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[TimeO is a an action adventure game about two New York City urban explorers who discover an entrance to a parallel world in which they must battle to survive encounters with armies of hostile robots and malevolent, ambulatory buildings.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<p style="">This game originally entered development as an unofficial videogame tie-in to the <a href="http://www.screened.com/ghostbusters/16-172703/" rel="nofollow"><i>Ghostbusters</i></a> franchise, but developer ZootFly ran into unexpected trouble when trying to acquire the license, because an official game by a different developer, <a href="/ghostbusters-the-video-game/3030-20688/" data-ref-id="3030-20688"><i>Ghostbusters: The Video Game</i></a>, was secretly in the works.

It seems likely that <i>TimeO</i> will have a focus on co-operation between the two New Yorkers as they fight armies of mechanical spiders and tiny flying eyes, with larger segments of the war machine serving as bosses in the form of entire buildings come to life.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>22866</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/0/3699/471392-timeo_logo.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3699/471392-timeo_logo.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/0/3699/471392-timeo_logo.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3699/471392-timeo_logo.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/3699/471392-timeo_logo.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3699/471392-timeo_logo.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/0/3699/471392-timeo_logo.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[TimeO]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating/><original_release_date/><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/timeo/3030-22866/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed 2

In the continuation of the saga, Assassin's Creed II takes place in <a data-ref-id="3035-1451" href="/italy/3035-1451/">Italy</a> in the year 1476.

Rumors of Assassin's Creed II's existence began circulating in mid-2008, but it was officially confirmed by way of a cryptic teaser-trailer on April 6th 2009. Ubisoft announced at their press conference during <a data-ref-id="3015-3168" href="/e3/3015-3168/">E3</a> that Assassin's Creed II is slated for release on November 17th 2009.

This machine lets him relive past experiences as his ancestors through genetic memory. In the first game you played as Altaïr. The narrative then follows the exploits of Ezio, an Italian noble who is betrayed by the rival ruling families of Italy. Educated in poetry, and art, as well as trained in the art of swordplay and war, Ezio is both a scholar and a warrior. He is not, however, an assassin, although he finds himself moving down that path as he is faced with betrayal and murder.</p><p style="">Over the arc of the story, many historical figures will find their way into the narrative, including the <a data-ref-id="3005-10830" href="/lorenzo-de-medici/3005-10830/">Medici</a>, <a data-ref-id="3005-3202" href="/leonardo-da-vinci/3005-3202/">Leonardo Da Vinci</a> (his friend and supporter), and <a data-ref-id="3005-10829" href="/niccolo-machiavelli/3005-10829/">Machiavelli</a>.

He hails from Florence, Italy and has blood ties to Altair, as well as Desmond Miles, the modern-day protagonist in the first game. Assassin's Creed II is set in 1476 in Italy, and similar to the original game, the second iteration of the series will feature an over world, and will include locations such as Saint Mark's Basilica Cathedral, The Grand Canal, Rialto Bridge, and Da Vinci's Workshop. The city states of <a data-ref-id="3035-2112" href="/florence/3035-2112/">Florence</a>, <a data-ref-id="3035-1825" href="/venice-italy/3035-1825/">Venice</a>, Romagna, and <a data-ref-id="3035-2113" href="/tuscany/3035-2113/">Tuscany</a> are the setting of Ezio's journey.</p><p style="">Unlike the first game where Altaïr was more of a lone soldier, Ezio this time has a sort of family helping him out. That is to say you can recruit people, or you can use family members placed on the streets, and have them be diversions or hide dead bodies. They can even help you out while fighting, and will join, when they think it's necessary. Your allies are into 3 guilds you will ally with through the game, The Mercenaries Guild, The Thieves Guild and Courtestans. The mercenaries are used for battle, the courtesans for distraction and the thieves for both.</p><p style="">The structure from Assassin's Creed where you would go out investigate, kill your target and return back to your master has been scrapped. You can now take on the missions in different ways. There are 15 individual mission types this time, however, the developers can combine the mission types all into one, creating a completely new way you must play. At E3, the developers stated that they had roughly 200 unique mission types. Also the AI is now more ruthless. It can remember you, and will investigate if it thinks it knows you. To make it a little more difficult on enemy guards, however, players have the option of buying different outfits to disguise themselves. Various capes and dyes will also help you pull off different looks, making it that much harder for the AI to find you.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1202198-double_assassination.png" data-ref-id="1300-1202198" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1202198-double_assassination.png" data-ref-id="1300-1202198"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3661/1202198-double_assassination.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3661/1202198-double_assassination.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Thanks to Leonardo, Ezio uses TWO hidden blades</figcaption></figure><p style="">Ezio, unlike Altair, wields dual <a data-ref-id="3055-962" href="/hidden-blade/3055-962/">hidden blades</a>, a new and useful tool. Another new addition is the <a data-ref-id="3015-2972" href="/disarm/3015-2972/">disarm</a> technique; Ezio can disarm an enemy and take the newly acquired weapon as his own (until the weapon is dropped by selecting a weapon carried in the inventory). This is especially useful for the better armored and skilled blocker opponents. Strong enemies are also capable of disarming Ezio by knocking weapons out of his hand; the weapon will fall to the ground and can be picked up again, but if it is left forgotten Ezio must return to his Villa's war room to reequip the same weapon. He also has a wrist gun hidden under his sleeve where his double hidden blades are, and can obtain and use several different weapons from shops. Available weapons include: <a data-ref-id="3055-1" href="/sword/3055-1/">swords</a>, <a data-ref-id="3055-1306" href="/dagger/3055-1306/">daggers</a>, <a data-ref-id="3055-573" href="/spear/3055-573/">spears</a> (after disarming an opponent), <a data-ref-id="3055-729" href="/war-hammer/3055-729/">war hammers</a>, <a data-ref-id="3055-2214" href="/battle-axe/3055-2214/">battle axes</a>, and <a data-ref-id="3055-724" href="/mace/3055-724/">maces</a>. You may also use weapons like brooms gained from citizens. These all tie in to the updated combat mechanic in the game, which blends elements of the system from the first game, such as counters and parries, and implements them in the more fluid, realistic combat system of Assassins Creed II.</p><p style="">The developers aim to create a system that makes Ezio feel more like an assassin than a Warrior, encouraging the use of quick take downs over prolonged engagements with guards. To reinforce this feeling, Ezio will for the most part no longer carry any set weapon issued to him by a superior. The player can buy and upgrade weapons and items at shops, letting Ezio keep them constantly in his inventory and war room storage. The enemies Ezio will face have also been expanded upon so that now he will be forced to contend with both heavily armored guards, spear soldiers, swordsmen, and lightly armored foes wielding lighter weapons.</p><p style="">Ezio's <a data-ref-id="3015-130" href="/health/3015-130/">health</a> no longer regenerates to the same extent, and although syncing will restore some health, players must consult street doctors or use medicine for more serious wounds. Hiding spots are no longer a guaranteed escape, as there is a new AI class-type named the seeker who can see through hiding spots. He can poke Ezio with his spear to draw him out of cover. You may still counter his attacks while inside cover. Assassin's Creed II also adds the ability to swim, which proves useful in the canals of Venice. Another notable ability is being able to assassinate enemies from hiding spots, such as hay bails.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3439/948875-ac2_teaser_detail_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-948875" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.78217821782178" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:78.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3439/948875-ac2_teaser_detail_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-948875"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3439/948875-ac2_teaser_detail_2.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3439/948875-ac2_teaser_detail_2.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Re-Worked Assassin Symbol</figcaption></figure><p style="">Other new features include a <a data-ref-id="3015-92" href="/daynight-cycle/3015-92/">day and night cycle</a> and a <a data-ref-id="3015-2973" href="/notoriety-system/3015-2973/">notoriety system</a> in which Ezio will become recognized as he takes on more quests in each town; higher notoriety will result in civilians and guards becoming increasingly wary of the player's movements. This level of notoriety will be set within each city, so that while the player may be completely unknown in some cities, he may be infamous in others. The player may take on quests to bribe or kill informants and remove wanted posters in order to decrease his notoriety level, however some capes drop your notoriety in some cites. There are also many hidden items scattered throughout the world like the first Assassin's Creed. These include Gold Coins, Flags and mini statues. This time, however, collecting these items will unlock concrete bonuses: new items and rewards for players instead of just gamerpoints.</p><p style="">There are fifteen mission types in Assassin's Creed II, a large increase over the number in the original, as there are now over 200 missions in Assassin's Creed II. Also changed is the fact that, upon entering the city, the player will not be forced to repeat the same side quests, in the same order, for each assassination, as they did in the first game. However, they have removed the passive quests of the older missions like eavesdropping or pick pocketing. Different mission types may be linked in a single quest: a robbery may turn into a chase, which may then turn into an assassination.</p><p style="">Another feature is an all new <a data-ref-id="3015-2425" href="/economy/3015-2425/">economic system</a>. Ezio is a rich nobleman and that's where the system comes into play. Along with the ability to pick-pocket people in the game to take their money, you can use that money to buy weapons and ammunition. <a data-ref-id="3055-574" href="/armor/3055-574/">Armor</a> is available for purchase, as well as clothing dye to customize Ezio's outfit. You can also use the money to hire thieves and street hookers, if you didn't become friends with them before, for assistance in an assassination plot. To Increase your economic, you spend money to renovate Monteriggionni, giving you increased income per 20 minutes.</p><p style="">Desmond Miles is given less screen time but more abilities than in the first game. In the first game, Desmond could only walk and talk, but in this sequel he participates in a few more dynamic, action-oriented sequences.</p><h3>Story</h3><p style="">The story starts with <a data-ref-id="3005-305" href="/desmond-miles/3005-305/">Desmond</a> escaping from <a data-ref-id="3015-2653" href="/abstergo-industries/3015-2653/">Abstergo</a> with <a data-ref-id="3005-2566" href="/lucy-stillman/3005-2566/">Lucy</a> after viewing a common link between him and <a data-ref-id="3005-13227" href="/subject-16/3005-13227/">subject 16</a>, that common link is <a data-ref-id="3005-10269" href="/ezio-auditore-da-firenze/3005-10269/">Ezio Auditore</a>, a Renaissance <a data-ref-id="3015-1321" href="/assassin/3015-1321/">Assassin</a>.

There has been an ancient struggle caused by the greed for an isolated source of energy, between the industrial Atherns and the spiritually inclined Litherns. This struggle was caused by the imprisonment of the Litherns and the ensuing genocide of the Atherns, an apocalyptic event called The Rift. Lex is the only hope of Hellayem, he is the only half breed of these two oppositions and the only one who can exists in both the realms simultaneously.

This includes being able to raise the dead to do his killing for him and a Berserker mode that sends him into an uncontrollable rampage.</p><h3>Splatter Kills</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19306/1499574-4481571025_a905ba259a_b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1499574" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="960" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 960px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19306/1499574-4481571025_a905ba259a_b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1499574"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/19306/1499574-4481571025_a905ba259a_b.jpg"></a><figcaption>An example of a "splatter kill."</figcaption></figure><p style="">After grabbing an enemy, Rick will have the option of performing a gory "splatter kill" that will cause body parts to fly off enemies, which he can then use against other enemies.

Moving away from the animation-styled look of those games, BottleRocket decided to use the Gamebryo engine (made popular with <a href="/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/3030-20238/" data-ref-id="3030-20238">Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a> and <a href="/warhammer-online-age-of-reckoning/3030-20666/" data-ref-id="3030-20666">Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning</a>) in order to create their world. Rick appears bulkier than in any of the previous Splatterhouse games, while wearing a more skull-like mask draws attention away from looking like Friday the 13th horror icon Jason Voorhees as he did in the first three games. Any damage that Rick takes will show up physically on his character model, and the engine being used offers real-time health regeneration to be shown as muscles, veins, and limbs growing back onto Rick. Splatterhouse also takes advantage of the <a href="/havok-physics/3015-502/" data-ref-id="3015-502">Havok physics engine</a>, allowing for destructible environments and enemies.</p><p style="">Concept art, promotional art, and advertising art have been handled by <a href="/simon-bisley/3040-30395/" data-ref-id="3040-30395">Simon Bisley</a>, who is known for his work with the magazine <i>2,000AD</i>.</p><h2>Nods to Franchise History</h2><p style="">Certain elements, characters, enemies, and more have been included in Splatterhouse to pay tribute to the original games. A small list of these include:</p><ul><li>Robo-Ape, Dr. West's robotic simian bodyguard (boss character)</li><li>Biggy Man (boss character known for having two chainsaws in place of his hands)</li><li>Clawface (boss character known for the huge pus sacks on his face)</li><li>2x4s, shotguns, and cleavers (weapons in the original games)</li><li>Dr. West's estate (level)</li></ul><h2>Development</h2><p style="">On February 9th, 2009, Namco Bandai announced that Splatterhouse will have a new developer. <a href="/bottlerocket-entertainment/3010-6406/" data-ref-id="3010-6406">BottleRocket</a> will no longer be involved in the project. Initial rumors speculated that <a href="/namco-bandai-games-inc/3010-382/" data-ref-id="3010-382">Namco Bandai Games</a> themselves had taken over the development after finishing work on Afro Samurai, but the official statement issued by Namco Bandai on February 9th said:</p><blockquote><p style="">"We have decided to part ways with BottleRocket Entertainment but we are committed to bringing Splatterhouse to the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 later this year. At this time, we are not ready to discuss specific development details about the game and wish BottleRocket the best of luck in their future endeavors."</p></blockquote><p style="">On February 12th, 2009, <a href="http://kotaku.com/5152734/ditched-splatterhouse-developers-wish-namco-the-best" rel="nofollow">popular website Kotaku.com reported</a> that Namco Bandai Games, the in-house developers behind Afro Samurai, would in fact be taking over the reins of the Splatterhouse project. Namco Bandai also stated:</p><blockquote><p style="">"BottleRocket wishes Namco the best in completing their project. The BottleRocket development team is looking forward to turning their attention to a new project soon to be announced."</p></blockquote><p style="">Shortly after this announcement, it was revealed that Namco Bandai hired on several members from the original BottleRocket development team after BottleRocket shut its doors.</p><p style="">Due to the shift in development teams, however, the original April 28th, 2009 release date has been pushed back into 2010. After many delays, the game has finally settled on an October 26th, 2010 release date, one week before Halloween.</p><p style="">Shortly after BottleRocket closed its doors, a user by the name of "dulledblade" started advertising that he was selling pre-release beta versions of Splatterhouse for $675 a copy. It has never been confirmed who the individual is or whether he worked for BottleRocket.</p><p style="">On April 9th, it was announced that Namco Bandai would be offering the original trilogy of Splatterhouse games as <a href="/unlockables/3015-1414/" data-ref-id="3015-1414">unlockables</a> in the new Splatterhouse. There is no confirmation on how those will be unlocked.</p><p style="">At <a href="/e3-2010/3015-4529/" data-ref-id="3015-4529">E3 2010</a>, a trailer was shown off giving a "Fall 2010" release date at the end. It showed some of the story portions, as well as a lot of gameplay. 2D side-scrolling was shown in the trailer, as well as more of the combat and gore that the franchise is known for. The graphics have been enhanced slightly, adding a bold outline to the outer edges of character models and the likes to make them stand out more.</p><p style="">At <a href="/pax-prime-2010/3015-5375/" data-ref-id="3015-5375">PAX 2010</a>, it was announced that a firm release date of November 23th, 2010 had been set.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p style="">Popular prog-metal band Mastodon was confirmed as performing the entire soundtrack for the demo shown at the 2009 New York Comic Convention. Reporters were told that lead character Rick Taylor would wear a Mastodon t-shirt before he wears the Terror Mask and becomes the "monster" that he is throughout the game. With the shift in developers, this idea was thrown out and a new soundtrack.</p><p style="">The official Splatterhouse website has confirmed that the game's soundtrack will include several thrash, death and grindcore bands, as well as original music from songwriter/composer <a href="/howard-drossin/3040-29966/" data-ref-id="3040-29966">Howard Drossin</a>. Confirmed bands for the <a href="/licensed-soundtrack/3015-433/" data-ref-id="3015-433">licensed soundtrack</a> are:</p><ul><li><b>Five Finger Death Punch</b></li><li><b>The Haunted</b></li><li><b>Terrorizer</b></li><li><b>Mastodon</b></li><li><b>ASG</b></li><li><b>The Accused</b></li><li><b>Municipal Waste</b></li><li><b>Lamb of God</b></li><li><b>Highonfire</b></li><li><b>The Cavalera Conspiracy</b></li><li><b>Goatwhore</b></li><li><b>Mutant Supremacy</b></li></ul>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>22968</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/1886626-box_shouse.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/1886626-box_shouse.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/1886626-box_shouse.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/1886626-box_shouse.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/1886626-box_shouse.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1886626-box_shouse.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/1886626-box_shouse.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Splatterhouse]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>12</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-16/]]></api_detail_url><id>16</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: M]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-37/]]></api_detail_url><id>37</id><name><![CDATA[PEGI: 18+]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2010-11-23 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/splatterhouse/3030-22968/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-23022/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-08-05 17:18:32</date_added><date_last_updated>2011-09-26 20:57:16</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[Heat was a video game coming to, "next generation platforms," based on the movie of the same name.

It was released on Xbox 360, Playstation 3 and PC in October 2009 to coincide with the movie release of Saw VI. SAW was originally developed by <a data-ref-id="3010-6285" href="/brash-entertainment/3010-6285/" slug="brash-entertainment">Brash Entertainment</a>, but when Brash ceased operations, <a data-ref-id="3010-992" href="/konami-digital-entertainment-co-ltd/3010-992/" slug="konami-digital-entertainment-co-ltd">Konami</a> picked up the publishing rights. The development duties were handed over to <a data-ref-id="3010-1865" href="/zombie-inc/3010-1865/" slug="zombie-inc">Zombie Inc</a>.</p><p style="">The story of SAW takes place between the first two films of the franchise and revolves around <a data-ref-id="3005-11383" href="/detective-david-tapp/3005-11383/" slug="detective-david-tapp">Detective David Tapp</a> (the character portrayed by Danny Glover in the first SAW film) and his kidnapping by " The Jigsaw Killer". Tapp is awakened in The Asylum and has no choice but to work his way through several of Jigsaw's traps containing people who are in some way connected to Tapp. It has been said by the developer that Tapp will encounter many people throughout the asylum, some of which will be friendly and try to help the detective, and some who might attempt to kill him.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">SAW runs on Epic's Unreal Engine 3. The game tries to capture the essence and feel of a new SAW movie, rather than just being a game based on a previous story. The developers have mined the films for ideas and have come back with a plethora of ideas, and the game is essentially divided into two sections that revolve around those ideas.</p><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13692/1183853-sawgame_2009_11_01_02_04_06_83.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1183853" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13692/1183853-sawgame_2009_11_01_02_04_06_83.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1183853"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/13692/1183853-sawgame_2009_11_01_02_04_06_83.jpg"></a><figcaption>One of Jigsaw's many death traps</figcaption></figure><p style="">The first part of the game is the exploration. The game takes place in a slightly-open asylum, and as Detective Tapp, the player must run around, finding their way between goals, avoiding deadly traps along the way. Traps include things like shotgun traps, which result in instant death, and rooms filled with gas or explosives that the player must solve a puzzle to escape. Puzzle solving plays a large part in the game when it comes to unlocking doors. Doors feature a variety of puzzles, such as a gear-placing task and a tumbler-matching puzzle, which must be solved for the door to be opened. Gears aren't unlimited, and must be found in events, such as sticking your hand into a toilet filled with syringes to fish one out for later use.</p><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13692/1183872-sawgame_2009_11_01_17_33_42_42.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1183872" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13692/1183872-sawgame_2009_11_01_17_33_42_42.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1183872"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/13692/1183872-sawgame_2009_11_01_17_33_42_42.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/13692/1183872-sawgame_2009_11_01_17_33_42_42.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Exploration plays a big part in the game</figcaption></figure><p style="">In addition, detective Tapp has been fitted with a collar that is covered in shotgun shells. When he gets to close to someone else who has a similar collar on, he must kill them or else both of them will die. The combat in Saw is rather basic. It's possible to use such weapons as mannequin arms, lamps, baseball bats, syringes and scalpels to take down enemies, and even to take them down with a single hit. However, weapons have life to them and can break from overuse. Fighting itself is a bit slow and clunky, and if you get hit, you may be unable to recover as the enemy continues to beat you, which may result in some rather frustrating deaths. Combat doesn't play a heavy part in the gameplay, and finding other victims of Jigsaw is a bit rare. Even when they are found, they tend to be defeated rather quickly, simply acting as slight problems rather than full danger.</p><p style="">The second part of the game is the death traps that Jigsaw is so known for. The game essentially breaks it up to where the detective must save each person from an elaborate contraption by solving another puzzle. The puzzles themselves are strangely simple and none too grisly, though failing them will result in a gory and outrageous death for the person involved. Essentially the game's boss battles, these are important in terms of the games story, as well as advancing the plot and allowing the detective entry into new areas.</p><h2>Characters</h2><h3>Main Characters</h3><table class="t-editor with-border full-width"><tbody><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td><a data-ref-id="3005-11383" href="/detective-david-tapp/3005-11383/" slug="detective-david-tapp">Detective David Tapp</a></td><td>The protagonist of the game.

The fire at Blackgate forces authorities to transfer the Blackgate prisoners to Arkham Asylum.

The Joker taunts Batman for falling into his trap and flees deeper into the asylum, as the Blackgate prisoners, who are revealed to be in collusion with Joker, are freed from their cells.</p><p style="">As Batman travels further through the facility, he finds that <a href="/mr-zsasz/3005-10486/" data-ref-id="3005-10486">Victor Zsasz</a> has escaped confinement and taken a guard hostage. Batman uses stealth to knock out Zsasz without causing collateral damage. A bit later, Batman hears about Arkham guard <a href="/frank-boles/3005-15240/" data-ref-id="3005-15240">Frank Boles</a>, who has been working for the Joker, and has now helped him escape. Within the observation room, Batman picks up a flask of alcohol dropped by Boles and syncs his cowl vision to detect trace amounts of alcohol in the air from Boles' breath. His trail leads Batman back to the entrance of Intensive Care, where he find Boles has been murdered, his corpse left on a cot upright with green paint around his mouth, and a sign on his chest reading, "Dead End." Immediately after, a familiar voice comes over Batman's earpiece in the form of <a href="/the-riddler/3005-2948/" data-ref-id="3005-2948">the Riddler</a>, who, though not physically present at the Asylum, had previously set-up a little game in the Asylum and the surrounding island, should you choose to accept it. This opens up "The Riddler's Challenge" section of the game, where the player may follow clues in each area to discover hidden trophies, biographies, audio logs, etc. Batman immediately starts a trace program and continues after the Joker.</p><p style="">Batman soon hears that the Joker claims to have placed bombs throughout the city, and is threatening to detonate these bombs if anyone outside Arkham Island tries to enter. Also, he discovers that Joker has abducted Commissioner Gordon, and instructed Harley to hold him as a prisoner.</p><p style="">Before Batman can reach the room where Harley is keeping Gordon, he is confronted by <a href="/scarecrow/3005-4907/" data-ref-id="3005-4907">Scarecrow</a>, who uses his fear gas to make Batman believe that Gordon was killed. He also hallucinates the bodies of Thomas and Martha Wayne, his dead parents, inside of body bags in a morgue. As Batman exits the room, he finds himself inside a nightmarish world along with Scarecrow, who has taken on a monstrous, gigantic form. Batman defeats Scarecrow, which allows him to escape the drug induced vision and back to reality. He then locates and disables Harley Quinn, frees Gordon, and barely survives a surprise encounter with <a href="/bane/3005-6674/" data-ref-id="3005-6674">Bane</a> by remotely ordering the Batmobile to run him over.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1113534-t_batmanaa_tstr_h264_8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1113534" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1113534-t_batmanaa_tstr_h264_8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1113534"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/669/1113534-t_batmanaa_tstr_h264_8.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/669/1113534-t_batmanaa_tstr_h264_8.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Batman looking out over the asylum.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Batman heads to a secondary <a href="/">Batcave</a> he built on the island some time ago to analyze data provided by <a href="/oracle/3005-10356/" data-ref-id="3005-10356">Oracle</a> on <a href="/">Dr. Penelope Young</a>, one of the chief architects of the Titan program. Young was experimenting on prisoners using a heavily-modified form of Venom, the drug that gives Bane his power, in order to increase the toxin’s potency and can transform anyone similarly to the way it effects Bane, though stripping away their intelligence, leaving them a mindless, aggressive monster. Batman leaves for Arkham Mansion to find Dr. Young, who had returned there with <a href="/">Aaron Cash</a> to recover her research notes.</p><p style="">After entering the mansion, Batman learns from Oracle that funding received by Young came from the Joker, but Young attempted to back out of the deal—which caused Joker to formulate his plan to break <i>into</i> Arkham and steal the Titan formula. Batman reaches Young’s office, but the doctor has already been captured. By isolating her recent fingerprints, the Dark Knight is able to track Young to a library. He finds her research notes hidden in a book and destroys them, then continues to track the doctor to warden <a href="/">Sharp</a>’s office.</p><p style="">Young is being held prisoner by a newly re-escaped Mr. Zsasz, but Batman successfully knocks him out and frees Young. Penelope informs Batman that she worked out of a lab in the Botanical Gardens, but is promptly killed by a booby trap left by the Joker. Batman uses a piece of Sharp’s cane to bypass the security doors and enter the cell block. He meets an imprisoned <a href="/poison-ivy/3005-5726/" data-ref-id="3005-5726">Poison Ivy</a>, who is deeply distraught over the “pain” she feels from the local plants, which are being trampled and burned as the prisoners run wild across the island. Batman rescues warden Sharp and tracks down Harley Quinn, dispatching her guards and locking her in an isolation cell.</p><p style="">The Dark Knight uses Quinn’s fingerprints to locate the Titan lab in the Botanical Gardens. He confronts the Joker and engages in a fierce battle with a pair of Joker’s thugs injected with Titan. Batman succeeds in destroying the production facility, however, and seeks out Ivy to help create an antidote for the Titan.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4080/1118063-batman_arkham_asylum_poison_ivy_trailer_5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1118063" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.56210691823899" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4080/1118063-batman_arkham_asylum_poison_ivy_trailer_5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1118063"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4080/1118063-batman_arkham_asylum_poison_ivy_trailer_5.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4080/1118063-batman_arkham_asylum_poison_ivy_trailer_5.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Poison Ivy</figcaption></figure><p style="">Ivy, having been released from her cell by Quinn, sends Batman to Killer Croc’s lair to collect spore samples. While Batman is in transit, Joker injects Ivy with Titan, causing her plants to wreak havoc throughout the island. After meeting Cash in Arkham Mansion to determine the location of Croc’s lair, Batman returns to Intensive Treatment and is once again attacked by Scarecrow. The Dark Knight resists the evil doctor’s toxin long enough to enter Croc’s lair, where the rabid criminal attacks Scarecrow and drags him into the sewers.</p><p style="">Batman journeys through Croc’s lair and gathers spore samples, all the while avoiding Croc’s repeated attacks. Once he has collected enough samples, Batman makes his escape by blowing up a section of the floor and plunging Killer Croc into the bowels of Arkham. Batman returns to the Batcave to formulate the Titan antidote, but is forced the leave prematurely after the cave is attacked by Ivy’s mutated plants. The World’s Greatest Detective heads back to the Botanical Gardens for a final confrontation with Ivy.</p><p style="">On his way through the sewers, Batman learns that Joker is filling the reservoir with Titan and plans to pump it into the Gotham River, contaminating the city’s water supply and transforming most of Gotham City's residents into vicious Titan mutants. Batman succeeds in shutting down the pumps that control the water flow and continues to the gardens to take care of Ivy. The deranged villainess confronts Batman from within a giant, carnivorous plant. Eventually, the Dark Knight succeeds in blasting Ivy out of her pod and injecting her with the Titan antidote, causing the plants that have infected the island to wither and die.</p><p style="">With only one loose end left to tie, Batman is invited by Joker to his “party,” where Batman is set to be the guest of honour. After defeating a number of Joker’s thugs, the Clown Prince of Crime reveals that he has again captured Commissioner Gordon. He tries to shoot Gordon with a Titan-filled dart, but Batman dives in front of the bolt and takes it himself. Despite the Joker's encouragement to turn into a monster, Batman manages to fight off the transformation through sheer force of will. Joker, frustrated that his perfect night has been ruined by Batman, injects <i>himself</i> with Titan, transforming into a pale monstrosity with razor-sharp claws and a wicked green Mohawk.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5234/1656984-84871952_3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1656984" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5234/1656984-84871952_3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1656984"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5234/1656984-84871952_3.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5234/1656984-84871952_3.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Titan Joker fighting Batman near the end of the game.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The Joker brings Batman and Gordon to the roof, where they battle in an electrified combat ring. Batman uses the last of the antidote on himself, leaving Joker in his transformed state and forcing them to do battle mano-a-mano. Eventually, Batman succeeds in eliminating the Joker with an explosive punch to the face, leaving the insane criminal to be carted away by Arkham security (after the transformation wore off, that is) and put back in his cell. As the night ends, the Titan-infused inmates begin to return to normal and the escaped prisoners are locked up. Gordon is reunited with his daughter via radio and thanks Batman for his service to the city. The Dark Knight climbs into the Batwing and flies off into the night, ready to face whatever evils Gotham throws his way.</p><p style="">A post-credit shot features a box of Titan floating in the bay, where the hand of either Bane, Scarecrow, or Killer Croc reaches up from the water and grasps the box.</p><h2><b>Gameplay</b></h2><p style=""><i>Batman: Arkham Asylum</i>'s gameplay focuses on the three key concepts that the title character is most famous for: his prowess in hand-to-hand melee combat, silent elimination of enemies from the shadows, and genius skills in investigation, which have earned him the title "the world's greatest detective."</p><h3>FreeFlow Combat</h3><p style="">The combat in the game relies on players combining different movements and attacks to help them take down a small and large groups of enemies in a free flowing and fluid combo system that allows players to pick and choose between targets at will. For example, stunning an enemy by swiping them in the face with Batman's cape will give the player time to counter an incoming attack from another enemy, which may result in Batman delivering a takedown maneuver with some gymnastic style as he moves to deal with the next enemy. Combining attacks, stuns and counters allows players some diversity in how they handle multiple enemies and combat in general.</p><p style="">Additionally, the combat contains some RPG elements in the form of experience points which are gathered by fighting and performing various combos. Accumulating experience points helps towards upgrading Batman's arsenal of gadgets and obtaining more advanced fighting techniques. There is a circular meter running underneath the health bar which fills up as the player gains experience points, so players are aware how close they are to their next opportunity to level-up. The health bar appears only during combat and will replenish itself whenever you gain experience points; nearly all enemy encounters will reward enough XP at the end of the fight to fully replenish Batman's health, but there are a very small amount of environmental hazards that can damage Batman and then leave him with no immediate way to regain his health.</p><h3>Invisible Predator</h3><p style="">A <a href="/stealth/3015-24/" data-ref-id="3015-24">stealth</a> gameplay mechanic is featured in certain sections of the game, but the player is encouraged to do more than simply avoid contact with enemies. The stealth gameplay has been dubbed "predatory" gameplay, where the player's goal is to intimidate and strike fear into their enemies, to hunt them from the shadows rather than merely hiding from them as in the traditional stealth genre. Players may eliminate enemies using silent takedowns, explosions, and environmental fixtures such as gargoyles, fragile walls and glass ceilings.</p><p style="">Players can use the bodies of enemies or their cries for help to attract the attention of other enemies in the area (or, later in the game, special collars that create an alarm as soon as an enemy is unconscious). This can allow Batman to slip through a doorway without being noticed, or stalk and lay a trap for enemies that have come to inspect a fallen comrade's body .</p><h3><a href="/detective-mode/3015-6244/" data-ref-id="3015-6244"><b>Detective Mode</b></a></h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62561/1181312-batman2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1181312" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62561/1181312-batman2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1181312"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62561/1181312-batman2.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62561/1181312-batman2.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>These are not actually skeletons</figcaption></figure><p style="">Players will be able to use Batman's visor and turn on Detective Mode, which will tint the screen blue and highlight points of interest such as door switches that Batman can interact with. Detective Mode also identifies enemies, even if they are behind cover and informing the player whether the enemy is armed, or about to attack. Using the visor will provide players with a tactical advantage and the ability to plan out a course of action before engaging enemies in combat. The visor also identifies vulnerable areas in the environment that Batman may interact with using his various gadgets, allowing the player to complete the various puzzle solving aspects of the game as well. Detective Mode was one of the few points of the game that was met with criticism, as leaving it on at all times was the most straightforward way to play the game, but left the player viewing the world with a blue, artificial tint, with the carefully modelled features of enemies obscured by the image of their skeletons.</p><h3>Gadgets</h3><p style="">Batman collects a multitude of gadgets throughout the game, many of which may be utilized both in combat and exploration.</p><ul><li><b><a href="/grapnel-gun/3055-4307/" data-ref-id="3055-4307">Grapnel Gun</a></b></li></ul><p style="">The Grapnel Gun is a gas-powered pistol that fires a piton attached to a high-tension wire, which has the ability to retract that line while accommodating the weight of the user. It has the ability to penetrate or affix itself to most surfaces and provide a stable anchor for the Dark Knight to elevate himself to a more desirable position.</p><ul><li><a href="/batarang/3055-2043/" data-ref-id="3055-2043"><b>Batarang</b></a></li></ul><p style="">One of Batman's signature devices, the Batarang is a <a href="/boomerang/3055-76/" data-ref-id="3055-76">boomerang</a>-like throwing weapon shaped like a bat. The player begins the game with a single Batarang. During exploration, the Batarang may be used to stun enemies that are not aware of Batman's presence, to activate otherwise inaccessible buttons, or to cut down hanging enemies. During combat, striking an enemy with a Batarang stuns them for a brief time, allowing Batman to continue a combo or move on to another foe. The Batarang may be upgraded over the course of the game into the Double- and then Multi-Batarang, eventually allowing Batman to carry and throw up to three Batarangs simultaneously. A fully-upgraded Multi-Batarang may be used to stun up to three enemies at a time.</p><ul><li><b><a href="/sonic-batarang/3055-4306/" data-ref-id="3055-4306">Sonic Batarang</a></b></li></ul><p style="">The Sonic Batarang is a separate Batarang that can be used to attract the attention of guards. Rather than being used to bludgeon and stun enemies, the Sonic Batarang will emit a loud, high-pitched noise once it is embedded in a surface, drawing the attention of curious guards to the area, making it the perfect bait for traps utilizing the Explosive Gel. However, even the Joker's henchmen aren't stupid enough to fall for the same trick more than once, and if a second Sonic Batarang is used in the same Invisible Predator sequence, the guards will simply shoot it from a distance and mock Batman. Once upgraded, the Sonic Batarang can overload the suicide collar of a nearby enemy, knocking him out as well as stunning any nearby enemies.</p><ul><li><b><a href="/batclaw/3055-4304/" data-ref-id="3055-4304">Batclaw</a></b></li></ul><p style="">The Batclaw is a strong grappling hook that Batman can use to pull far away objects towards him. It may also be used to grab enemies and remove ventilation ducts. The Batclaw is later upgraded such that three ropes are used to grab things allowing for Batman to break walls from a distance, or alternately, to grab onto three enemies at once.</p><ul><li><b><a href="/explosive-gel/3055-2697/" data-ref-id="3055-2697">Explosive Gel</a></b></li></ul><p style="">The Explosive Gel, as its name implies, is a jelly-like substance that Batman can spray onto walls and floors, and remotely explode later when he chooses to do so. It has three charges and so only three Explosive Gels can be planted at one time. A later upgrade allows Batman to individually explode a planted gel independently of any other planted gels. Although the Dark Knight is almost <i>always</i> a grim, stoic defender of justice, he shows a rare moment of whimsy while using the Explosive Gel; when placing a gel charge on a floor or wall, he sprays it in the shape of a bat.</p><ul><li><b><a href="/line-launcher/3055-4305/" data-ref-id="3055-4305">Line Launcher</a></b></li></ul><p style="">The Line Launcher is a gas-powered pistol that fires two pitons in opposite directions attached to high-tension wires. Whereas the Grapnel Gun is designed to quickly move the user to a higher position in the environment, this device is concerned with the quick traversal of lateral obstacles. The two pitons bury themselves in parallel objects and allow the user to "zip" between the two points, after which the pitons release and the lines wind back into the device.</p><h3>The Riddler's Challenge</h3><p style="">Optionally, Batman can collect trophies hidden by Edward Nigma a.k.a. the Riddler, by solving various riddles. In addition to trophies, Batman may find interview tapes of the key villains and hidden plaques from "The Spirit of Arkham" that Batman can translate, illuminating the dark history of Arkham Asylum. When Riddler hacks into Batman's communications, Batman immediately begins a trace program.</p><p style="">During the course of the game, Riddler taunts Batman, dismissing his skills as a detective and accusing him of cheating when he solves his riddles. When the player completes 237 of the 240 challenges, a display appears telling Batman the location in Gotham from which Riddler is transmitting. Upon completing the 240th challenge, the Riddler again contacts Batman, angry that the Dark Knight has beaten him. In the background, the player can hear sirens approaching, and before Riddler can complete his supposed backup plan, the police move in and arrest him.</p><h3>Hidden challenge</h3><p style="">In addition to the 240 main collectibles, there is a hidden message from the spirit of Arkham. This message is only available after finding all of the messages highlighted as Riddler challenges. After identifying all the spirit of Arkham plaques, if Batman returns to the guard control tower in the penitentiary, where Warden Sharpe was kept, the warden is missing and replaced with the final Spirit of Arkham message on the floor. Collecting this unlocks the final message from the Spirit of Arkham in the biographies, and hints at a possible plot point in the sequel.</p><h3>Combat and Predator Challenges</h3><p style="">Collecting and solving Riddler Challenges unlocks 16 arenas outside of the campaign, divided equally between combat and predator modes. In the combat arenas, the player is pitted against enemies over four rounds, the goal being to rack up as many points as possible. How many points the player is able to achieve dictates how many medals are awarded out of a possible three.</p><p style="">In the predator arenas, the player has to take out the armed foes by using his cunning skills coupled with the smart use of gadgets. Successfully taking out enemies in certain ways, for example pulling an enemy over a railing, will count towards the number of medals gained.</p><p style="">The number of medals, combat scores and the time used to complete the predator challenges goes towards unlocking specific <a href="/batman-arkham-asylum/3030-23245/achievements/" data-ref-id="3030-23245">trophies/achievements</a>, as well as being listed on a global leaderboard.</p><h2><b>Hidden room</b></h2><p style="">During the game of the year podcast, Rocksteady announced that they had hid "<i>many hooks</i>" that tie into the "<i>Arkham-verse"</i> including a hidden room inside of Warden Quincy Sharp's office. The room contained a map of <a href="/gotham-city/3035-111/" data-ref-id="3035-111">Gotham</a> that has a section quarantined and concept art for the sequel, <a href="/batman-arkham-city/3030-29443/" data-ref-id="3030-29443"><i>Batman: Arkham City</i></a>. It went undiscovered for months because it was not visible on the map, took three explosives to destroy the wall sealing the room, and cannot be seen using detective vision.</p><h2><b>Modifying the Game</b></h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48227/1559737-batman_of_the_future_by_darkknight11.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1559737" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48227/1559737-batman_of_the_future_by_darkknight11.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1559737"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/48227/1559737-batman_of_the_future_by_darkknight11.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/48227/1559737-batman_of_the_future_by_darkknight11.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Snazzy!</figcaption></figure><p style="">When the demo for <i>Batman: Arkham Asylum</i> was released, many players found out how to modify their Batman character. Players could quickly create their own Batman suit, in any way they could think of. The Rocksteady website had all of the information to change the suit. It is totally legal, and the developers allowed players to use the program called, "texmod", to create a different variant of Batman's suit. Obviously, this modifying can only be done on the PC version of the game. Many players have created <a href="/terry-mcginnis/3005-14456/" data-ref-id="3005-14456">Batman Beyond</a>, Red Robin, Adam West Batman, <a href="/nightwing/3005-8204/" data-ref-id="3005-8204">Nightwing</a>, Owlman, Batzarro, Captain America, Batman of Zur En Arrh, and many other variant of Batman's suit.

It is an original project with the story being written by <a href="/paul-dini/3040-90118/" data-ref-id="3040-90118">Paul Dini</a> who is best known as a writer, producer and editor on the highly praised cartoon <i>Batman: The Animated Series</i>. <a href="/kevin-conroy/3040-30178/" data-ref-id="3040-30178">Kevin Conroy</a> (Batman/Bruce Wayne) , <a href="/mark-hamill/3040-3248/" data-ref-id="3040-3248">Mark Hamill</a> (the Joker) and <a href="/arleen-sorkin/3040-50621/" data-ref-id="3040-50621">Arleen Sorkin</a> (Harley Quinn) all reprise their respective voice roles from <i>Batman: The Animated Series</i>. WildStorm Productions, a comic publisher founded by acclaimed comic artist <a href="/jim-lee/3040-89281/" data-ref-id="3040-89281">Jim Lee</a>, had a hand in designing various characters in the game as well.</p><p style="">The PC version of the game features <a href="/physx/3015-1923/" data-ref-id="3015-1923">PhysX</a> technology, the inclusion of which was given as the excuse for why the PC release was delayed. This allows for a very, <i>very</i> slightly more immersive experience with more interactive environments - for example, litter or paper on the floor moving around and being flung into the air during combat, or mist swirling around Batman and other characters as they move through it. The most provident use of the PhysX SDK is inside of the scarecrow sequences, where walls crumble into many pieces and are sucked into a vortex. The consoles versions also use PhysX, though this is limited to only the core features such as ragdolls and rigid bodies.</p><p style=""><i>Batman: Arkham Asylum</i> runs on <a href="/epic-games/3010-149/" data-ref-id="3010-149">Epic Game's</a> <a href="/unreal-engine-3/3015-86/" data-ref-id="3015-86">Unreal Engine 3</a>.</p><h2>Extras</h2><h3><i>Batman: Arkham Asylum</i> Collector's Edition</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/32924/950704-baa_collectorlg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-950704" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.61545454545455" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:61.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/32924/950704-baa_collectorlg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-950704"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/32924/950704-baa_collectorlg.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/32924/950704-baa_collectorlg.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Batman: Arkham Asylum Collector's Edition</figcaption></figure><p style="">The Collector's Edition of <i>Batman: Arkham Asylum</i> was released alongside the standard edition of the game on August 25th.

The two begin hanging out and slowly, as time goes by, Tomoya finds his life shifting in a new direction.</p><h3>After Story</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The After Story arc continues from where the Nagisa plot-line left off. After graduating from high school, Tomoya and Nagisa's relationship begins to enter a level of intimacy unlike before.

The After Story arc continues from where the Nagisa plot-line left off and has several possible alternate endings of its own.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Originally, the lights were meant to be <a href="/inventory/3015-513/" data-ref-id="3015-513">items </a>that players could use in the game, but since this increased the game's complexity, and detracted from the storyline, the function of the lights was simplified and made less intrusive.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">On Yukine's story path, the player can take part in a storage room spell where Tomoya will be locked up in the sports equipment storage room with a particular character. The character who will be involved will depend on the choices made up until that point.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">On Fuko's story path, the player is given the choice to play pranks on her.

Certain occasions will not allow certain pranks to be used.</p><h2>Concepts</h2><h3>Time and Date</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Time, day, and date is an important feature in Key's works.

She came looking for Takafumi and decided to freeload at Tomoya's apartment.</li></ul><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">Tomoyo After features a single main story path. It occasionally presents a dialogue choice of up to 3 options. The choices will further the story and / or influence events in the story or lead to a bad ending.</p><p style="">There is a minigame called <em>Dungeons and Takafumis</em> that can be unlocked early in the game. Once it is unlocked, the option to play it will be made available from the main menu.</p><h2>Dungeons and Takafumis</h2><p style=""><em>Dungeons and Takafumis</em> is a tactical role-playing game. Its save file is separate from the visual novel save file. According to the main story, Takafumi worked with people over the internet to create the game, and Kanako wrote the story.</p><h3>Story</h3><p style="">A castle had a laboratory where magicians created Takafumi <a href="/clone/3015-284/" data-ref-id="3015-284">clones</a>. The clones performed household chores for people in the day and worked as male escorts at night. The clones had no emotions. This changed when clone number 054 was created under the contract with a gay devil. This granted Takafumi 054 a full range of human emotions. 10 days ago, a storm hit the castle and and Takafumi 054 disappeared. Many Takafumi clones sold themselves to the beastmen to obtain information and discovered that Takafumi 054 was in a labyrinth under the beastmen's castle. The magicians were unable to defeat the beastmen, thus they resorted to hiring mercenaries.</p><h4>Floor 10</h4><p style="">Tomoyo explained that Takafumi 054 was a criminal. Kanako wanted to believe that he remembered her. Tomoyo explained that Takafumi 054 wasn't the one who saved her but Kanako wanted to see him regardless.</p><h4>Floor 25</h4><p style="">Takafumi clone 054 was discovered. He was suffering from <a href="/amnesia/3015-286/" data-ref-id="3015-286">amnesia</a>. Tomoyo tried to attack him but Kanako protected him. Takafumi 054 revealed that the beastmen were researching a time travelling magic, Almighty High Magic Delorean. Tomo explained that the beastmen intended to travel back in time to kill all humans. Takafumi 054 explained that they must reach the lowest floor and defeat the beastmen.</p><h4>Floor 30</h4><p style="">Takafumi 054 recalled a memory of a travelling swordsman who rescued Kanako and fell in love with her. He explained that that memory wasn't his own. Kanako revealed that the Takafumi who rescued her lost his life rescuing her.</p><h4>Floor 35</h4><p style="">Takafumi 054 was ambushed and kidnapped by the beastmen.</p><h4>Floor 45</h4><p style="">Takafumi 054 sent a hologram explaining that the beastmen is almost ready to cast the time travelling magic and that they only had 3 more days to stop them.</p><h4>Floor 50</h4><p style="">The beastmen successfully traveled 1000 years into the past. Tomoya, Tomoyo, Tomo, and Takafumi traveled back in time to defeat them. Kanako discovered that they had saved the world but they were no where to be seen.</p><h4>Epilogue</h4><p style="">The beastmen appeared in the Central Region and waged war against humans. They took over the Central and Eastern Regions and drove the humans to the Western Region. Tomo created Takafumi clones and formed the volunteer army led by Tomoya, Tomoyo, and Takafumi 054. They reclaimed the South and Eastern Regions within 6 months. They spent the next several years assaulting the Southwestern and Central Regions and managed to establish a base in the Central Region.</p><p style="">The beastmen withdrew their army from the east focused on the Western Region. The volunteer army assaulted the beastmen's base and successfully sealed off the beastmen's reinforcements. Tomoya, Tomoyo, and Takafumi 054 lost their lives in that battle. The remaining Takafumi clones spent the next several decades wiping out the remaining beastmen.</p><p style="">The remaining Takafumis were imprisoned and the kingdom's magicians conducted research on the clones, attempting to reverse engineer the technique to clone them. They were unsuccessful because Tomo disappeared and the cloning technique disappeared with her. The clones created by the magicians lacked emotions.</p><p style="">After Kanako read the history, she matured as a leader. She succeeded the throne after her father passed away. Kanako started a History Museum. Excavation for artifacts lasted for a year and she discovered many dead Takafumi clones. One day, she heard rumors of a living Takafumi clone in the west. The clone had no memory of her. He announced that he speaks on behalf of the real Takafumi and explained that he has returned home.</p><h3>Gameplay</h3><p style=""><em>Dungeons and Takafumis</em> consists of 2 sections, the intermission area and battles. It features familiar game elements which can be found in other tactical RPGs with one major difference.</p><h4>Intermission</h4><p style="">The Intermission area is the default area when the player is not in combat. This area allows for changing of jobs, replenishment of potions, and the save and load features.</p><h4>Battle</h4><p style="">Battles are fought on a 3D <a href="/isometric-viewpoint/3015-246/" data-ref-id="3015-246">isometric</a> <a href="/grid-based-movement/3015-1318/" data-ref-id="3015-1318">grid field</a> with 2D sprites. <em>Dungeons and Takafumis</em> employs an <a href="/active-time-battle/3015-95/" data-ref-id="3015-95">Active Time Battle</a> system, where characters with high speed stat will act more often. It features a single dungeon which consists of 50 floors. Every fifth floor will feature a <a href="/boss-fight/3015-50/" data-ref-id="3015-50">boss</a> character, which is a stone <a href="/golem/3015-2538/" data-ref-id="3015-2538">golem</a> for the first 45 floors, and a <a href="/feline-humanoid/3015-4588/" data-ref-id="3015-4588">catgirl</a> boss for the 50th floor. 5 floors must be cleared in a single attempt in order to save dungeon progression.</p><p style="">The player can also choose to retreat at any time, retaining all the items and experience that has been collected. If the party is wiped out or the player chooses to retreat, the player must fight through all 5 floors again on the next attempt. If a character dies on a floor, he or she will be revived with 1 HP on the next floor.</p><p style="">The party will be forced to retreat at floors 35 and 45 in accordance to the story.</p><h4>Days</h4><p style="">The score is recorded in number of days. Every time the player retreats, the number of days increase by 1. Thus, the least number of days in which the dungeon can be cleared is 3.</p><p style="">Clearing within 7 days awards an <a href="/s-rank/3015-2962/" data-ref-id="3015-2962">S rank</a>. 8 to 9 days awards A. 10 to 14 days awards B. 15 to 19 days awards C. 20 to 25 days awards D. 26 days or more awards E.</p><h4>Items</h4><p style="">There is no currency and shops. All equipment can only be obtained in battle with the 'Search' command and / or after clearing a floor. Items that are obtained via the 'Search' command can only be kept after the current floor is cleared. All items has its own weight and the inventory size is limited by weight. Items can be tossed away in the intermission and in battle.</p><h4>Combat</h4><p style="">Unlike most tactical RPGs, the only control the player has over combat is to set the characters up at the start of every floor. The battle will then play out until either side wins by wiping out the opposition. Actions and skills will be assigned to each character and they will carry it out in the sequence that was laid out for them. Each character also has a 'last' action that will cause the character to repeat that action until the floor is cleared, the character dies, or the team is wiped out. Characters cannot be ordered to consume potions or change equipment in combat.</p><h4>Skills</h4><p style="">Skills can only be used once per dungeon attempt. A buff or debuff skill will cause the character to stay on the same spot. An attack skill will cause the character to move towards an enemy.</p><h4>Experience</h4><p style="">Experience points will be granted to all characters who remain alive after a floor is cleared. Additional points will be granted per killing blow. A large amount of experience points will be given when a floor is cleared the first time and it will be decreased by 90% for subsequent clearings.</p><h4>Buffs and Debuffs</h4><p style="">Taunts and evade buffs cannot apply to the same character at the same time. Only the most recently cast taunt or evade will take effect.</p><h4>Stats</h4><p style="">Character stat increase at level up depends on job class. A level up grants 3 bonus stats from levels 1 to 20, 4 bonus stats from levels 21 to 40, and no bonus stats from level 41 onward.</p><table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Stat</th><th scope="col">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Attack power (ATK)</td><td>Increases physical damage dealt.

It shifts the perspective to first-person and the genre to "survival horror." It takes place in Cambodia during the time of the Vietnam Conflict.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Shellshock 2: Blood Trails was <a href="/rebellion/3010-2952/" data-ref-id="3010-2952">Rebellion</a>'s first game on the <a href="/xbox-360/3045-20/" data-ref-id="3045-20">Xbox 360</a> and <a href="/playstation-3/3045-35/" data-ref-id="3045-35">Playstation 3</a> platforms. It was also released on the <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC</a>. The game is a first-person survival horror title set during the Vietnam War. The player is cast in the role of American draftee Private Nathanial Walker, who during his journey must explore environments including the jungle, a run-down mansion, Vietcong tunnel systems, trenches, and villages.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style="">At the peak of the Vietnam War, a covert ops plane is transporting a top secret consignment known only as "Whiteknight" when it goes down over the jungles of Cambodia. A special ops team is sent out immediately to search for and locate Whiteknight. Slowly, one-by-one they disappear, in the jungles, without a trace. One month later, one of the members of the ops team stumbles out of the jungles alive, but has been driven mad. Private Nate Walker is sent to the quarantine zone where they are holding the ops member to try to get information about Whiteknight from him. As the game progresses, Nate learns why he was sent to question the operative, why the Vietcong want to take him alive, and what Whiteknight is.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Combat</h3><p style="">Combat is very similar to other first-person shooters. The player can carry flares, frag grenades, a knife, a pistol and a rifle or shotgun. Ammunition is comparatively scarce in this game however, so calm, accurate fire using the iron-sights is needed to ensure that the player will have enough ammunition.</p><p style="">During certain moments, a "grapple attack" may occur. Players are required to hit the buttons in the order they appear to defend himself. If the player is successful, he is given the choice to execute his attacker one of two ways - either with the butt of, or a single shot from, his weapon.</p><p style="">Traps are present in a few areas as well. These include a horizontally-swinging bamboo traps, spiky logs that swing down from the treetops and spiked pits. If a trap is triggered, time slows and the player is given an opportunity to save himself by pressing the button that flashes on the screen.</p><h3>Heads-Up Display</h3><p style="">The heads-up display is contextual in that it is not shown unless the player is doing something. For example, reloading briefly shows how much ammunition the player has left, and looking at a a weapon on the ground prompts the player to swap his current gun or pick up ammunition if he is carrying that type of weapon already. Instead, the player's state is reflected in other visual and audio cues. For example, blood on the screen indicates damage, and stamina is reflected by how heavy Nate is breathing. This is an attempt by the developer to increase immersion.</p><h3>Atmosphere</h3><p style="">As with many survival-horror games, immersion is an important part of Shellshock 2. In addition to the previously-mentioned HUD, lighting effects and sound design are utilized in an attempt to heighten tension.</p><h2>Critical Reception</h2><p style="">Shellshock 2: Blood Trails received mid to low reviews. Comments range from "boring" and "uninspired" to "dreadful" and "disaster." The main issues cited by critics include the imprecision of the control scheme, bad AI, and bad level design. </p><h2>PC System Requirements</h2><ul><li><strong>Operating System:</strong> Windows Vista® / XP</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Dual Core processor recommended 3GHz or higher single core processor</li><li><strong>RAM Memory:</strong> 1GB RAM (XP) / 2GB RAM (Vista)</li><li><strong>Graphics Card:</strong> 256MB with Pixel Shader model 3 (GeForce 7600 , ATI Radeon 1800 )</li><li><strong>DirectX Version:</strong> 9.0c (works on 10 but not specifically supported)</li><li><strong>Hard Drive Space:</strong> 8 GB</li><li><strong>Sound Card:</strong> Dolby 2.1, compatible with DirectX 9.0c</li></ul>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>23254</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/1817670-box_ss2bt.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/1817670-box_ss2bt.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/1817670-box_ss2bt.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/1817670-box_ss2bt.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/1817670-box_ss2bt.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1817670-box_ss2bt.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/1817670-box_ss2bt.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Shellshock 2: Blood Trails]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>1</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-16/]]></api_detail_url><id>16</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: M]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-37/]]></api_detail_url><id>37</id><name><![CDATA[PEGI: 18+]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2009-02-02 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/shellshock-2-blood-trails/3030-23254/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-23312/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-08-14 15:49:54</date_added><date_last_updated>2010-08-04 19:16:04</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[Dirty Harry (working title) was a game cited as coming to the Xbox360 and PS3, however the game has been significantly delayed and subsequently cancelled due to problems with the developer.

Interactive broke the announcement and explained that they would be working alongside Clint Eastwood, the house-hold name who bought the infamous lead character to fame in the 1971 film, as well as Eastwoods own  Malpaso and The Tehama Companies. Eastwoods involvement was explained as that of a creative consultant, as well as voice actor of the legendary cop.<br/><br/><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7776/822570-dirty_harry.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-822570" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.1333333333333" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:113.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7776/822570-dirty_harry.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-822570"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7776/822570-dirty_harry.jpg"></a><figcaption>"A man's gotta know his limitations."</figcaption></figure>Clint Eastwood himself appeared enthusiastic at bringing 'Dirty' Harry Calahan to a prospective new audience. "This will be an opportunity to satisfy the many requests over the years to continue the <em>Dirty Harry</em> legacy, only now in the video game medium," Eastwood remarked. "Creating <em>Dirty Harry</em> video games will also introduce this memorable film character to new generations on a medium they appreciate."<br/>At the time, no company was announced but it was revealed that the platforms the game would be coming to would be the Xbox360 and the Playstation 3.<br/>In a series of interviews later that day, Jason Hall, Senior Vice President at Warner Bros. Interactive seemed reluctant to express any furthur comments regarding the game itself but spoke highly of Clint Eastwood and his involvement, as well as citing all 5 of the Dirty Harry pictures as personal favourite films.<br/><br/>News on the project went silent until May 16, 2005 when Warner Bros. Interactive broke the news that they had found a developer to tackle the project. The company stepping up to the task were The Collective, who up to that point where known best as the developers of the <a data-ref-id="3030-15717" href="/buffy-the-vampire-slayer/3030-15717/" slug="buffy-the-vampire-slayer">  Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a> game for the Xbox and the recently released <a data-ref-id="3030-9200" href="/star-wars-episode-iii-revenge-of-the-sith/3030-9200/" slug="star-wars-episode-iii-revenge-of-the-sith">  Star Wars: Episode III-Revenge of the Sith</a> movie-tie-in game.<br/>Doug Hare, co-founder and Vice President of Production for The Collective said that "Working with Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment and Clint Eastwood to create a compelling, state-of-the-art game that brings Dirty Harry Callahan to life on next generation consoles is very exciting,"<br/><br/><h3>Feeling Lucky, Punk?</h3>From that point on there was little news of Harry or his game for almost a year. Then on May 10, 2006 Warner Bros. Interactive and The Collective made an appearence at  E3 with a roster of big-name actors who would be accompanying Clint Eastwood by lending their likenesses and voices to the game. Gene Hackman was announced as Police Supervisor Al Bressler, whilst  <a data-ref-id="3040-73146" href="/laurence-fishburne/3040-73146/" slug="laurence-fishburne">  Laurence Fishburne</a> was cast in the part of Reverend Carlton Clay. Previously, Eastwood had worked with both of these stars, directing and starring with Hackman in Unforgiven and directing Fishburne in Mystic River.<br/><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7776/822573-harry1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-822573" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.57627118644068" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:57.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7776/822573-harry1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-822573"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7776/822573-harry1.jpg"></a><figcaption>We know it's been 37 years Clint, but sheesh...</figcaption></figure><br/>Word rapidly spread that footage of the game itself was being shown 'behind closed doors' at E3. Later that day Warner Bros. Interactive began dishing out information to journalists.<br/>It was announced that the game itself would be released in 2007 and would coincide with a new 5 disc collectors edition of the original movies on DVD. It was also revealed that the game would take place between Dirty Harry and Magnum Force, the first two films in the saga.<br/>A trailer was shown which Warner Bros. Interactive were quick to explain was neither a CGI-cutscene, nor strictly gameplay footage. The company had apparently taken their character models and engine schematics to an animation house who produced the trailer. The level of detail in the trailer was lauded as impressive and many journalists believed that the game was on course to capture the '70's vibe' of the movies. Because Eastwood had not yet recorded a voice over, the dialogue in the trailer was pulled straight from the films themselves. Although the trailer itself offered no actual sense of gameplay, the animation was intended to simulate what the gameplay would be like in the finished product.<br/>Although Warner Bros. Interactive were particularly reluctant to discuss the gameplay and plot of the game, a few key facts were uncovered. A comment from the Jason Hall, the Vice President of Warner Bros. Interactive sparked mass speculation that the game would be that of the sandbox variety when he commented that "The city of San Francisco can be a character, it can live."<br/>The story was also explained as not a straight link from the end of Dirty Harry through til the beginning of Magnum Force, rather a progressive plot that would allow the character to be explored.<br/>It was also explained that players would be expected to walk the line between bad cop and psychopath. Being just a bad cop would cause criminals to lose fear and respect for you, but acting like too much of a psychopath would get you in trouble with your superiors.<br/><br/><h3>Feeling kind of Unlucky, actually...</h3>On March 1, 2007, Gamespot announced that developers of Dirty Harry, The Collective were laying off approximately 30 of it's employees following Warner Bros Interactive Entertainment's revoking the studio's rights to develop the game. A spokesman for Foundation 9 (the company for which The Collective is a subsidiary) refused to mention numbers but remained adamant that the projects failing was far from destruction for The Collective.<br/><br/>Despite the obvious setback, Warner Bros. Interactive made it clear that production of a Dirty Harry video game is certainly still underway.<br/>Although she refused to disclose where the project had been relocated to, Warner Bros. Interactive's Senior Vice President, Samantha Ryan had this to say: "We are moving forward with the Dirty Harry next generation videogames and will be changing our development plans in keeping with the best interest of the franchise legacy. WBIE is dedicated to creating a game that will bring Clint Eastwood's legendary Detective Harry Callahan character to the interactive space with a new story and great gameplay."<br/><br/>At the time, it was made apparent that The Collective were still working on two other next-generation titles and that it was only the Dirty Harry team that was affected. However, later in the year, the company merged with Shiny Entertainment to form Double Helix games. One of the two titles they were producing, Harker was also cancelled, however the other title, revealed to be Silent Hill: Homecoming was completed under the new expanded companys supervision.<br/><br/><h2>Harry's Future</h2><br/>Ever since Warner Bros. Interactive's initial response that the Dirty Harry game is still in production from March 1, 2007, nothing has been heard of the project. The future of the project, if any at all has remained tightly under wraps by Warner Bros. Interactive. Warner Bros. has said as of now the game is not being developed however they do want to eventually finish and release the game.]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>23312</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/3/34651/1194336-0dirtyharryps3.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/34651/1194336-0dirtyharryps3.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/3/34651/1194336-0dirtyharryps3.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/34651/1194336-0dirtyharryps3.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/3/34651/1194336-0dirtyharryps3.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/3/34651/1194336-0dirtyharryps3.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/3/34651/1194336-0dirtyharryps3.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Dirty Harry]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating/><original_release_date/><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/dirty-harry/3030-23312/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[Overlord 2]]></aliases><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-23317/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-08-14 17:58:09</date_added><date_last_updated>2015-11-16 23:20:57</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[The sequel to Overlord, this is a unique and strategic Adventure game that allows control of an Overlord character who possesses mischief-making, loyal minions that bid his doing of evil or good.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Overlord II is a <a href="/third-person-perspective/3015-464/" data-ref-id="3015-464">third-person</a> action-adventure game developed by <a href="/triumph-studios/3010-3354/" data-ref-id="3010-3354">Triumph Studios</a> and published by <a href="/codemasters/3010-491/" data-ref-id="3010-491">Codemasters</a> for the <a href="/xbox-360/3045-20/" data-ref-id="3045-20">Xbox 360</a>, <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC</a> and <a href="/playstation-3/3045-35/" data-ref-id="3045-35">Playstation 3.</a> Overlord II is the sequel to the original Overlord <a href="/overlord/3030-21864/" data-ref-id="3030-21864">video game</a> and was released in June 2009.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p style="">Overlord II follows the events of the Raising Hell <a href="/expansion/3015-344/" data-ref-id="3015-344">expansion pack</a> from the first game. Shortly after the old <a href="/the-overlord/3005-1325/" data-ref-id="3005-1325">Overlord's</a> disappearance, the Tower Heart was broken causing the Cataclysm, which in turn destroyed the locations of the first game and started a <a href="/magic/3015-98/" data-ref-id="3015-98">magical</a> <a href="/disease/3015-494/" data-ref-id="3015-494">plague</a>. The survivors fled to new lands where the Glorious Empire comes into being, and begins to take control of the new lands while purging all magical creatures. The Glorious Empire mimics many features of the ancient Roman empire.</p><p style="">As shown in <i>R</i>aising Hell, the previous Overlord's mistress, <a href="/rose/3005-10247/" data-ref-id="3005-10247">Rose</a>, gives birth to his child. This child is both the new Overlord and the player character. He is taken to the mountain village of Nordberg and left there. In the village, he is treated as an outcast and all of the villagers refer to him as <a href="/witch/3015-707/" data-ref-id="3015-707">Witch</a>-Boy.</p><p style=""><a href="/minions/3015-1747/" data-ref-id="3015-1747">Minions</a> find him during his childhood and, believing that he has the potential to become their new master, help him escape when the Glorious Empire attack Nordberg. The villagers on the other hand <a href="/sacrifice/3015-1213/" data-ref-id="3015-1213">offer him up</a> to save the town. The reason behind the attack is that the empire senses the growing magical energy in the overlord child. A <a href="/yetis/3015-1448/" data-ref-id="3015-1448">yeti</a>, freed by the Overlord during his escape over an ice-covered <a href="/lake/3035-2096/" data-ref-id="3035-2096">lake</a>, causes the ice sheet to break, freezing the Overlord until his Minions take him to the <a href="/hell/3035-24/" data-ref-id="3035-24">Netherworld</a>. The player character is then raised by <a href="/gnarl/3005-7690/" data-ref-id="3005-7690">Gnarl</a> and the Minions as the new Overlord.</p><p style="">Upon coming-of-age and passing Gnarl's tests, the player scouts the Nordberg countryside, encountering a band of <a href="/elf/3015-537/" data-ref-id="3015-537">fanatical environmentalist Elves</a> lead by Florian Greenheart. The Elves try and prevent him from <a href="/murder/3015-1654/" data-ref-id="3015-1654">slaying</a> baby seals, and take in the yeti. The Overlord then heads to one of the Elves' nearby <a href="/church/3035-1395/" data-ref-id="3035-1395">sanctuaries</a> and proceeds to destroy it, an act that earns him the <a href="/favored-enemy/3015-4093/" data-ref-id="3015-4093">hatred</a> of the Elf Queen Fay. During this time the observed actions of the Glorious Empire leads Gnarl to classify it as a threat, and the Overlord heads out to <a href="/conquer-the-world/3015-1003/" data-ref-id="3015-1003">conquer the world</a> and destroy the Empire.</p><p style="">He begins by capturing Nordberg and taking Kelda, the only girl in the village who was not afraid of him as a child, as his mistress, and choosing to either <a href="/slavery/3015-1779/" data-ref-id="3015-1779">enslave</a> or destroy the village. The Overlord and his horde of minions soon travel to the flooded Everlight Reef to gain access into the Elven lands of Everlight.</p><p style="">Upon arriving, the Overlord finds that Everlight has already been captured by the Empire. Its nobles use the area as a <a href="/hotels/3035-1998/" data-ref-id="3035-1998">holiday resort</a>, where they have all become lazy and <a href="/overweight-character/3015-2047/" data-ref-id="3015-2047">fat</a> due to the round the clock service by former elf residents, who the Empire enslaved. The Overlord gains control of Everlight and takes Juno, a <a href="/succubus/3015-374/" data-ref-id="3015-374">seductress</a> accused of being a witch by other Empire women, as a mistress. He then kills or enslaves the town's inhabitants. Juno tells the Overlord how to access the Empire's main city, but while attempting to sneak in, the Overlord falls into the <a href="/shanty-town/3035-2305/" data-ref-id="3035-2305">slums</a>. Exploring the slums results in the Overlord being captured and sent to the <a href="/arena/3035-1744/" data-ref-id="3035-1744">Arena</a>, a large Coliseum-like structure where magical beings are killed in <a href="/gladiators/3015-3247/" data-ref-id="3015-3247">gladiatorial games</a>. The Overlord beats all opponents, and when the yeti is brought out to face him the player has the option of either weakening and capturing the yeti, or killing it.</p><p style="">Back at the Netherworld tower, the Overlord is visited by a mysterious woman who Gnarl vaguely recognizes. The Overlord travels to the Wastelands, where the old tower resided. Gnarl tasks him with finding the shards of the Tower Heart. After encountering the Elves in their main sanctuary, Queen Fay and Florian help the Overlord to reassemble the Tower Heart. Florian is <a href="/kidnapping/3015-1885/" data-ref-id="3015-1885">captured</a> by the Empire after leading the Overlord to the shards, and Fay regretfully allows the Overlord to drain four shrines to power up the Tower Heart. The Tower Heart still needs more power, so the Overlord also drains Fay of her magical energy, <a href="/corruption/3015-2899/" data-ref-id="3015-2899">corrupting</a> her and taking her as his third mistress.</p><p style="">With the Tower Heart restored, the Overlord <a href="/siege-warfare/3015-2568/" data-ref-id="3015-2568">lays siege</a> to the Empire’s capital by catapulting the Heart itself into the city’s anti-magic barrier. While laying waste to the city's <a href="/temple/3035-1263/" data-ref-id="3035-1263">temples</a>, the Overlord is confronted once again by the mysterious woman who reveals herself as Rose, the old Overlord’s mistress and current Overlord’s mother. She discloses that the Empire was to bring order to the land for balance between <a href="/good-vs-evil/3015-1169/" data-ref-id="3015-1169">good and evil</a>, but Solarius let the power go to his head. Upon storming the palace, Florian appears, and reveals that he is Solarius. Because he was a non-magical Elf, he attempted to harness the power of the abandoned Tower Heart, but instead caused the Cataclysm and spawned the fear of magic. From this hatred, he created the Empire and gathered the magic of the <a href="/earth/3035-65/" data-ref-id="3035-65">world's</a> inhabitants for his own use. The raw magical energy drained from the captured magical creatures was collected in a <a href="/cauldron/3055-2478/" data-ref-id="3055-2478">vat</a>, which Solarius dives into. The result is that he becomes a giant, leech-like monster, which is hailed as the Devourer by Marius. The Overlord battles and destroys the Devourer and Solarius.</p><p style="">Depending on the player’s actions during the game, <a href="/multiple-endings/3015-27/" data-ref-id="3015-27">one of three ending</a> <a href="/cutscene/3015-22/" data-ref-id="3015-22">cutscenes</a> plays: one for pure <a href="/domination/3015-743/" data-ref-id="3015-743">Domination</a>, one for pure Destruction, and one for all other points on the scale. The Overlord either destroys the land or enslaves the populace, with the minions throwing huge parties. Either way, Gnarl reveals that even the Overlord’s power might wane (with the implication that he is biding his time), finishing once again with "Evil always finds a way".</p><h2>Minion Types</h2><p style="">The minions act as the main battle force for the Overlord. They soldier on at the command of the Overlord, leading the charge and taking the brunt of most of the enemy attacks. The game offers four different types of minions for the Overlord to control.</p><h3>Brown Minions</h3><p style="">The brown minions are the first type gained and act as the main fighting force. Due to this they have the highest strength, defense and <a href="/hit-points/3015-400/" data-ref-id="3015-400">hit points</a>. Upgrade their stats by having them pick up armor and weapons from defeated enemies. Brown minions also ride <a href="/wolf/3015-2265/" data-ref-id="3015-2265">wolf</a> mounts. On wolves, the browns gain a charge ability allowing them to both jump over gaps and more easily break through Empire formations.</p><h3>Red Minions</h3><p style="">Red minions are the ranged unit of the game. Typically they take position and aim <a href="/fireball/3055-120/" data-ref-id="3055-120">fireballs</a> at their foes, until they set fire to enemy forces. Reds are not only immune to <a href="/fire/3015-1443/" data-ref-id="3015-1443">fire damage</a>, but they also absorb fire to help clear the path for the Overlord and the other minion types. Red minions ride <a href="/fire-lizard/3015-6326/" data-ref-id="3015-6326">salamander</a> mounts. Being mounted boosts their attacks and allows them to shoot fire while moving. Salamanders also easily traverse very steep slopes.</p><h3>Green Minions</h3><p style="">Green minions act as the <a href="/assassin/3015-1321/" data-ref-id="3015-1321">stealth</a> units. When set on a target they turn <a href="/invisibility/3015-317/" data-ref-id="3015-317">invisible</a>, ready to pounce on larger foes. The sneak attack gives greens a greater potential for damage than the brown minions. Green minions are immune to <a href="/poison/3015-287/" data-ref-id="3015-287">poison</a>, and absorb it into their bodies. Green minions ride <a href="/spider/3015-1873/" data-ref-id="3015-1873">spider</a> mounts, allowing them to traverse <a href="/spider-web/3055-2060/" data-ref-id="3055-2060">webs</a> in order to access new areas.</p><h3>Blue Minions</h3><p style="">Blue minions have little to no combat ability, but make up for it with the ability to <a href="/resurrection/3015-1225/" data-ref-id="3015-1225">revive dead minions</a>. Blues are also the only minions with the ability to <a href="/swimming/3015-2499/" data-ref-id="3015-2499">swim</a> in the game. Unlike other minions, they are not able to ride a mount but instead can dispel magic, which becomes of great importance both in the wasteland and in the final battle of the game.</p><h2>Multi player</h2><h3>Slaughter</h3><p style="">This mode pits two Overlords against each other where each player must kill as many enemies on the map as possible in exchange for points. It is also possible to kill the other player for a large bonus in points.</p><h3>Pillage</h3><p style="">This mode is similar to slaughter, but this time players must collect as much <a href="/gold/3055-83/" data-ref-id="3055-83">gold</a> as possible, by either opening the numerous <a href="/treasure-chest/3055-517/" data-ref-id="3055-517">chests</a> or collecting <a href="/moneybag/3055-2473/" data-ref-id="3055-2473">bags</a> scattered across the map. Players can kill each other for a chance to <a href="/theft/3015-1064/" data-ref-id="3015-1064">steal</a> some of their opponents gold.</p><h3><a href="/survival/3015-1297/" data-ref-id="3015-1297">Survival</a></h3><p style="">Players work together to fend of increasingly difficult waves of enemies and fight to last as long as possible.</p><h3>Protect Your Power</h3><p style="">This mode is similar to survival, but instead the players must defend an object from being destroyed from the never-ending tide of monsters.</p><h2>Development</h2><p style="">The game allows players to control a new Overlord as the playable character, as was hinted near the end of the expansion pack, Overlord: Raising Hell. This new <a href="/silent-protagonist/3015-54/" data-ref-id="3015-54">protagonist</a> is the son of the original Overlord who arrives at a time when the Glorious Empire, the dominant world society, is on a <a href="/campaign/3015-4011/" data-ref-id="3015-4011">campaign</a> to destroy anything to do with magic, including the remnants of the Overlords realm. The Glorious Empire is Overlord II's take on the Roman Empire and the developer hopes the setting will provide an avenue for <a href="/satire/3015-1076/" data-ref-id="3015-1076">political satire</a> and a cultural touchstone.</p><p style="">The new theme in this sequel is domination versus destructive evil continually presenting the player with the <a href="/moral-decisions/3015-93/" data-ref-id="3015-93">choice</a> to either destroy his enemies, or enslave and exploit them. Each will have its benefits and will change the player's path through the game. Other new features include both the introduction of siege machines that you can order your minions to control, and different mounts that grant the minions extra abilities. Controlling the the Overlord in the <a href="/sequel/3015-3178/" data-ref-id="3015-3178">sequel</a> remains much the same, but the scope of the battles increases with bigger battlefields and more enemies on-screen at one time.

4.  Also under your control is your economy during the game, you can choose to make more money, do more damage, or have better armor for all of your towers.  You can choose any combination of these but the unselected ones will go down as a result.  You can have none selected as a balanced economy or have one or two selected.<br/><br/><h2>Towers</h2>Note: This is not a full list of towers yet.<br/><ul class="plain-list"><li><b>Machine Gun Tower</b> - A tower with machine guns that can fire at both land and air enemies.</li> <li><b>Mortar Tower</b> - A tower with long range mortar shells with splash damage against ground enemies.</li> <li><b>Anti-air Tower</b> - A tower with a medium range defense against airborne enemies.</li> <li>Orbital Bombardment - effective against large swarms of airborne enemies.<br/></li> <li>???</li> <li><b>Chaos Tower</b> - A tower that slows down all enemies in its range.</li> <li><b>Mine Tower</b> - A tower that fires mines into places that are not currently occupied by Insectocytes</li> <li><b>Laser Tower</b> - A tower that fires a sustained laser at enemies dealing a large amount of damage against a single target.  This tower needs to recharge between targets.</li> <li><b>Blocking Tower</b> - A cheap tower that can be places on lower terrain to force enemies onto a different path.  These can be attacked and destroyed just as much as other towers on the ground.  Another tower can be placed on top of a blocking tower.</li> <li>???</li> <li><b>Repair Tower</b> - A tower that can repair surrounding damaged towers.</li> <li><b>Amp Tower </b>- A tower that significantly increases the range and damage of towers in its range.  It does not effect Orbital, Chaos, and Mine towers.</li> </ul> <br/><h2>Insectocytes</h2>Note: This is not a full list of enemies yet.<br/><ul class="plain-list"><li><b>Swarmer</b> - Generic enemy that attacks most often in large groups.  This unit doesn't have any attack power.</li> <li><b>Soldier</b> - Basic enemy attack unit that will attack any tower that crosses its path.</li> <li><b>Flyer</b> - Basic flying enemy that does not attack.</li> <li><b>Gargantuan</b> - Huge heavily armored slow moving enemy that is devastating to towers it comes across.</li> <li><b>Sting</b> - A flying creature with ranged attacks.</li> <li><b>Slicer</b> - A worm-like enemy that attacks any tower in its path.</li> <li><b>Flying Queen</b> - Massive flying Insectocyte with a lot of health.</li> <li><b>Womb</b> - A large walking creature that carries a number of Insectocytes inside it.  Once destroyed the inner creatures come out.</li> <li><b>Tank</b> - A medium armored enemy that has evolved to have a ranged firing mechanism.</li> <li><b>Sprinter</b> - A fast and well armored enemy.</li> <li>???</li> <li>???</li> </ul> <br/><h2>Expansion Pack<br/></h2>Titled "Waldgeist Expansion", available on selected PSN Stores comes with trophies, revamps and new gameplay features: <br/> <ul class="plain-list"><li>6 new levels that bring a riot of new colours and environments into the game.</li><li>2 new evolutions of the Insectocytes; the aptly named Death Blossom – a frightening new adaptation that when it reaches a concentration of towers, explodes launching a payload of deadly guided missiles in a single barrage of devastation to all within it’s range. There is also the ‘Invisibugs’ adaptation; a new photochromatic skin pigment in some Insectocytes that render them invisible to normal attack towers.</li><li>2 new tower types; fortunately the human techies have also been busy. They have developed a counter to the ‘Invisibugs’ in the form of a sensor tower that allows all other towers within it’s range to target them.

A whole host of new challenges for Commanders to show their superior grasp of tactics, examples of which are; the Insectocyte Juggler Award (keep an Insectocyte alive for 5 minutes) and the Luddite Trophy (complete any 5 levels using only Machine Gun Towers and without any damage to the base)</li><li>New Music; Thanks to <a href="http://www.myspace.com/parasitexxxx" rel="nofollow">  Parasite</a>, our sound producer and musician, we also have new music in the new levels AND bonus hidden remix tracks that unlock including exclusive tracks by <a href="http://www.myspace.com/subliminalsystem" rel="nofollow">  Subliminal       System</a>, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/monk3ylogic" rel="nofollow">  Monk3ylogic</a> and of course, Parasite. </li></ul>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>23319</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/0/2488/721170-dump111.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2488/721170-dump111.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/0/2488/721170-dump111.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2488/721170-dump111.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/2488/721170-dump111.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2488/721170-dump111.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/0/2488/721170-dump111.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Savage Moon]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating/><original_release_date>2009-01-29 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-88/]]></api_detail_url><id>88</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation Network (PS3)]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-network-ps3/3045-88/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3N]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-116/]]></api_detail_url><id>116</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation Network (PSP)]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-network-psp/3045-116/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PSPN]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/savage-moon/3030-23319/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-23320/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-08-14 19:09:32</date_added><date_last_updated>2014-03-11 01:45:49</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[An MMORPG that was being developed by South Korean company Webzen for PC and PlayStation 3.

Godfather II is set in 1959 and has been expanded to take place over 3 cities: <a href="../../miami/95-787/" rel="nofollow">Miami</a>, <a href="../../havana/95-1142/" rel="nofollow">Havana</a> and <a href="../../new-york/95-109/" rel="nofollow">New York City</a>.</p><p style="">In the game you play as Dominic a young man in the employ of Aldo Trapini, the previous game's protagonist. When Aldo is shot and killed by Cuban revolutionaries, Michael Corleone charges you with taking over his role within the family and from there you must begin expanding the family's control of the crime world. In order to achieve this, you get tips and help from Frank Pentangeli, an old made man, to gather up a family and start taking over rackets and businesses. The game's story is loosely based on The Godfather: Part Two, the movie by <a href="/francis-ford-coppola/3040-17054/" data-ref-id="3040-17054">Francis Ford Coppola</a>.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Single Player</h3><p style="">The game play has a conquest like feel, in that the individual rackets in the city are controlled by rival families, and you are tasked with getting these rackets under the control of your family by intimidating them to pay for your protection. To do this you can send members of your gang to rival controlled territories to weaken them by doing things like bombing their buildings which outright destroys the racket for a period of time. You can also take out members of the rival family. If the family member is taken out, they can't defend their rackets or attack your rackets. Also, they won't be at their family's compound when you try to take their compound. Once they are weak enough, you can attack these rackets and try to defeat them and make them your own. Taking a territory doesn’t guarantee its safety though, and you will have to hire guards in case someone tries to take a territory from you. Depending on number of the guards you set for your territories, they will cost you money and reduce your daily payout. When another family invades your rackets, you can either go and defend it by yourself or send one or two of your family members to defend the business, because usually, ordinary guards won't last long in a full scale attack. Taking over all the crime ring areas rewards you with a bonus like armored cars, brass knuckles, bullet proof vests, etc, depending on which one you take over. After taking over all rackets of a family, they will go defensive in their compounds. You can go there and destroy their compound with a bomb, and then, they're done for ever and the former compound is yours. As said before, rackets have related activities, and taking over a ring of rackets with the same activity will reward you with items and circumstances that reduces the game's difficulty. The crime rings are listed below:</p><ol><li>Gambling- Rewards incendiary ammo.</li><li>Arms Smuggling- Rewards increase of explosive carriage.</li><li>Diamond Smuggling- Rewards Bulletproof vest for your family and guards.</li><li>Chop Shop- Rewards armored car parked in front of them and every airport as well.</li><li>Adult Entertainment- Rewards reduce of Guard payout.</li><li>Prostitution- Rewards Brass Knuckles.</li><li>Drug- Double's the income cash from this ring.</li><li>Constructions- Your businesses will recover quickly.</li><li>Gun Running- Increases ammo capacity.</li><li>Extorting Business- 9 Shops including bars and electrical stores, only increases money.</li></ol><p style="">Families are listed below:</p><ol><li>Carmine Rosato Family- New York</li><li>Tony Rosato Family- New York and Miami</li><li>Mamango Family- Havana and Miami</li><li>Almeida- Havana and Miami</li></ol><p style="">There are other activities than racketeering as well. Some pedestrians will give you intel and money if you do them a "Favor". They can be burglary, murder, sabotage, and other crimes. Intel that they'll give you is a "Kill condition" for another family's made men. If you don't kill a made man with their special kill condition, they'll disappear from the map for a brief time, then return. They'll disappear for good if you follow the "Kill Condition" instructions sharply. For example, hitting them with a car or throwing them in a river. Other favors will give you money.</p><p style="">The Black Hand controls make a return in this game, in which you use the triggers to grab your enemy and beat them with your fists, or environmental objects until they agree to cooperate with you. A new feature added to this section is "Weak Point". Every shopkeeper and business owner you're intimidating has a personal weak point witch you can discover and use to increase their payout. For example, some shopkeepers are afraid of physical attack, some will agree to cooperate with you after you smashed their goods or consumers and many other various weak points.</p><p style="">This time around you will be able to create your own family. in order to expend your family, you should search cities for guys with a dollar icon over their head. Once you approach them, you can ask them about their specialties. There are six kind of made man you can hire:</p><ol><li>Demolition: Bomb experts. you can use them to rig cars and bring rackets and compounds down.</li><li>Arsonist: You can use them to ignite a place.</li><li>Safe Cracker: They will open locks and safes for you.</li><li>Engineer: They can use tools and hardware to make your job easier, for example, cutting a fence to open up your way through them.</li><li>Buiser: Bull guys, they can be useful during a combat and they can kick down weak doors.</li><li>Medic: they can revive your family member defeated in a combat. otherwise, you have to do it yourself.</li></ol><p style="">Each class will help you during a battle and they won't be a weasel. They will talk to you and give you tips about things. Simultaneously, you can have three of your seven made men following you. You can use rest of them to defend your turf, as said before. You will be able to manage your criminal empire with "The Don's View" where you can see all the statuses of your crime rings, battles in progress, locations of your jobs, and contacts. You can decide actively which crime ring to go after, hire guards for your critical rackets, deploy your made men, and finally place hits on your rival families. Don's View is a three dimensional map that has your interest points marked in it. Also, you can set a waypoint in it. When you're in the Don's View, by pressing a button, you will be taken to your territory console. You can see your family tree in there, using it to promote, discard or upgrade a made man. (You can upgrade your own skills too). Skills that can be upgraded are various, Health, Survival, Speciality upgrade, Aim Accuracy, etc. You can see another family's tree as well. Once you killed a made man from that family, their picture on the tree will be covered with blood, indicating that they're finished. From Don's View, you can view the active favors. Favors are marked with a lip-lop shaped circle on the map. You can access you inventory, and see where the "Corrupt Officials" are. Corrupt officials are officials that will help you if you do a favor for them. For example, a cop will call back his friends if you smash a shop for him, a construction site boss will send his workers to rebuild your damaged business. You can travel between the cities by airplane and in each of them, you can access another city through Don's View. "The Don's View" gives the game an RTS feel in some ways.</p><p style="">You can simultaneously carry four kinds of weaponry. Three kind of explosives, including Dynamite, Cocktail Molotov, and Bomb. One melee weapon, like a pool cue, baseball bat, or a garrote wire for a stealth kill. There are also projectile weapons. Each type of projectile weapon has three tiers which upgrade your previous weapon of the same type. For instance, your default Tommy Gun can be upgraded by finding a MP38 which offers a better magazine size. These different weapons can only be found in certain places in the game world. Projectile weapons are:</p><ol><li>Pistol: Pistol (Level 1, Default), Silenced Pistol (Level 2, Florida- On table during your rescue mission for one of Hyman Roth's men), Delta M1911 Silenced (Level 3, Florida- Second Floor of Mangano Compound)</li><li>Magnum: .357 Magnum (Level 1, Default), .44 Magnum (Level 2, New York- Second Floor in Carmine Rosato's Compound), .501 Magnum Enforcer (Level 3, Cuba- Located inside Battaglia Quarry Chop Shop near Lighthouse)</li><li>Machine Gun: Tommy Gun (Level One, Default), MP38 (Level 2, Florida- Second Floor of the Granados Compound), Modified AK-47 (Level 3, Cuba- Battaglia Masonry, Go inside smaller room, turn left and climb down the ladder, then follow the tunnel underground)</li><li>Shotgun: Shotgun (Level 1, Default), Sawed-Off Shotgun (Level 2, New York- Use arsonist to burn bushes near Corleone Compound), Schofield Semi Auto (Level 3, Florida- Inside Global Storage Chop Shop on wall in the right side building)</li><li>Sniper Rifle: Sniper Rifle (Level 1, Default), Spitzer Centerfire (Level 2, Florida- On rooftop of Emilio's Packing Company, use engineer to cut fence), Vintovka SR-98 (Level 3, Cuba- On second floor of Almeida Compound)</li></ol><p style="">With these weapons you can also use brutal executions on enemies. These brutal executions provide a more graphic or gruesome way to kill your enemies. Just weaken the enemy substantially, but don't kill them. Go up to them and click in the right stick to use an execution on the enemy to kill them in a more gruesome way. Every type of weapon in the game has their own unique execution.</p><p style="">Just like the original, you can drive vehicles in the game. The variety of the cars can't be compared to a game like Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, but they're still away from being frustrating after a while, which was one of weak points in the original one. Controlling a car is much easier, and you can avoid damage easily because in corners, optionally you can make the car to turn by itself. (developers didn't mean that straightly, of course).</p><h3>Multiplayer</h3><p style="">There will be an online option as well that will be able to support up to 16 players. In this mode, you will be playing as the made men. All the abilities you earned in single player will appear online with your made men. In return, rewards from online play called "Honors" can then be used to get more upgrades for your made men in single player like advanced weapon licenses and more powerful firearms. The online modes include <u><b>Team Deathmatch</b></u>, the bloodiest of the modes, <u><b>Fire starters</b></u>, focusing on setting the most fires and maintaining score multipliers with your arsonists, <u><b>Demolition Assault</b></u>, the most team centric mode where players have to destroy three enemy controlled points on the map using their demolition expert, and <u><b>Safe cracker</b></u>, used to control the most territory using the safe cracking specialist. After it's first day of release, EA patched the game with a new multiplayer mode called <u><b>Don Control</b></u> where up to 16 players wager money that they earned in the single player for the ultimate control. As a Don, players will compete to recruit members online and if you lose as the Don, your money in the single player campaign is wagered away and your single player empire is hurt.</p><p style=""> </p><p style="">The servers for the online multiplayer component of Godfather 2 were turned off on April 13th, 2012.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style="">Unlike the original game where the beginning scenes coincided with the beginning of The Godfather, the story of this sequel starts with the visit of Michael Corleone in Cuba unlike in the movie where the film begins with Michael Corleone's son's first Communion in Lake Tahoe. The game also never mentions the other half of the movie which documents the rise of Vito Corleone when he first comes to America. Michael and several other Dons are there in order to make a deal with an older gangster, Hyman Roth. Unlike the movie, the Cuban revolt begins to gain success faster than seen in the movie: the revolutionaries interrupt Roth's birthday and take over areas of the city. Dominic (the player), Michael and Aldo (the protagonist of the original game, now a don himself) have to make their way to the airport and fly back to New York City. Before they enter the airport, however, Aldo gets shot and immediately dies. On the plane ride back, Michael offers Dominic to take Aldo's place. With help from Frank Pentangeli, who currently runs Corleone's businesses and assets in New York while Michael is in Nevada, Dominic hires a soldier to become a made man and begins to take over the New York by weakening the other families.</p><p style="">The first family you must take over is Carmine Rosato's family, who took over some of New York's territories after the death of Aldo. After taking over some of his territories, Carmine offers a sit down to make peace between your families. Dominic goes with Frank Pentangeli. Of course, the sit down is a trap and you are almost killed along with Frank. After Dominic escapes, he takes over the rest of Carmine's rackets in New York and takes down the Carmine Rosato Compound, thus eliminating the family.</p><p style="">Dominic is then called down to Florida to meet with Hyman Roth. He asks you to rescue one of his men and after you do so, he gives you a safehouse in Florida. Dominic then battles against the Granados Family and Tony Rosato's Family, the brother of Carmine. After substantially weakening the two families and possibly destroying them, you are called back to New York by Michael. Unfortunately, there is a strike at the airport. There you meet Hyman Roth again, who introduces Dominic to Agent Henry Mitchell of the CIA who tells Dominic to kill the instigator of the strike, who he calls a Communist sympathizer. After you take him out, Dominic can finally travel to New York.</p><p style="">Once in New York, Michael tells Dominic that the Corleone Family is under investigation by a Senate Committee and that they have a witness in Frank Pentangelli who survived the attack against him and now believes that Michael betrayed him. He then gives you Tom Hagen to be your Consigliere. Hagen then tasks you with getting a senator, Pat Geary, on your side. To do this, Dominic allow Geary access to one of the Corleone's brothels. When Geary is there, they make him believe that he killed one of the prostitutes. Once Geary is on your side, he informs Dominic of a new family in Miami called the Mangano family. Dominic initially starts an alliance with the Manganos, but once Dominic is attacked in his safehouse, he suspects the Mangano family is responsible. He attacks one of their warehouses and the Manganos break off the alliance, telling Michael that they were not behind the attack.</p><p style="">After Dominic goes to war with the Manganos, he goes to Hyman Roth and Agent Mitchell to help him. They tell him that Dominic must go to Cuba to assassinate Fidel Castro in order for them to help in Dominic's war. Dominic goes down to Cuba and kills many of the government's dissidents to make them believe that he is on their side. After he is allowed in the presidential palace, he attempts to kill Fidel Castro with a sniper rifle. Unfortunately, he fails and an associate of Castro, Don Almeida tries to kill Dominic, but he escapes.</p><p style="">Once back in New York, Michael must escort Vincenzo Pentangelli, Frank's brother who will try to influence Frank into not testifying, to Michael's trial before the Senate Committee. Unfortunately, he is kidnapped and Dominic rescues him. He brings him to the Senate Committee and gets Frank to not reveal secrets about the family. After the Committee, it is revealed that Roth and Mitchell have gone against the family and that Fredo has unwittingly betrayed Michael to Roth. Michael then tasks Dominic with taking out the rest of the families in the three cities and killing Agent Mitchell. After killing the rest of your enemies, you are then tasked by Michael to kill Roth who is returning to America through Florida's airport. Dominic fights through security and Roth's men to take him out. When he encounters Roth, Dominic demands to know why he betrayed them, to which Roth replies that "This was the life we chose". Dominic then takes out Roth and escapes the police to the former Mangano compound where Michael congratulates him and offers him one last task. The final cutscene of the game depicts Dominic assassinating Fredo while they are fishing on Lake Tahoe.</p><h2>System Requirements</h2><h3>Minimum</h3><ul><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows XP SP2/Vista</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Pentium 4 @ 2.8 GHz/AMD Athlon64 3000+</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 1 GB for XP/2 GB for Vista</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong> 9+ GB Free</li><li><strong>Video Memory:</strong> 256 MB NVIDIA GeForce 6800 or better/ATI X1600 Pro or better</li><li><strong>Sound Card:</strong> DirectX Compatible</li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> 9.0c</li></ul><h3>Recommended</h3><ul><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows XP SP2/Vista</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Athlon64 X2 235/Intel Core 2 Duo processor Memory: 2 GB for XP/4 GB for Vista</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong> 9+ GB Free</li><li><strong>Video Memory:</strong> 256 MB NVIDIA GeForce 8500 or better/ATI RADEON HD2400 Pro or better</li><li><strong>Sound Card:</strong> DirectX Compatible</li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> 9.0c</li></ul>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>23346</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/1894710-box_gfather2.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/1894710-box_gfather2.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/1894710-box_gfather2.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/1894710-box_gfather2.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/1894710-box_gfather2.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1894710-box_gfather2.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/1894710-box_gfather2.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[The Godfather II]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>22</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-16/]]></api_detail_url><id>16</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: M]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-32/]]></api_detail_url><id>32</id><name><![CDATA[CERO: D]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-37/]]></api_detail_url><id>37</id><name><![CDATA[PEGI: 18+]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2009-04-07 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/the-godfather-ii/3030-23346/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[MP3]]></aliases><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-23398/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-08-17 13:45:22</date_added><date_last_updated>2015-03-23 07:49:16</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[The long-awaited third Max Payne game finally arrived in May 2012, courtesy of Rockstar Vancouver. Eight years after the end of Max Payne 2, an aging, burnt-out Max finds one last chance to redeem himself while working as a bodyguard for a rich family in Brazil.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">The possibility of a <a href="/max-payne-3/3030-23398/" data-ref-id="3030-23398">Max Payne 3</a> was first hinted at in the closing moments of <a href="/max-payne-2-the-fall-of-max-payne/3030-3547/" data-ref-id="3030-3547">Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne</a> with the words "Max's Journey into the Night Will Continue." Originally announced for release in 2009, the game was postponed several times before finally being released, first on consoles in North America on the 15th of May, 2012, and finally making it over to PC on the 1st of June, with releases in other areas coming slightly afterwards.</p><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22269/2142848-mp3_75.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2142848" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.0416" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:104.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22269/2142848-mp3_75.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2142848"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22269/2142848-mp3_75.jpg"></a><figcaption>Left: Timothy Gibbs. Right: The new Max Payne.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Rockstar's Vancouver studio was the lead developer, breaking the series away from its previous developer, <a href="/remedy-entertainment-ltd/3010-1961/" data-ref-id="3010-1961">Remedy Entertainment</a>. Since its announcement, the game appeared to have undergone some significant stylistic changes. Early screenshots depicted <a href="/max-payne/3005-697/" data-ref-id="3005-697">Max</a> as an older, bald man, although subsequently released screenshots showed Max with hair; while initially this was thought to be the result of the aforementioned stylistic changes, this is explained in the story arc of the game.</p><p style="">Max Payne is no longer a police officer in this new sequel. Set eight years after the previous game, Max is still addicted to booze and painkillers. Without the badge weighing him down, Payne leaves New York for São Paulo, Brazil, at the urging of a former police academy classmate, Raul Passos, and gets into the private security industry. At the game's outset, he is protecting a wealthy real estate man named Rodrigo Branco and his family. However, things drift from bad to worse as he gets double-crossed in the new city.</p><p style="">While Max still has the face and general features of actor <a href="/timothy-gibbs/3040-98134/" data-ref-id="3040-98134">Timothy Gibbs</a> as he did in <a href="/max-payne-2-the-fall-of-max-payne/3030-3547/" data-ref-id="3030-3547">Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne</a>, the new developers are slightly redesigning it to resemble <a href="/james-mccaffrey/3040-47237/" data-ref-id="3040-47237">James McCaffrey</a>, the voice actor for Max Payne in <a href="/max-payne-3/3030-23398/" data-ref-id="3030-23398">Max Payne 3</a>, and the man who has voiced Max Payne in all of his previous outings.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22269/2142944-branco.png" data-ref-id="1300-2142944" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.56152927120669" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22269/2142944-branco.png" data-ref-id="1300-2142944"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22269/2142944-branco.png"></a><figcaption>Branco Corporation</figcaption></figure><p style="">Eight years after the events of the second game, Max Payne, now retired from the NYPD, harboring a crippling addiction to alcohol and painkillers and living in Hoboken, New Jersey, is approached by former Police Academy colleague Raul Passos. Passos happens to arrive at Max's favorite bar while Max is being harassed by the son of local mob boss Anthony DeMarco, just in time to ward DeMarco Jr. and his friends out of the bar with a pistol. Passos tells Max that he has moved to South America, and is now working private security for a wealthy industrialist family, and that he has arrived in New Jersey on a recruitment drive. Max is initially unwilling, but converses with Passos longer after he offers to buy Max a drink. DeMarco and his friends return to the bar armed and looking to confront Max and Passos. An unnamed girl at the bar intervenes, shouting profanely at DeMarco Jr., who responds by smacking her in the face with his pistol. Max immediately shoots DeMarco Jr., quickly escalating into a full-blown firefight in the bar. Max and Passos are pursued by DeMarco's thugs throughout New Jersey, and finally reluctantly depart to Brazil after Max gives his last goodbyes to his wife and child at a Hoboken cemetery.</p><p style="">After some time has passed, Max and Passos are working for the Bronco family in São Paulo, Brazil, consisting of three brothers: Rodrigo, the eldest and most wealthy, operating the high-profile Bronco Corporation; Victor, a politician struggling to obtain the position of São Paulo's Mayorship; and Marcelo, the youngest and most rowdy member of the family. While standing guard in the Branco penthouse during a party, Max rescues both Rodrigo and his young trophy wife Fabiana from a street gang known as the Commando Sombra assaulting the premises. Shortly afterwards, Max accompanies Marcelo, Fabiana and her sister Giovanna (also Passos's girlfriend) to the <i>Moderno</i> nightclub in Brazil, where they are again attacked by the Commando Sombra. Max manages to save Marcelo and Giovanna, but the gang escapes with Fabiana in tow. Back at the Bronco offices, the family looks over the Commando Sombra's ransom note, demanding three million dollars for Fabiana to be returned to them. Max and Passos offer to rendezvous with the gang and make the exchange.</p><p style="">Max and Passos arrive at the São Paolo Galatians Stadium with the cash in hand, but the exchange turns sour quickly when an unknown sniper kills multiple CS gangsters on the field and grazes Max's shoulder. After Passos bandages the wound, him and Max shoot their way out of the stadium in pursuit of the CS member carrying the money, along their way discovering the third party who broke up the exchange and managed to get to the money before Max and Passos could was the Crachá Preto, a right-wing group of brutal paramilitaries with high-quality training and equipment. Learning that the CS have taken Fabiana to a hideout in the Tiéte River docks, Max and Passos attempt to assault the base and rescue Fabiana, but the boat carrying Fabiana and Commando Sombra leader Serrano escapes before the duo can do anything.</p><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/112064/2230231-maxpayne3_2012_06_07_20_49_58_43.png" data-ref-id="1300-2230231" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/112064/2230231-maxpayne3_2012_06_07_20_49_58_43.png" data-ref-id="1300-2230231"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/112064/2230231-maxpayne3_2012_06_07_20_49_58_43.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/112064/2230231-maxpayne3_2012_06_07_20_49_58_43.png"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">After a night of especially heavy drinking, Max and Passos return to the Bronco headquarters to explain the situation to an enraged Rodrigo. Armando Becker, leader of a special São Paulo police unit known as the Unidade de Forças Especiais(UFE), promises that his team will be able to get Fabiana back, if Rodrigo only agrees to give Becker his full co-operation. After Becker leaves, the Crachá Preto attack the Bronco offices, leading Max to attempt to clear the building of attackers. After a confrontation in the lobby, Max returns to find that Rodrigo's secretary is unable to open the door to his office, and that he hasn't made a sound in a long time. Max enters the office from the roof and discovers that Rodrigo has been shot through the head by an unknown assailant. After finding that the disc containing the security camera footage of Rodrigo's office has been removed, Max helps himself to Rodrigo's bottle of whiskey, and finds a bomb placed underneath his desk. After surviving the blast, Max makes his way out of the burning remains of the Bronco headquarters to the lobby, where he interrogates a mortally wounded Crachá Preto soldier, who tells him that Fabiana has been taken to a São Paolo favela, and that the group was hired not to kill Rodrigo, but to kill Max.</p><p style="">In a desperate attempt to regain control of his life, Max decides to quit his drinking and shave his head, disguising himself for another attempt to rescue Fabiana. Max meets local detective Wilson Da Silva in a favela strip club, where Da Silva shares his theory with Max about recent events. Da Silva knows that the Crachá Preto was sometimes hired by Rodrigo to clear out villages for estate developments, and that somehow, someway, the UFE and Victor are both connected to this incident, though he fears that as soon as he puts the pieces together and figures it all out, he will be killed. After fighting his way to where Fabiana is being held, Max finds Giovanna and Marcelo also being held hostage by Serrano, after being kidnapped themselves when trying to pay Fabiana's ransom. Max bursts into the room, attempting to quell the situation, but Serrano kills Fabiana and escapes with Marcelo and Giovanna in tow. As Max tries to chase them down, the UFE begin a massive raid on the village, killing many civilians and capturing even more. Max witnesses an exchange between the Crachá Preto and the UFE, dealing over a truck full of villagers kidnapped in the raid for an unknown purpose. Puzzled, Max finds Marcelo being burned in a stack of tires and Giovanna in the clutches of CP second-in-command Milo Rego. Max manages to kill Milo in a fight and escapes with Giovanna, evading the UFE officers. When Max asks Giovanna why Marcelo was killed in such a way, she says that it is a common gang-style execution, presumably to lend credence to the UFE raiding the favela.</p><p style="">After learning that Giovanna is pregnant with Passos's child, Max manages to get Giovanna through waves of attacking CP soldiers, and into the hands of Passos, who promptly leaves Max behind. Detective Da Silva picks up Max in his car, who suggests to Max that Passos may not have actually gone to Police Academy with him and that Max was possibly hired to be the violent, angry "fall guy" for any illegal business the Broncos might have been involved with. Da Silva asks Max what he really thought was going on in Panama, referring to a job he and Passos had protecting Marcelo on a yacht during a cruise in the Panama Canal. Flashing back to these events, Max remembers pirates raiding the ship and attempting to seize cargo that had since disappeared. When Max reunited with Passos and Marcelo later, they were attempting to drive off with a truck containing this unknown cargo, but Max was too drunk at the time to know or care what the item might be.</p><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/21673/2225143-maxpayne3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2225143" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.56260075228372" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/21673/2225143-maxpayne3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2225143"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/21673/2225143-maxpayne3.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/21673/2225143-maxpayne3.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Da Silva takes Max to the Imperial Palace Hotel, a condemned building that the UFE and the Crachá Preto check busloads of people into regularly, that never come out. Believing the building to be the center of the illicit operations, Da Silva sends Max inside to investigate. Max finds the building is a front for a elaborate organ harvesting business. UFE officials transport raid victims to the Hotel, where their organs are harvested, and their bodies are disposed of afterwards. Searching the building, Max discovers Serrano among the groups of victims, and refuses to defend Arthur Fischer, the plastic surgeon performing the operations from Serrano's attacks. Max finds some C4 in an armory inside the building, and sets the charges throughout the building. Max confronts Álvaro Neves(the Crachá Preto leader) on the rooftop of the hotel, and detonates the explosives, proceeding to fight the mercenaries on the rooftop of the building while it is collapsing below. Neves is about to kill Max when Passos saves his life. Passos tells Max that he was unaware of the plot to set him up, and finally escapes Brazil with Giovanna.</p><p style="">After allowing himself to be arrested by the UFE and fighting his way through the unit's offices, Max finally discovers that Becker's second-in-command was the one that killed Rodrigo and subsequently removed the security camera footage, and that in an attempt to get more money to fund his political campaign, Victor got the UFE to kill Rodrigo so he could inherit more money, and organized the organ trafficking as another source of income for his campaign. Victor also hired the Crachá Preto to ambush the ransom exchange and to retrieve the money, which helped to fund the organ trade.</p><p style="">Victor is escorted to a São Paulo airport by Becker and the UFE, and Max pursues the conspirators. Making his way to the runway, Max tears through Becker's group of soldiers and horrifically disfigures Becker by shooting an airborne grenade of the air, propelling Becker on to the tarmac. As Max silently approaches Becker's quickly failing figure, and prepares to execute him, he reflects on the real reason as to why he was brought to Brazil, and positions that he truly has become the violent, angry, mindless killer that the Broncos wanted him to be. The player then has the choice to shoot Becker or allow himself to bleed out and die from his injuries. With Victor's plane on the runway and ready for takeoff, Da Silva arrives to pick up Max and give chase to the plane. Grabbing Becker's grenade launcher, Max destroys multiple UFE vehicles while standing out of the sunroof of Da Silva's car. Successfully stopping Victor's plane, Max rushes out of the car to kill Victor, hobbling from the wreckage of the jet. Max is about to shoot Victor when Da Silva pleads with Max to let him suffer through prison and a trial. Max decides to let Victor live as per Da Silva's advice. Victor laughs at Max, declaring: "You know I'll walk", claiming that his connections will allow him to beat any charges leveled against him. Max, angrily says: "You'll walk...with a limp." stomping Victor's leg, leaving it severely damaged and the man writhing on the ground in pain as the authorities arrive on the scene.</p><p style="">After a week has passed, Max is on a beach in Bahia, enjoying a beer (and only a single beer at that, instead of his characteristic full bottle of whiskey), watching the news of the aftermath of Victor's scandal. The UFE's human trafficking business has been uncovered, and the unit disbanded. Victor Bronco is charged with laundering money from the ring to fund his campaign, and has recently been found hung in his police cell, the news reporter stating it being unknown whether or not the death was a suicide or "retribution". Max begins to leave, walking into the sunset to enjoy his vacation and presumably start anew in his life.</p><h2>Characters and Factions</h2><ul><li>Max Payne: Formerly an undercover DEA Agent and NYPD Detective, Max has since given up on protecting and serving New York's civilian population. Drunk most nights and addicted to painkillers, Max has retreated to Hoboken in New Jersey, content to whittle away the remaining years of his life in a local bar. Until, one night, he is approached by Raul Passos, a former police academy colleague, with an available bodyguard position for a wealthy Brazillian family, a position Max reluctantly takes hoping for a fresh start in life.</li><li>Rodrigo Branco: Wealthy 51 year old estate man from São Paulo.</li><li>Fabiana Branco: Rodrigo's Trophy wife. Much younger than her husband, Fabiana is known as a weathy socialite, a common sight at Sao Paulo's Nightclub scene as well as the front pages of its tabloids.</li><li>Marcelo Branco: Rodrigo's younger brother. Similar to Rodrigo's wife in age and disposition, Marcelo is young, wild, and reckless. He spends much of his time with Fabiana, living it up in the Brazillian night life.</li><li>Victor Branco: Rodrigo's younger brother. Dissimilar to the freewheeling Marcelo, Victor is a local politician. Positioned as the truth and justice candidate in the race for Brazil's Mayorship, Victor is willing to do whatever it takes to win a race he is losing at the outset of the game.</li><li>Raul Passos: Security head for Rodrigo and Max's partner</li><li>Comando Sombra: Brazillian street gang based on the Tiete river and the Nova Esperanca favela. Over the course of the game, they make two kidnapping attempts against the Branco family, successfully taking Fabiana at a nightclub after being thwarted by Max and Raul at the Branco's party.</li><li>Serrano: Leader of Comando Sombra</li><li>Crachá Preto: Right-wing PMC for hire.

Da Silva arrives, along with local police, at the conclusion of the Branco's Penthouse party to restore order. However, unlike UFE, Da Silva heads up an investigation into the illicit dealings and activites of UFE, Becker, and Victor Branco becoming Max's only ally. An honest cop in a corrupt town, Da Silva is unable to use the evidence he has collected without being killed forcing him to rely on Max.</li></ul><h2>Story Chapters</h2><ol><li>Something Rotten in the Air</li><li>Nothing But the Second Best</li><li>Just Another Day at the Office</li><li>Anybody Can Buy Me a Drink</li><li>Alive If Not Exactly Well</li><li>A Dame, a Dork, and a Drunk</li><li>A Hangover Sent Direct from Mother Nature</li><li>Ain't No Reprievement Gonna Be Found Otherwise</li><li>Here I Was Again, Halfway Down the World</li><li>It's Drive or Shoot, Sister</li><li>Sun Tan Oil, Stale Margaritas, and Greed</li><li>The Great American Savior of the Poor</li><li>A Fat Bald Dude With a Bad Temper</li><li>One Card Left to Play</li></ol><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Health and Cover</h3><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22269/2142950-cover.png" data-ref-id="1300-2142950" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.55880597014925" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:55.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22269/2142950-cover.png" data-ref-id="1300-2142950"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22269/2142950-cover.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22269/2142950-cover.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Taking cover to swallow painkillers</figcaption></figure><p style="">In keeping with series staples, the healing system features Max's familiar addiction to painkillers and does not include regenerating health. The painkillers can be found in medicine cabinets scattered throughout the game and can carried for later use. Therefore, taking cover can only be used as a mechanic to shield Max during a firefight, reload the weapons or to swallow some painkillers, rather than a long break to await the familiar "bloody screen" representing damage to dissipate and Max's health to regenerate, as is common in modern shooters.</p><h3>Weapons</h3><p style="">Max's weapon inventory has been modified, and he may now only carry two pistols and one two handed weapon. He can now dual wield two different small weapons at the same time, such as a pistol and an uzi, whereas before he could only dual-wield two of the same weapon at once. When not in use, Max's two-handed weapon is held in his off hand. In order to dual wield, he must drop his two-handed weapon.</p><p style="">The game's weapons feature an array of pistols and compact submachine guns, to sawed-off shotguns, sniper rifles, pump-action shotguns, assault rifles, full size sub machine guns, and grenade and rocket launchers launchers.</p><h3>Bullet-time, Shootdodging and Last Man Standing</h3><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22269/2142856-sd.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2142856" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.61640625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:61.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22269/2142856-sd.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2142856"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22269/2142856-sd.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22269/2142856-sd.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Backward Shootdodge</figcaption></figure><p style="">The game is staying true to its roots by featuring the iconic Max Payne Bullet Time mode with its special mechanics during shootouts.</p><p style="">Bullet Time can be used in two ways: Either activated to slow down time and move, jump or shoot in slow motion, or it can be triggered by performing a shootdodge - a leap (in any direction) that engages bullet-time and lets him aim freely while sailing through the air in slow motion. Although unlike Max Payne 2, once Bullet Time is activated, Max will move as slow as the world around him as opposed to the super human speed gifted in the former.</p><p style="">Also unlike the previous games, performing a shootdodge will keep Max prone after hitting the ground, a bonus that allows the player to keep shooting in a 360 degree direction while being harder to hit.</p><p style="">Shootdodging direction can be altered mid-air by the player, allowing Max to avoid barriers and walls which could cause him to take health damage. Landing on dead bodies decreases the damage taken from high shootdodge falls.</p><p style="">Shootdoding into objects (walls, chairs etc.) will cause the Bullet Time to stop.</p><p style="">Last Man Standing is a new feature which is basically a lifeline to the player. If you’re mortally shot, time slows and the reticle quickly draws back to the enemy who shot you, offering you one last chance to shoot him to revive yourself. Last Man Standing only triggers if Max has painkillers on hand; if you successfully kill the enemy, Max survives the fatal shot and regenerates the health equivalent of a pain killer. This uses a painkiller and depletes Max's bullet time meter.</p><h3>Killcam</h3><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22269/2142952-bullet.png" data-ref-id="1300-2142952" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.56453558504222" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22269/2142952-bullet.png" data-ref-id="1300-2142952"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22269/2142952-bullet.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22269/2142952-bullet.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Killcam showing the last bullets on their way to the last standing enemy.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Similar to the killcam of the first two games, the killcam in Max Payne 3 is triggered when the player shoots the last living enemy in a given room or area. The killcam can either be watched as a dramatic slow-motion video showing the bullets penetrating the affected enemy, or it can be used as a Bullet Time sequence where the player can slow down time, shoot the bullets and watch them penetrate that enemy and cause his body to react to the impact with precise animations.</p><p style="">This will be the only available killcam in the game, and sniper rifles will not have the bullet camera presented in the previous games which followed every sniper bullet fired until it reached its destination.</p><h3>HUD</h3><p style="">The same HUD returns from the old games, showing a Bullet Time meter which is depleted when used and regenerates when Max kills enemies, a white silhouette of Max which fills red when taken damage, and the number of available painkillers inside the portrait.</p><ul><li>Max's partner Raul Passos accompanies him in some of the game's levels as a companion NPC, watching Max's back and playing key roles in some of the game's levels and sequences.</li><li>Certain objects are now destructible.</li><li>A variety of team-based and deathmatch style multiplayer modes are available.</li></ul><h2>Comic Book Series</h2><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22269/2303290-comics_issue1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2303290" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.5405405405405" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:154.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22269/2303290-comics_issue1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2303290"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22269/2303290-comics_issue1.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22269/2303290-comics_issue1.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Max Payne 3 writer <a href="/dan-houser/3040-16219/" data-ref-id="3040-16219">Dan Houser</a> wrote a 3-part comic book series with the help of <a href="/remedy/3030-6098/" data-ref-id="3030-6098">Remedy</a>'s own <a href="/sami-jarvi/3040-47155/" data-ref-id="3040-47155">Sam Lake</a>, and released via Marvel Custom Solutions.</p><p style="">The series explores the major events in Max's troubled life from childhood, through the first two games, and up until the third game.</p><ul><li>Issue #1: After the Fall - The first issue which was released on May 4th 2012, 11 days before the game release, deals with Max's relationship with women and how he is overly protective of them because of the death of his mother as a child and wife as a married adult.</li><li>Issue #2: Hoboken Blues - Released on June 12th, this part tells the story of Max and his late wife Michelle, the loss of his DEA friend Alex Balder, and how the condition of New York City deteriorated with the overflow of drugs in the streets.</li><li>Issue #3: Fight and Flight - Released on July 13th, this third and last part of the series shows us Max's first meeting with his partner-to-be Passos in the bar, and how he killed the rich kid who threatened him.

It's almost like being a game previewer</i>"</p><p style="">"<i>It's almost like you have a writer, you know, who's written a book, and he's in the process of editing it and he gives it to another writer to read and, you know, we'll give feedback. I think creative people are great that way that they're collaborative and they're very open.</i> "</p><p style="">According to Myllyrinne, quite a few Remedy personnel who worked on the first two games were involved in providing this feedback to Rockstar, such as the Art Director from both games, the Project Lead from MP2, the Senior Gameplay Designers, Senior Technical Artists, Lead Programmer, Creative Director Sam Lake and Himself.</p><h3>Remedy's Take on The New Max</h3><p style="">Sam Lake explained the changes in Max's morale and looks by saying that being as lost and devastated as he was, Max needed to do anything to regain control of his life, which caused him to do this ritualistic act of shaving his head and get back in control again, turning from a punching bag to someone who delivers punches.</p><h3>The New Location</h3><p style="">According to Myllyrinne, São Paulo greatly parallels New York with its slick office buildings, testaments to corporate entities (Aesir Corporation in New York versus the Branco Corporation in São Paulo), as well as having the low-end, dodgy neighborhoods with the crackhouses and rooftops of New York being paralleled by the poor crowded Favelas of São Paulo.</p><p style="">Lake adds that Max as a character is lost in his life, which justifies his moving to another, unfamiliar environment where he feels like a fish out of the water. The alien surroundings fit what the character is going through perfectly, he says.</p><h2>Special Edition</h2><p style="">As well as the regular retail disc, Rockstar also released a limited Special Edition version of Max Payne 3, this included:</p><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118833/2212199-maxpayne3_specialedition_large0111212011.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2212199" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.76851851851852" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:76.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118833/2212199-maxpayne3_specialedition_large0111212011.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2212199"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118833/2212199-maxpayne3_specialedition_large0111212011.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118833/2212199-maxpayne3_specialedition_large0111212011.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><ul><li>A copy of Max Payne 3;</li><li>10” tall Collectible Max Payne Statue created in a collaboration between TriForce and Rockstar Games;</li><li>Original Still Life Art Prints that depict some of Max Payne’s inner demons and vices;</li><li>Copper and brass-plated iron, Bullet Keychain;</li><li>Classic Multiplayer Character Pack of eight playable multiplayer characters for Max Payne 3 Multiplayer;</li><li>Disorderly Conduct Multiplayer Weapons Pack for Max Payne 3 Multiplayer;</li><li>Downloadable Max Payne 3 Official Soundtrack</li></ul><h2>Soundtrack</h2><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/17/171291/2465300-mp3os.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2465300" data-ratio="1" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/17/171291/2465300-mp3os.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2465300"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/17/171291/2465300-mp3os.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/17/171291/2465300-mp3os.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Max Payne 3 official soundtrack cover.</figcaption></figure><p style=""> </p><p style="">HEALTH band composes 26 soundtrack plus an additional special bonus track by Emicida titled "9 Circulos."

The game was developed by London-based <a data-ref-id="3010-1214" href="/headstrong-games/3010-1214/" slug="headstrong-games">Headstrong Games</a> after the success of Sega's Wii ports of Ghost Squad and House of the Dead 2 &amp; 3 Return.</p><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22263/783014-house_of_the_dead__overkill_nintendo_wiiscreenshots15522overkill_hospital2_311008.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-783014" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.69140625" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:69.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22263/783014-house_of_the_dead__overkill_nintendo_wiiscreenshots15522overkill_hospital2_311008.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-783014"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22263/783014-house_of_the_dead__overkill_nintendo_wiiscreenshots15522overkill_hospital2_311008.jpg"></a><figcaption>"The hardcore you've been waiting for!"</figcaption></figure><p style="">But while the game has new gameplay mechanics and a new developer, the most important change of all is the game's tone. The House of the Dead franchise is no stranger to humor; previous entries have become cult favorites, be it for <a data-ref-id="1100-818" href="/good-voice-work-a-tribute-to-goldman/1100-818/" slug="good-voice-work-a-tribute-to-goldman">comically bad voice acting</a> or <a data-ref-id="3030-616" href="/the-typing-of-the-dead/3030-616/" slug="the-typing-of-the-dead">bizarre visual gags and surreal gameplay</a>. OVERKILL, instead, follows in the footsteps of Quentin Tarintino &amp; Robert Rodriguez's <i><a data-ref-id="3015-2830" href="/grindhouse/3015-2830/" slug="grindhouse">Grindhouse</a></i> and emulates the vibe of American B-horror and exploitation films from the 1970s (many of which were, ironically, only obtainable through illegal channels in England - where developer Headstrong Games is based - after being classified as "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_nasty" rel="nofollow">video nasties</a>" and banned). As such, the game revels in intentionally cheesy acting, cutscenes with poor editing and visual gaffes, a funk-influenced soundtrack, hyper-sexualized femme fatales, massive amounts of violence, and expletives. Lots and lots of expletives.</p><p style="">House of the Dead: OVERKILL is formerly the Guinness World Record holder for the most profane video game of all time, with the word "fuck" appearing 189 times in the game's script. It has since relinquished this title to <a data-ref-id="3010-6511" href="/2k-czech/3010-6511/" slug="2k-czech">2K Czech</a>'s <a data-ref-id="3030-20538" href="/mafia-ii/3030-20538/" slug="mafia-ii">Mafia II</a>.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22263/783015-house_of_the_dead__overkill_nintendo_wiiscreenshots15523overkill_hospital3_311008.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-783015" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.69140625" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:69.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22263/783015-house_of_the_dead__overkill_nintendo_wiiscreenshots15523overkill_hospital3_311008.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-783015"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22263/783015-house_of_the_dead__overkill_nintendo_wiiscreenshots15523overkill_hospital3_311008.jpg"></a><figcaption>It's a zombie nurse! I think you know what to do.</figcaption></figure><p style="">OVERKILL features the same on-rails gameplay as previous games in the series, but also adds new features and slight tweaks to the formula not seen in previous House of the Dead titles. For one, the player can now choose between a selection of guns and customize their loadout, whereas previous games in the series limited the player to one type of gun. Before beginning a chapter, the player must choose two guns to carry (though can only carry one if they choose), and can switch between said guns at any time by pressing the 1 or 2 buttons on the Wii Remote. New guns can be purchased from the "Gun Shop" screen before each chapter using cash obtained by completing chapters and in-game challenges and achievements, and these points can also be used to upgrade these guns and increase their various stats (see the "Weapons" section for more information).</p><p style="">Furthermore, the player has limited control of their field of vision, and is able to moderately pan or tilt the camera by moving the cursor towards the edge of the screen; this can be used to find hidden items or to get a better shot on enemy zombies. The game also brings back House of the Dead 4's contextual melee attack that forces the player to shake the Wii Remote to knock back certain enemies that can grab the player before they can do too much damage.</p><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/882866-g.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-882866" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.4925373134328" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:149.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/882866-g.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-882866"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/27/882866-g.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/27/882866-g.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>"They call him only 'G.' His identity, a mystery."</figcaption></figure><p style="">As the game is the first mainline House of the Dead title not to see an arcade release, it also tweaks elements of the health, scoring, and continue systems to make the game more friendly to console-gaming standards. Instead of giving the player a finite number of lives that can be increased by finding hidden health boosts or saving civilians, the player is given a ten-segmented health bar that shrinks as they take damage. Finite continues, too, are done away with, as the player is able to continue at any time at the cost of half of their score when playing Story mode. Finally, OVERKILL adds a combo system that awards the player bonus points and multipliers for consecutive hits, with bonus points awarded for headshots; like comparable combo systems, the combo is lost as soon as the player misses a shot.</p><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/882869-washington.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-882869" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.4925373134328" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:149.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/882869-washington.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-882869"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/27/882869-washington.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/27/882869-washington.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>"Detective Isaac Washington - make him mad, and he'll rip your balls off."</figcaption></figure><p style="">Finally, OVERKILL features elements of The House of the Dead 2's item collection system. In addition to the requisite health packs that replenish two sections of the player's health bar if shot, the player can collect golden brains strewn throughout the levels that unlock bonus points and in-game achievements if all are collected. On the offensive side, OVERKILL features an item that briefly engages a <a data-ref-id="3015-78" href="/bullet-time/3015-78/" slug="bullet-time">bullet time-style mode</a> (humorously titled: "Slow Mo-Fo") and grenades that can be thrown by pressing the Minus button on the Wii Remote.</p><p style="">Other than that, OVERKILL is pretty much like any other game in the series - shoot monsters, save civilians, fight bosses, watch ridiculous cutscenes, you know the drill.</p><p style="">Upon finishing the Story mode, the player unlocks Director's Cut mode, in which the levels are longer and contain new areas and extra enemies and continues are limited. Completing this mode unlocks a Dual Wield mode <i>a la</i> Raw Thrill's <i>Target: Terror</i>.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style="">OVERKILL is a prequel to the rest of the main-series games. Set in 1991, seven years before the events of <a data-ref-id="3030-508" href="/the-house-of-the-dead/3030-508/" slug="the-house-of-the-dead">the first game</a>, players assume the role of <a data-ref-id="3005-8710" href="/agent-g/3005-8710/" slug="agent-g">Special Agent G</a>, a rookie fresh out of the AMS academy working on his first case. G is sent to investigate a small town in Louisiana named Bayou City and apprehend <a data-ref-id="3005-9580" href="/papa-caesar/3005-9580/" slug="papa-caesar">Papa Caesar</a>, a ruthless criminal who has been experimenting with a mutant formula. There, he meets <a data-ref-id="3005-8711" href="/isaac-washington/3005-8711/" slug="isaac-washington">Detective Isaac Washington</a>, a local cop who plays by his own rules. The fictional backwater swamp town is infested with mutants, and it is up to these two to resolve the situation and bring the man behind the madness to justice.</p><p style="">The game is broken up into seven "features," each beginning with their own "trailer." The story for each chapter is as follows:</p><h3>Papa's Palace of Pain</h3><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1817/1359519-862728_papa_poster_super.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1359519" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.70666666666667" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:70.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1817/1359519-862728_papa_poster_super.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1359519"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1817/1359519-862728_papa_poster_super.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1817/1359519-862728_papa_poster_super.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>"Be a courteous guest... because your first visit will be your last!"</figcaption></figure><p style="">Agent G and Isaac Washington meet as adversaries outside of Papa Caesar's mansion; G has come on behalf of AMS to arrest Papa Caesar "by the book," while Issac, seeking revenge on Papa Caesar for murdering his father, has his own plans. The mutant outbreak forces the duo to reconsider their antagonistic relationship, if only for a few hours. The unlikely allies fight their way through Papa Caesar's mutant-infested mansion, eventually making their way to his lab in the cellar. There, G and Isaac stumble upon Papa Caesar and his crippled paraplegic assistant <a data-ref-id="3005-9846" href="/jasper-guns/3005-9846/" slug="jasper-guns">Jasper</a>. Jasper, being forced to work for Caesar in order to keep him from attacking his sister, injects himself with the "zombie" virus he worked on in order to regain mobility over his crippled body and kill Caesar. However, Caesar manages to escape, leaving Jasper to attack G and Isaac in his mutated form. After wearing Jasper down, G "helps" him ease his pain by putting a bullet in his brain. Just then, <a data-ref-id="3005-9845" href="/varla-guns/3005-9845/" slug="varla-guns">Varla Guns</a>, Jasper's sister who was forced to become an <a data-ref-id="3015-2080" href="/strippers/3015-2080/" slug="strippers">erotic dancer</a> after their parents' death to help take care of her crippled brother, runs into the room. Upon seeing Jasper's dead, mutated corpse lying on the floor, she vows to avenge her brother and kill Papa Caesar before running off again. G and Isaac, meanwhile, give chase in G's car (on account of Isaac's car mysteriously exploding as they approach it).</p><h3>Ballistic Trauma</h3><p style="">G and Isaac follow Caesar to the hospital deep in the heart of Bayou City, which has become overrun by mutants. After fighting their way through the ravaged hospital and disposing of the hideous Screamer, Caesar's mutant designed specifically to dispose of G and Isaac, a phone starts ringing... from inside the fallen enemy's stomach. Isaac forces G to retrieve the phone (not wanting to ruin his manicure), who answers the phone before giving it to his partner, telling him: "it's for you." Papa Caesar's is on the other end, revealing that he is about to detonate the hospital that they are in. Upon this announcement G and Isaac sprint away from the hospital as fast as they can.</p><p style="">Outside the hospital, the duo reunite with Varla. With G's car having just been miraculously blown up, the three of them decide to go on the pursuit of Papa Cesar together on Varla's mother cycle, with Varla driving, G sitting behind her and Isaac cramped up in the tiny sidecar.</p><h3>Carny</h3><p style="">After barely avoiding an accident, the trio briefly stop outside a carnival on the outskirts of town. Left without transport after Varla ditches them, G and Isaac are forced to fight their way through the infected carnival to find a new ride. But what they end up finding is not quite what Detective Washington has in mind, as the duo, after finishing off the (further) mutated conjoined twins <a data-ref-id="3005-10304" href="/the-twins-nigel-and-sebastian/3005-10304/" slug="the-twins-nigel-and-sebastian">Nigel and Sebastian</a>, continue their trek in a commandeered <a data-ref-id="3055-1910" href="/ice-cream-truck/3055-1910/" slug="ice-cream-truck">ice cream truck</a>, where they proceed to have an argument about the merits of country music versus funk.</p><h3>Scream Train</h3><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/882862-scream_train_poster.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-882862" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.7064606741573" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:70.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/882862-scream_train_poster.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-882862"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/27/882862-scream_train_poster.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/27/882862-scream_train_poster.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>"200 tons of unstoppable terror burning through the night!"</figcaption></figure><p style="">G and Washington reach the train station, where they find Varla about to shoot Caesar. Isaac wants to kill Caesar himself, but G insists they allow him to take Caesar into custody. While the trio bicker, Caesar makes his escape, climbing aboard a train. G and Isaac follow him on, leaving Varla behind. Like many vehicles the two come in contact with, the train crashes and explodes as the chapter ends, though Caesar manages to escape.</p><h3>The Fetid Waters</h3><p style="">Some time later, Varla finds the two unconscious in the swamp. Suddenly, Caesar appears out of the blue pointing a gun at Varla and forces her onto her motorcycle. Caesar tells Isaac that he is truly like his father, saying that he has once again missed his chance for revenge. He then throws a cassette at Isaac's feet; Isaac asks if it was true that Caesar killed his father, but Caesar does not answer and instead tells Varla to bring him to the County Prison. Varla tells them that they had better come and rescue her and then rides off with Caesar holding her at gunpoint in the passenger seat. Isaac points out to G that the quickest way to get there is through the swamps and heads off in front; G picks up Caesar's cassette and then follows.</p><h3>Jailhouse Judgement</h3><p style="">Once they arrive at the County Prison, they meet Clement Darling, the prison's eccentric warden. After fighting their way through the prison, G and Washington find Clement, Varla and Caesar in the basement, the latter two strapped to electric chairs. Clement reveals that he was responsible for the mutant outbreak, and used Caesar to get the compound. He then introduces his loudmouthed, abusive mother (with whom he shares a relationship so intimate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus_complex" rel="nofollow">it would make Freud's head hurt</a>), whose life he wishes to sustain using the mutant compound. After his mother causes a fuss about the size of Varla's breasts, Clement electrocutes Caesar, robbing Isaac of his chance for revenge. He then departs with Varla.</p><h3>Overkill</h3><p style="">Armed to the teeth and seeking retribution, G and Issac blast their way through the secret lab beneath the prison. They hear Varla screaming in terror over a speaker, giving them further reason to press forward. After fighting their way through the lab, they discover Clement and Varla, whose brain has been removed and replaced with that of Clement's mother. With no other choice, G and Issac shoot "Varla" into a vat of the mutant formula, transforming her into a hideous, gargantuan monstrosity with sagging breasts and a long uterus-like appendage. G and Isaac find some miniguns and defeat the monster. Clement wishes to atone for his sins and asks Isaac and G to allow him to "return to the source." G consents, and Clement heads of to be "reborn..." by crawling inside his monster mother's vagina to curl up inside her womb and die. As G notes that Isaac never once called Clement a "motherfucker" despite throwing the term around with reckless abandon throughout the rest of the game (and Clement actually being a "motherfucker"), he (carrying Varla's brain in a jar) and Isaac escape in a helicopter, while Isaac reflects over how the events of the game were an indictment of contemporary feminism. As they fly off into the sunset and a "beautiful friendship" begins, the credits roll and the song "Suffer Like G Did," in which G reflects on the case with his mother and tells her about his new girlfriend (obviously Varla's brain) plays.</p><p style="">After the credits, the contents of Papa Caesar's cassette are revealed, giving an ominous message about the future of the mutant formula and revealing that Isaac's father is still alive.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><p style="">House of the Dead: OVERKILL features seven different weapons that can be purchased, upgraded, and assigned to the two available weapon slots per level. Each weapon features five attributes:</p><ul><li>Recoil - determines the amount of kickback and how steadily the player can aim.</li><li>Fire rate - determines how fast the player can fire.</li><li>Clip size - determines how many bullets the gun can hold before needing to be reloaded.</li><li>Damage - determines how much damage each shot will do.</li><li>Reload - determines how quickly the player can reload.</li></ul><p style="">These attribute are rated Gold, Silver or Bronze (Gold being the best and Bronze being the worst). The player can spend the cash earned from completing levels and achievements to upgrade these attributes, though some weapons will come pre-loaded with upgrades. The seven weapons are:</p><h3>AMS Magnum</h3><ul><li>The standard issue pistol.</li><li>Unlocked from the start of the game.</li><li><table class="t-editor with-border full-width"><tbody><tr><th>Attribute</th><th>Starting Level</th></tr><tr><td>Recoil</td><td>Bronze</td></tr><tr><td>Fire rate</td><td>Silver</td></tr><tr><td>Clip size</td><td>Bronze</td></tr><tr><td>Damage</td><td>Bronze</td></tr><tr><td>Reload</td><td>Bronze</td></tr></tbody></table></li></ul><h3>Shotgun</h3><ul><li>A pump-action shotgun.</li><li>Purchase Price: $1,800</li><li><table class="t-editor with-border full-width"><tbody><tr><th>Attribute</th><th>Starting Level</th></tr><tr><td>Recoil</td><td>Bronze</td></tr><tr><td>Fire rate</td><td>Bronze</td></tr><tr><td>Clip size</td><td>Bronze</td></tr><tr><td>Damage</td><td>Bronze</td></tr><tr><td>Reload</td><td>Bronze</td></tr></tbody></table></li></ul><h3>Automatic Shotgun</h3><ul><li>A quick-reloading combat shotgun with a large rate-of-fire and blast radius.</li><li>Purchase Price: $6,500</li><li><table class="t-editor with-border full-width"><tbody><tr><th>Attribute</th><th>Starting Level</th></tr><tr><td>Recoil</td><td>Bronze</td></tr><tr><td>Fire rate</td><td>Gold</td></tr><tr><td>Clip size</td><td>Bronze</td></tr><tr><td>Damage</td><td>Silver</td></tr><tr><td>Reload</td><td>Bronze</td></tr></tbody></table></li></ul><h3>SMG</h3><ul><li>A submachine gun with a low barrier of entry and lightning-fast fire rate.</li><li>Purchase Price: $1,225</li><li><table class="t-editor with-border full-width"><tbody><tr><th>Attribute</th><th>Starting Level</th></tr><tr><td>Recoil</td><td>Bronze</td></tr><tr><td>Fire rate</td><td>Gold</td></tr><tr><td>Clip size</td><td>Silver</td></tr><tr><td>Damage</td><td>Bronze</td></tr><tr><td>Reload</td><td>Bronze</td></tr></tbody></table></li></ul><h3>Assault Rifle</h3><ul><li>A rifle that mows mutants down when the SMG won't cut it.</li><li>Purchase Price: $4,600</li><li><table class="t-editor with-border full-width"><tbody><tr><th>Attribute</th><th>Starting Level</th></tr><tr><td>Recoil</td><td>Bronze</td></tr><tr><td>Fire rate</td><td>Gold</td></tr><tr><td>Clip size</td><td>Silver</td></tr><tr><td>Damage</td><td>Silver</td></tr><tr><td>Reload</td><td>Bronze</td></tr></tbody></table></li></ul><h3>Hand Cannon</h3><ul><li>A Dirty Harry-style magnum that packs a devastating punch.</li><li>Purchase Price: $5,500</li><li>Can only be purchased after completing the game on Story mode.</li><li><table class="t-editor with-border full-width"><tbody><tr><th>Attribute</th><th>Starting Level</th></tr><tr><td>Recoil</td><td>Bronze</td></tr><tr><td>Fire rate</td><td>Bronze</td></tr><tr><td>Clip size</td><td>Bronze</td></tr><tr><td>Damage</td><td>Gold</td></tr><tr><td>Reload</td><td>Bronze</td></tr></tbody></table></li></ul><h3>Minigun</h3><ul><li>The minigun used to fight the final boss.

There are twelve unique vocal tracks in the game--some of which contain lyrics in addition to random voice clips from the game, and all of which can be unlocked and played at will in the game's jukebox--with seven of them featuring both an instrumental and arranged version (the former unlocked by beating a level in Story Mode, the latter unlocked by beating a level in Director's Cut mode).

The comic stars game protagonists Isaac Washington and Varla Guns and tells of the events shortly before the first level of the game, giving the reader a glimpse into the average day of the playboy cop and devoted sister/apathetic erotic dancer as the mutant outbreak slowly begins. The comic, like Frank Miller's <i>Sin City</i>, is black and white (and filled with nudity and profanity, albeit censored in <i>Prelude</i>) with red used to highlight blood. While North American preorderers were given the comic with the game, the game and comic were packaged together in PAL territories in an exclusive, specially-designed slipcase. Copies of "Prelude to an Overkill" were also handed out to visitors of Sega's booth at New York Comic Con '09, where OVERKILL, in addition to other Wii-exclusive games, was on display.</p><h3>The Hand Cannon</h3><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/498/862638-nwhotdokb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-862638" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.82935153583618" data-width="293" style="width: 293px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:82.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/498/862638-nwhotdokb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-862638"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/498/862638-nwhotdokb.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/498/862638-nwhotdokb.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Australia-exclusive Bang Bang Box</figcaption></figure><p style="">Produced by French game publisher and peripheral developer BigBen Interactive in cooperation with Sega of Europe, the <b>Hand Cannon</b> is a revolver-shaped Wii Remote shell modeled after the game's eponymous unlockable gun that was released alongside OVERKILL. Much like Nyko's <a href="http://www.nyko.com/nyko/products/?i=124" rel="nofollow">Wii PerfectShot</a>, the Wii Remote fits into the top of the Hand Cannon and is locked into place by guards at the top and bottom of the controller. A button on the left side of the shell (near the top of the handle) opens a hatch that can be opened to make loading and unloading the Wii Remote easier, as well as store the connector for the Nunchuk; the Nunchuk wire feeds through a small hole by the shell's "hammer," and can be placed into a grooved opening down the center of the gun handle. The Hand Cannon was exclusive to PAL territories (i.e., Europe and Australia) and usually sold separately from the game, though a bundle released only in Australia (shown left) packaged the game with two Hand Cannon controller shells, whilst in Europe only one shell was available per box.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>23425</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/3/39063/1379470-houseofthedeadoverkillcover.gif]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/39063/1379470-houseofthedeadoverkillcover.gif]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/3/39063/1379470-houseofthedeadoverkillcover.gif]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/39063/1379470-houseofthedeadoverkillcover.gif]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/3/39063/1379470-houseofthedeadoverkillcover.gif]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/3/39063/1379470-houseofthedeadoverkillcover.gif]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/3/39063/1379470-houseofthedeadoverkillcover.gif]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[The House of the Dead: OVERKILL]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>14</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-12/]]></api_detail_url><id>12</id><name><![CDATA[OFLC: MA15+]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-17/]]></api_detail_url><id>17</id><name><![CDATA[BBFC: 18]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-16/]]></api_detail_url><id>16</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: M]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-32/]]></api_detail_url><id>32</id><name><![CDATA[CERO: D]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2009-02-17 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-36/]]></api_detail_url><id>36</id><name><![CDATA[Wii]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/wii/3045-36/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[Wii]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-88/]]></api_detail_url><id>88</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation Network (PS3)]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-network-ps3/3045-88/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3N]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/the-house-of-the-dead-overkill/3030-23425/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-23461/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-08-20 09:11:21</date_added><date_last_updated>2015-01-05 16:52:04</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[Fuel is an open-world racing game featuring 5,000-plus miles of open road and drastic weather like tornados and blizzards.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style=""><i>Fuel </i>is an open world racing game that's claim to fame is that it hold the Guiness world record for largest race enviornment. The game takes place in an alternate history version of the present where global warming has caused various natural disaster to transform the landscape dramatically. As such fuel in this world has become scarce and is used as currency.</p><p style="">In addition to the career mode the game also allows players to create their own races anywhere in the wasteland and race online with friends.</p><h2>Game Play:</h2><p style="">The game is an open world racer containing 5,00 miles of terrain. The world is split up into several zones most of which require stars to unlock. In each zone players start out at a base camp from where they can freely roam around searching for challenges and collectibles. The main goal in the game is to complete career races which earn the player stars. Each race has three difficulty levels and completing each grants players a separate star. To enter most races players usually need a specific vehicle which they have to buy using fuel. Fuel can be won from completing either career races or challenges. Challenges are for the most part, similar to career races although completing them does not get the player any stars, only fuel. Like career races most challenges require certain vehicles although challenges are more plentiful than career races so chances are better that players will be able to find a challenge that they can qualify for.</p><p style="">Since the world is so large the game makes a couple of concessions to help players navigate through. Career races, for instance, do not have to be found on the map, and can be selected from the Base camp menu immediately upon unlocking a zone. Furthermore, the game contains helicopter pads throughout where players can fast travel too. Challenges however do need to be discovered in free roam mode before becoming selective.</p><h2>PC System Requirements</h2><ul><li><b>OS:</b> Windows Vista (Service Pack 1) / Windows XP (Service Pack 3)</li><li><b>Processor:</b> Pentium D @ 3.0GHz or equivalent Athlon 64 X2 CPU</li><li><b>Memory:</b> 1GB RAM</li><li><b>Graphics:</b> GeForce 7800 / Radeon X1800 with 256 MB of VRAM</li><li><b>DirectX®:</b> DirectX 9.0c</li><li><b>Hard Drive:</b> 6GB Hard Drive space</li><li><b>Sound:</b> DirectX Compatible Sound Card</li></ul><p style="">Initial activation requires internet connection; Online play requires log-in to Games for Windows - LIVE; software installations required including Sony DADC SecuROM, Games for Windows - LIVE.

EyePet simulates a family pet on the screen which players can interact with in various ways. The game was released in Europe &amp; Australia in October of 2009, but was delayed for North America release so that the developers could integrate the <a data-ref-id="3015-4669" href="/playstation-move/3015-4669/" slug="playstation-move">PlayStation Move</a> motion controls and 3D technology. This Move Edition of the game is planned for release world-wide in September 2010.<br/><br/> <h2>Gameplay </h2> During the game, the screen will display the video feed from the PlayStation Eye. The EyePet character is overlaid on top of the feed allowing him to interact with real people &amp; objects.  <br/>  <br/> <figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/41471/1120533-5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1120533" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/41471/1120533-5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1120533"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/41471/1120533-5.jpg"></a><figcaption>Using the card to take an x-ray</figcaption></figure>In the original European version of the game, the menu is accessed by holding up a special black card included with the game. This will summon to the screen a menu which can be manipulated by the player's hands. The card has many other uses in the game depending on the context and gestures the player makes with it. These alternate uses for the card are selected from the menu summoned by the card. In the Move enabled versions of the game, the Move controller replaces the black card for accessing menus and interacting with the pet.<br/> <br/>In addition to the obvious sandbox style virtual-pet gameplay, the game also include minigames each with a leaderboard to foster competition. The player may also draw objects onto a piece of paper and "scan" them into the game by holding the paper in front of the camera, and the pet will try to recreate the drawing himself. Then, the drawn object will come to life as a 3D object that the Pet will interact with. The player may also customize their pet by choosing fur patterns, hats, and clothing.  <br/> <br/> <h2>Playstation Move ™: </h2>    <br/>In Addition, there is the New Version of Eyepet that is compatible with the <a data-ref-id="3015-4669" href="/playstation-move-support/3015-4669/" slug="playstation-move-support">Playstation Move</a> <a data-ref-id="3015-4669" href="/playstation-move-support/3015-4669/" slug="playstation-move-support">™</a>  Controller that enhances the gameplay by adding New experiences apart from the Magic Card.

Death Orb could be described as Pong 2.0.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><h3><br/></h3>Death Orb has appeared in episode one, episode two, and episode three of Qore, each time with new upgrades and revisions. The game is accessed by pressing L2 on the main menu of any episode. The premise is simple. Each player has seven lives. The first person to lose all of their lives is the loser. It's played like pong. One player serves the ball and the other must hit it back. Two players hit a ball back and forth on a playing field. However, instead of paddles, the player must use their reflexes and timing. As the ball is passing through their "goal", the user taps the "X" button to zap it with an electric force that reverses the balls path back to the other side. Each time the ball is hit, its speed increases. The user loses a life when the ball passes through their goal without being hit. If the ball passes through your goal, you get to serve the next ball.<br/><h3><br/></h3><h3>Death Orb</h3><br/>This was released in the first episode of Sony's interactive magazine, Qore. The game is nothing more than what is listed in the overview. However, instead of lives, there is just score. If you get the ball into the other player's goal, you get a point. The winner is whoever gets seven points first. <br/> <br/>The Qore team shot a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAxMByRpQwA" rel="nofollow">commercial for the first Death Orb</a>.<br/><br/><h3>Death Orb: Resurrection<figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3725/618513-death_orb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-618513" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0" data-width="0"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3725/618513-death_orb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-618513"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3725/618513-death_orb.jpg"></a><figcaption>Death Orb: Resurrection was made available in episode two of Qore and built on the original Death Orb.</figcaption></figure></h3><br/>Appearing in episode two of Qore, Resurrection builds on the game seen in the first episode. The game is now counted in lives and a new play mechanic is added. Players can now charge their serve. It's a simple meter, much like the kicking meters in Madden, where the player wants to hit it at its peak to achieve the most powerful shot. If the player does one of these more powerful shots and their opponent returns it and scores with that shot, they get a "Resurrection". If a player achieves a Resurrection, they gain a life. This requires the player to judge their opponent's skill and their own skill before serving a "power shot".<br/><br/><h3>Death Orb 3000: The Final Encounter<br/></h3><br/>This is the episode three edition of Death Orb. A new "Superweapons" ability was added. These superweapons are charged over the course of the game every time the player hits the ball. When the meter is filled, the player can use his superweapon to shoot a much faster shot to their opponent. Also, the ball doesn't need to be within the player's goal to be use the superweapon. A common tactic is to wait until the ball has just been hit by the opponent so it's still near their goal. This way, the other player can be caught by surprise. When the superweapon is used, time slows down until the ball is hit. If the opponent has their superweapon charged as well, they can activate it and a button mashing battle begins. Whoever can hit X faster will push the ball in the way of their opponent. A large circle is drawn around the ball. Depending on which way the ball exits, the ball will fly at full speed in that direction.]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>23651</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/0/3725/618513-death_orb.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3725/618513-death_orb.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/0/3725/618513-death_orb.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3725/618513-death_orb.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/3725/618513-death_orb.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3725/618513-death_orb.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/0/3725/618513-death_orb.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Death Orb]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating/><original_release_date>2008-06-05 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-88/]]></api_detail_url><id>88</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation Network (PS3)]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-network-ps3/3045-88/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3N]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/death-orb/3030-23651/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[Xedge

one based on fantasy and magic, another where technology thrives, and the demon world. <br/> <br/>In order for all of the souls to return to their own worlds, York and Miko must work together with May and other trapped souls like themselves in order to locate as many souls as they can and set them free.  But there's an opposing force at work attempting to collect the souls for themselves; the Twelve Knights, who follow the orders of the young girls <a data-ref-id="3005-10898" href="/cece/3005-10898/" slug="cece">   Cece</a> and <a data-ref-id="3005-10900" href="/mimi/3005-10900/" slug="mimi">  Mimi</a> and their timid brother <a data-ref-id="3005-10899" href="/vivi/3005-10899/" slug="vivi"> Vivi</a>, who is able to hear the voice of the Empyreal One.<br/> <br/><h2>Gameplay </h2>Cross Edge is an RPG in which the player controls a party of characters as they explore the world and fight enemies.  While exploring the world map, the player (represented by York) can scan the nearby area surrounding their character in order to search for souls, uncover locations, or discover events.  At special locations referred to as save points, the player can also ask May to perform a wide-area scan. <br/> <br/>When the player enters a dungeon, the game adopts a side-scrolling platformer perspective.  To explore, the player can run left and right, and perform a double-jump.  Treasure chests are also scattered about and can be opened to collect their contents. <br/> <br/>Combat in the game is <a data-ref-id="3015-192" href="/turn-based/3015-192/" slug="turn-based">                 turn-based</a>.  The player's active battle party can contain up to four characters, but individual characters can be swapped out during the player's turn.  The battle screen is comprised of two 3x4 grids, with the player's party being arranged on one and the enemies on the other.  Depending on a character's position on the grid in relation to an enemy, he or she may not be able to attack, but can be moved to another spot on the grid. <br/> <br/>Individual attacks are performed by selecting a character to attack with and an enemy to attack, and then pressing the face button that corresponds to the desired attack.  Attacks can be chained together, and special attack combos can be linked together.  For instance, if Morrigan uses her attack "Libido Touch" twice in a row, the player can quickly switch to MIko and perform her "Sweep" attack on the same enemy to deal heavy to both the target enemy.  Each attack consumes AP, and a character can continue to attack for as long as they have enough AP to perform at least one.  Each character can also learn special attacks accessed by holding down R2 and pressing a corresponding face button; these strikes consume far greater amounts of AP but the damage done is considerably higher. <br/> <br/>When combat ends, the party's hit points are restored if they are on the world map.  In dungeons, hit points are not restore and must be recovered using healing items. <br/> <br/><h3>Soul Scanning </h3>In scanning for souls, three types will appear on the world map, based on their shape: <br/><ul class="plain-list"><li>Cubes:  Similar to treasure chests.  Upon collecting this soul, treasures are given to the player.</li><li>Diamonds:  Triggers a story event.  Rewards may also be given or new paths may be unlocked.</li></ul><ul class="plain-list"><li>Spheres:  Major story events with combat.  As with the other types, rewards may be given out.</li><li>Save Points:  Not souls per se, but some save points are hidden and require the player to scan in order to find them.<br/></li></ul> <br/>It is not possible to scan for all souls in a zone the first time through.  As souls are collected, the player's scan level will increase.  When this occurs, souls that couldn't be found previously may now be located.  The game encourages the player to backtrack to previous areas using a fast travel system to scan them and find more souls. <br/> <br/>When on foot, the player can only scan the area immediately surrounding York on the world map.  At save points, May can scan a much larger radius.  However, this wide-area scan costs TP.<br/> <br/><h3>Costumes </h3>The female characters can collect costumes as the game progresses.  New costumes are unlocked over time as the player accumulates souls found on the world map.  When changing costumes, the character's portrait shifts to display the new outfit.  Costumes alter character stats, and depending on the costume, stats may be adjusted positively or negatively.<br/><br/><h2>Characters</h2>Cross Edge features characters from <a data-ref-id="3025-131" href="/darkstalkers/3025-131/" slug="darkstalkers">                         Darkstalkers</a>, <a data-ref-id="3025-152" href="/disgaea/3025-152/" slug="disgaea">                        Disgaea</a>, <a data-ref-id="3025-1107" href="/ar-tonelico/3025-1107/" slug="ar-tonelico">                       Ar Tonelico</a>, <a data-ref-id="3030-5580" href="/shinki-gensou-spectral-souls-ii/3030-5580/" slug="shinki-gensou-spectral-souls-ii">                      Spectral Souls</a>, <a data-ref-id="3030-273" href="/alchemist-marie-elie-futari-no-atelier/3030-273/" slug="alchemist-marie-elie-futari-no-atelier">                     Atelier Marie</a> and <a data-ref-id="3030-25683" href="/mana-khemia-2-fall-of-alchemy/3030-25683/" slug="mana-khemia-2-fall-of-alchemy">                    Mana Khemia 2</a>. <br/><br/><h3>Atelier Marie</h3><b><a data-ref-id="3005-10505" href="/marie/3005-10505/" slug="marie">                                       Marie</a> - </b>She has the lowest GPA in history at her magic academy because she is extremely absentminded.<br/><br/><h3>Mana Khemia 2</h3><b><a data-ref-id="3005-10062" href="/lily/3005-10062/" slug="lily">                   Liliane</a> - </b>Nicknamed Lily, she is known to narrate her daydreams loudly<b>.<br/></b><b><a data-ref-id="3005-10059" href="/rozeluxe-meitzen/3005-10059/" slug="rozeluxe-meitzen">                   Raze</a> -  </b>Lost his parents and was forced to work for Lily's family where they became friends and she developed a crush on him.<b><br/><a data-ref-id="3005-10063" href="/whim/3005-10063/" slug="whim">                   Whim</a> - </b>Lily's handmaiden.

Set during the <a href="/armageddon/3015-1435/" data-ref-id="3015-1435">end of days</a>, where the earth is threatened by the malevolent Lords of Shadow; the presence of the Lords of Shadow corrupted the balance between Earth and Heaven, which caused the souls of the dead to remain on earth instead of moving onward into the afterlife. Moreover, monsters have appeared on Earth and attack its inhabitants. Gabriel Belmont, a member of the "Brotherhood of Light", sets out to defeat the Lords and resurrect his fallen love, <a href="/marie-belmont/3005-13751/" data-ref-id="3005-13751">Marie</a>. Lords of Shadow takes Gabriel to the same familiar Castlevania haunts in search of the God Mask.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Combat</h3><p style="">Lords of Shadow features the same free form 3D action combat as made popular by games such as <a href="/devil-may-cry/3025-147/" data-ref-id="3025-147">Devil May Cry</a> and <a href="/god-of-war/3025-244/" data-ref-id="3025-244">God of War</a>. Gabriel uses his "Combat Cross", a cross that has a chain whip inside of it of and was quenched in Holy water during the forging process, letting it slay all manner of demons, werewolves, giant golems, and other monsters and undead featured in the <a href="/castlevania/3025-86/" data-ref-id="3025-86">Castlevania series</a>.</p><p style="">The combat cross comes with two types of attacks: a heavy attack that deals a lot of damage onto one specific enemy and an area attack that's not as powerful but that sweeps around Gabriel keeping the monsters at bay. Players can combine these attacks to form combos that they can purchase. These attacks can be executed in the air on both airborn and ground enemies with certain attacks such as the ground pound helpful in eliminating both enemies in the air and on the ground in one fluent combo. The cross can be upgraded in different ways. Killing opponents will award players with combo points, to which can then be spent on new combos for the Cross.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1523435-952494_20100916_790screen001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1523435" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5620253164557" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1523435-952494_20100916_790screen001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1523435"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33529/1523435-952494_20100916_790screen001.jpg"></a><figcaption>The Cross in Action</figcaption></figure><p style="">All the main upgrades for the cross are usually story focused and happen when players enter a church with a tomb in which they can put the cross. These upgrades can range from a grappling hook to the ability to tear down walls. These upgrades allow players to access previously inaccessible places, like in Metroid.</p><p style="">Gabriel can carry multiple secondary weapons. He first start offs with daggers that he can pick up after defeating enemies or by smashing vases. Players can upgrade these secondary weapons. For example, by upgrading their daggers, they can fire five daggers in a wave. Other secondary weapons include the Dark Crystal. This crystal is ultra powerful, killing all enemies on screen. To use the crystal, players must find three shards hidden around the environment. Other secondary weapons include Fairies that blow up upon contact with an enemy, Holy Water and a Shield.</p><p style="">Gabriel can grab his enemies by hitting the right shoulder button. These grabs can be done from afar thanks to the cross's chain. Once a player has grabbed an enemy, two circles will appear on the screen, one large circle that closes in on an inner circle. Once the outer circle becomes the inner one, the player must hit any button to complete the mini game. This will usually result in the execution of the enemy. This mini game is also used during certain sequences such as when the player is falling off a mount or to finish off an enemy.</p><p style="">Gabriel also possesses defensive moves and can block certain attacks. When an attack is unblockable, the game will usually tell the player this by making a part of the enemy glow. If players block an attack right before it hits, they can stun the enemy and execute a devastating counter attack. When the attack is too powerful to block, players can instead choose to dodge roll in any direction.</p><h3>Platforming</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11660/1523186-clos_tgs003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1523186" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11660/1523186-clos_tgs003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1523186"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11660/1523186-clos_tgs003.jpg"></a><figcaption>Epic Platforming</figcaption></figure><p style="">Gabriel can jump, swing and shimmy his way to safety. Most of the time, players jump from ledge to ledge. To climb up a ledge, players have to orient the stick up and Gabriel will go up. Like in Uncharted, when Gabriel can make the jump, he pulls out his arm in the direction he can jump to. Players can jump down from a ledge by just hitting down and the jump button.</p><p style="">The grappling hook comes into play during platforming sequences. You can hook onto things that are shiny and swing around. Players can also use it to climb up a wall. From there the player can jump and crash through windows or use the swing to jump farther. </p><h3>Magic</h3><p style="">The game offers shadow and light magic that Gabriel can use thanks to amulets that are given to him throughout the story. Both of these magics have their own bars and can be activated when these bars are full. By activating light magic, every hit the player lands on an enemy increases their health. With shadow magic on, you're attacks deal out more damage. By combining the two, players can perform deadly combos.</p><p style="">Players can replenish their magic thanks to neutral energy that they can pick up after defeating enemies. However, they must choose between replenishing their shadow or light magic. By fighting without getting hit, players fill up their focus meter. Once it is full, every hit they land automatically gives them neutral energy. Players can increase their magic as well as your health by finding Magic Gems on dead soldiers. Players can combine the magic with side weapons - for example, combining dark magic with the daggers makes for a dagger blast.</p><h3>Mounts</h3><p style="">Lords of Shadow lets players ride mounts. Some of these mounts are given to the player while others are enemies that must first be defeated. These mounts each have their own moves and can be used to solve puzzles. Most mounts can be easily killed once the player is done with them.</p><h4>Horse</h4><p style="">Players start the game on a horse and ride it at high speeds during different parts of the game. They can perform localised attacks on enemies that are following the player, and can hit the person riding a beast or hit the beast. Players can also dodge attacks and will sometimes start slipping off the horse at which point they must do a quick time event.</p><h4>Spider</h4><p style="">Players can mount giant spiders. While riding one players have both a heavy and light attack which usually involves slashing at the enemies. The spider can solve many puzzles in the environment, such as bringing down a wall or a tree to make a bridge. It can also create a bridge from web which the player can use to cross large gaps.</p><h4>Troll</h4><p style="">The troll is one of the most powerful creatures in Lords of Shadow. It has a basic, strong attack where the beast flails its arms before smashing them on the ground for a powerful area attack. It can also destroy big walls to clear a path for Belmont.</p><h4>Warg</h4><p style="">The warg has two different types of attacks. The first one is a claw attack and the other is a charge attack that can instantly kill an enemy. Wargs can jump really far by making the Warg sprint and then jumping. Wargs can also climb vines, which Belmont can't do on his own.</p><h4>Warthog</h4><p style="">The warthog is similar to the warthogs found in the Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess in their design. The warthog can use its horn to ram the enemies and can ram through doors.</p><h3>Enemies</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1409537-10_castlevania_e3final_konami_compressed_131.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1409537" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1409537-10_castlevania_e3final_konami_compressed_131.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1409537"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/669/1409537-10_castlevania_e3final_konami_compressed_131.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/669/1409537-10_castlevania_e3final_konami_compressed_131.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>A Giant Golem</figcaption></figure><p style="">Players must fight many different creatures in Lords of Shadow from trolls to golems. Boss battles must be handled in specific ways and some enemies that were bosses in previous stages of the game can become regular enemies in later stages. Some enemies such as trolls, boars or spiders can be mounted and used to wreak havoc or solve puzzles in the environment. For example, the spider can create a bridge that players can walk on and boars can break down doors. Players also end up fighting giant golems. These golems can only be destroyed by being climbed on and destroying certain parts of their body. Such fights are particularly reminiscent of <a href="/shadow-of-the-colossus/3030-6522/" data-ref-id="3030-6522">Shadow of the Colossus</a>.</p><h4>Journal</h4><p style="">All players need to know is stored in Gabriel's journal. The opening page of the journal gives the player information about how many Magic Gems they've collected and the state of their cross. Players can also view scrolls that they've picked up. One of the most important things of the journal is the combo store, where players can buy new combos directly from the journal with experience points that they've earned during the game.</p><p style="">The journal gives players important information about each creature they encounter, telling them what they're weaknesses are and their story, as well as provides in depth details about some of the story's main characters.</p><h2>Story</h2><h3>Main Characters</h3><h4><a href="/gabriel-belmont/3005-12350/" data-ref-id="3005-12350">Gabriel Belmont</a></h4><p style="">The game's main character, he's extremely tormented by the death of his beloved wife, Marie. He can't sleep since the death of his wife, as he's haunted by visions and nightmares. He's eaten up by vengeance and loses all humanity and compassion during the events of the game. All he wants to do is murder the creatures that are responsible for the death of his wife. He narrates the loading screens in the DLC chapters.</p><h4><a href="/marie-belmont/3005-13751/" data-ref-id="3005-13751">Marie Belmont</a></h4><p style="">Gabriel's wife, she was murdered by axe, by Gabriel under the spell of Zobek and is the reason for why Belmont wants to kill every undead being on the planet. She communicates with Gabriel through visions and is being used by God as a vessel of hope.</p><h4><a href="/zobek/3005-14647/" data-ref-id="3005-14647">Zobek</a></h4><p style="">This veteran is of the same Order as Gabriel. He's an experienced warrior and helps Belmont any way he can. However, he seems to have a secret agenda and something sinister to hide. He narrates the loading screens in the main game.</p><h4><a href="/pan/3005-16294/" data-ref-id="3005-16294">Pan</a></h4><p style="">Pan is a mystical spirit of the forest. He takes many forms including a horse and an eagle. He speaks in riddles and sometimes helps Gabriel in his quest. He's very wise and seems to be pulling the strings from the background and he too seems to have a secret agenda.</p><h3>Plot</h3><p style="">The game is set in the 11th century in a country that is never specified. The story takes place in a world where all hope is gone. Many demonic creatures have began appearing, killing off human kind. The game's main character is Gabriel Belmont and the story is narrated by <a href="/zobek/3005-14647/" data-ref-id="3005-14647">Zobek</a>. While Lords of Shadow is a new entry into the <a href="/castlevania/3025-86/" data-ref-id="3025-86">Castlevania franchise</a>, it is not a continuation of past events from the series. Lords of Shadow is considered by its developers to be a <a href="/franchise-reboot/3015-4151/" data-ref-id="3015-4151">reboot</a> of the franchise. The Belmont history is no more, and new secrets and revelations are made throughout the game that rewrites the mythology of the franchise.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1409518-5_castlevania_e3final_konami_compressed_019.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1409518" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1409518-5_castlevania_e3final_konami_compressed_019.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1409518"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/669/1409518-5_castlevania_e3final_konami_compressed_019.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/669/1409518-5_castlevania_e3final_konami_compressed_019.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Tormented</figcaption></figure><p style="">The game starts off with Gabriel arriving in a small village. He helps the villagers fend off an attack from <a href="/werewolves/3015-543/" data-ref-id="3015-543">werewolves</a>. He then enters a forbidden forest. He seeks <a href="/pan/3005-16294/" data-ref-id="3005-16294">Pan</a>, a spirit of the forest. As Gabriel's amulet leads the way, he's tormented by dreams of his deceased wife, killed by the evil creatures that are invading the world. On his way to finding Pan, to access the Lake of Oblivion, he runs into trouble with some goblins. Pan appears as a horse and helps Gabriel before disappearing.</p><p style="">After going through the rest of the forest, shifting through a deadly bog and solving a door puzzle, Belmont finally meets Pan in guardian form. Belmont tells the spirit that he's been sent by The Order of Light regarding the whole demon problem. The player discovers that the world has been cut off from the heavens. Basically, God can't communicate and enact his will on Earth anymore. Gabriel asks Pan if all hope is lost and of course Pan answers in riddles. Because the connection to God doesn't exist anymore, all the dead are trapped. The only way to communicate with them is at the Lake of Oblivion and Pan holds the key. The only way Pan will let our hero pass is if he solves a puzzle. The player must move circular platforms to make a bridge so he can walk up to his wife. Every time a platform is moved, a giant pendulum blade that swings over Marie gets lower. Gabriel succeeds but wakes up from the hallucination and walks through the gates to the lake.</p><p style="">Arriving on the frozen lake, Gabriel fights a giant ice golem. Just when the golem is about to get the upper hand <a href="/zobek/3005-14647/" data-ref-id="3005-14647">Zobek</a> arrives and saves Belmont, much to his chagrin as his kill is stolen at the last moment. Zobek too is with the Order and is friends with Pan, which is why he is here. Hundreds of lost souls wander around the lake and Gabriel manages to talk to Marie. She is being used by the Elders of the Order to communicate a prophecy to Belmont. This means that God is speaking through Marie and that there is still hope. What Belmont and Zobek must do is defeat all the Lords of Shadow to assemble the God Mask so Belmont can become the most powerful warrior on earth, the incarnation of God, and rid the world of evil.</p><p style="">Belmont and Zobek part ways and Belmont heads towards the lost city of Agaratha where the first Lord is said to be found. After traveling through a maze, Belmont makes it to the ruins only to have a near death experience with a golem. Suddenly, a young girl appears and breaks a crystal. Out of the crystal comes a giant, naked, half-woman half-demon monster that obliterates the golem. Before Gabriel can ask who she is, she escapes and he gives chase. He ends up following her into underground caves. After exploring the caves, Gabriel is almost killed by a giant black knight, before the young girl once again shows up and stops the knight from doing anything. It's revealed that the young girl's name is Claudia. She is mute but can speak into people's thoughts and read them, communicating with Belmont.</p><p style="">Claudia is actually the last surviving Aghartian. She used to live a peaceful life many years ago in Aghartha until the Lycans attacked the city. The Aghartians were peaceful beings who had created crystals that were so powerful that nobody ever risked attacking them. They used these crystals to build giant titans that protected them. The war against the Lycans lasted centuries until there were no more crystals. All the Aghartians were killed and those captured were turned into monsters. The <a href="/titan/3015-2302/" data-ref-id="3015-2302">titans</a> kept fighting but were eventually destroyed too, leaving the city in ruin. Among the people murdered were Claudia's father. Before he died he created the Black Knight, the girl's guardian who feeds on darkness and possesses her father's personality. The crystals have now become known as dark crystals and can be used to deliver considerable damage onto the enemy.</p><p style="">After reading Belmont's thoughts, Claudia decides that she and the Black Knight will help him in his struggle to defeat the Lords of Shadow.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/976/1471654-952493_20100819_screen008.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1471654" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/976/1471654-952493_20100819_screen008.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1471654"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/976/1471654-952493_20100819_screen008.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/976/1471654-952493_20100819_screen008.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Last Titan</figcaption></figure><p style="">However, before fighting the evil lord, Gabriel will first have to kill the last surviving Titan(but the skeleton dragon is referred to as a titan and is re-animated near to the end). The Last Titan is huge, much bigger than the ice golem. Thanks to the help of the Black Knight, who cuts part of the Titan's leg off, and Claudia who gives a crystal to Gabriel, our hero kills the final Titan by stabbing it in the face with the crystal. After this long and epic fight, the three decide to go and rest.</p><p style="">While resting, Gabriel has a weird dream where he wakes up Claudia, who tells him that she's seen her fate, just before Gabriel stabs her to death. When we see Gabriel's face, weird silver marks are spread across it. Note that this also happened during his vision of Marie at the Lake of Oblivion. Gabriel wakes up to find Pan standing in front of him, telling him that he must do what he must do and to take the Black Knight's gauntlet. Said gauntlet is extremely powerful and would help Gabriel in his quest. Belmont refuses, telling the spirit that he doesn't wish to betray Claudia. Pan replies that he already has. In horror, Gabriel discovers a dead Claudia, with a dagger, Gabriel's dagger, sticking out of her chest. The Knight appears and Belmont is forced to fight and defeat him. He takes the Gauntlet, buries Claudia and soldiers on.</p><p style="">Gabriel arrives at the entrance of the first Lord's hiding place. The door is unlocked by fairies and he's able to reach the first Lord, <a href="/cornell/3005-8531/" data-ref-id="3005-8531">Cornell</a>, ruler of the Lycans. Gabriel claims that he must kill Cornell to fulfill the prophecy. The Lord tells Belmont that he is being deceived. He goes on to explain how the Brotherhood of Light came to be (the order Gabriel belongs to). Three founders helped God's fight against the devil and won. They were then lead to three spots where God's influence was extremely powerful. There they sacrificed themselves, turning into powerful spirits, their power only second to God's. However, they left their dark side on earth, these dark sides that were reincarnated into the Lords of Shadow. This means that if Gabriel were to kill a Lord, then the good spirit would die too. Gabriel refuses to believe this and begins to fight Cornell.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/976/1404701-952493_20100615_screen011.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1404701" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.4150943396226" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:141.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/976/1404701-952493_20100615_screen011.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1404701"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/976/1404701-952493_20100615_screen011.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/976/1404701-952493_20100615_screen011.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Cornell</figcaption></figure><p style="">Despite Cornell's giant war hammer and the fact that he turns into a very big werewolf, Belmont comes out on top. Gabriel takes his hammer from him, bashes him over the head a couple times, then when the hammer breaks, he takes its handle puts it through Cornell's face. Right after defeating the Lord, Cornell's cyclone boots attach to Gabriel's feet, letting him run faster. A piece of the God Mask falls from the sky and Gabriel takes it. He also witnesses a brief vision of Marie who caresses his cheek and tells him that he's doing good.</p><p style="">Gabriel encounters Pan in eagle form who offers to bring him to his next destination. So starts an epic montage of Gabriel flying an eagle across many lands. They land at the entrance of Crows' Pass. Pan once again can go no farther and when Belmont asks the spirit why he's helping him, Pan simply responds that he is not, and that not everything is what it seems. Crows' Pass is the entrance to vampire territory where the next piece of the God Mask can be found. The Pass is guarded by a once sexy witch who goes by the name of <a href="/malphas/3005-17651/" data-ref-id="3005-17651">Malphas</a>. The witch must be defeated in order for Gabriel to continue on his quest.</p><p style="">After fighting a giant ogre (Belmont blinds the beast before slitting its throat with a piece of the environment) and playing hide and seek with a <a href="/chupacabra/3015-6263/" data-ref-id="3015-6263">chupacabra</a> (a mystical midget that steals all of Gabriel's powers and taunts Gabriel while he searches for the midget), Belmont climbs to the tallest tower and confronts the witch. The witch is actually a giant crow with a skull for a head (the Crow Witch). She controls the local crows and lays eggs. Belmont defeats her by throwing an egg back to her face, grabbing onto her and slamming her face first into the tower before decapitating her.</p><p style="">After her death, the tower begins to collapse and once again Pan appears, this time as a horse, and saves the day. Belmont is dropped off into the Berros Woods and after fighting his way through the woods, comes to a clearing where he can see from afar the massive castle of the vampires. He enters the small village near the castle and discovers Zobek praying near a pile of dead soldiers. It's revealed that Zobek has been following Gabriel since the beginning of the game but Belmont does not know this. Zobek explains that the vampires know they're coming and are getting ready for a fight. He explains that the small village has been safe from any vampire attacks thanks to an abbot who wields a weapon that reproduces the light of the sun. However, the abbot has gone slightly mad, locking himself in his abbey and booby-trapping the whole place. Zobek recommends getting this weapon as it will aid in the fight against the vampires.</p><p style="">Zobek and Gabriel make their way into the abbey and must solve a variety of puzzles and traps, including the classic ceiling trap where</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/976/1471663-952493_20100819_screen017.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1471663" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.415" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:141.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/976/1471663-952493_20100819_screen017.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1471663"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/976/1471663-952493_20100819_screen017.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/976/1471663-952493_20100819_screen017.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Zobek</figcaption></figure><p style="">different slabs of rock descend from the ceiling and our two heroes are forced to make haste. Gabriel finds a stake that he attaches to the bottom of his cross. The abbey's underground is also where your first encounter with vampires occurs. Gabriel and Zobek eventually end up getting separated (Zobek falls into a trap) and Gabriel is forced to climb alone to the tallest tower of the abbey where the abbot is hidden.</p><p style="">Gabriel meets up with Zobek and both go to confront the abbot, gone mad and muttering weird prayers. Belmont tells him that he's not worthy of being a man of God since he let most of the people in the village die because of the vampires. Despite the mad man's pleas, Belmont takes the relic and leaves with Zobek. The abbot starts cursing them, telling them that they were sent by Satan and that they must die. Suddenly vampires appear in the tower and make a feast out of the abbot.</p><p style="">As our two heroes are about to leave, a wounded young boy from the village arrives. He says that the vampires have come for Belmont and want him to come to the village. Despite Gabriel clearly knowing that it's a trap, he agrees while Zobek stays to take care of the young lad. After fighting many <a href="/vampire/3015-117/" data-ref-id="3015-117">vampires</a>, a vampire general who goes by the name of <a href="/brauner/3005-4244/" data-ref-id="3005-4244">Brauner</a> arrives. He wields a giant sword that he throws at Gabriel. Belmont catches the sword mid-flight and throws it back at him. After several throws, Gabriel gets a hold of the general, cuts the hand that was holding the sword off, catches the sword, plants the sword half way through the vampires face and starts stabbing it with his stake in the back. Once Brauner is dead, Gabriel prepares to leave. He's worshiped by the villagers and one of them shows him a secret passage into the vampire castle. Zobek stays behind as he has some unfinished business to attend to.</p><p style="">The secret passage leads Belmont through the sewers. The vampire's defenses are strong but our hero is stronger. He eventually finds the key to the castle and enters the vampire's lair. He solves a variety of puzzles and the sun sets, meaning what used to be three or four</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/976/1404736-952493_20100615_screen028.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1404736" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.4150943396226" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:141.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/976/1404736-952493_20100615_screen028.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1404736"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/976/1404736-952493_20100615_screen028.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/976/1404736-952493_20100615_screen028.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Creepy Laura</figcaption></figure><p style="">attacking vampires turns into endless waves. Gabriel encounters Laura, a vampire who takes the form of a human. This Lord of Shadow is a female which surprises Gabriel, she's maintained her young girl looks despite being hundred of years old. She will tell Belmont where the queen is, if he plays her favorite board game, Vampire Wargame. After beating the vampire she disappears and Gabriel continues his quest through the castle.</p><p style="">He arrives in the refectory where he witnesses a peculiar sight: a giant evil Butcher brings human limbs out to feed the ghouls. It's revealed that once the vampires are finished sucking all the blood out of the humans, they send it down to the kitchen where the butcher serves it to the ghouls. The problem is that the butcher has a key that Gabriel needs to progress. He faces off with the Evil Butcher who fights with a giant butcher knife. After an epic battle, Gabriel tries to take the giant knife away from the butcher with his cross, but the butcher's force makes it impossible. So Gabriel just lets the cross go, flinging the Butcher's knife into his skull. Gabriel then takes the knife and savagely finishes him off.</p><p style="">Thanks to the Butcher's key, Gabriel makes his way to Dr. <a href="/frankenstein/3005-4977/" data-ref-id="3005-4977">Frankenstein</a>'s lab. The doctor has since then passed, eaten by the queen for having created ungodly creations. After solving many complicated electrical puzzles, Belmont faces off with one of Frankenstein's creatures: a giant mechanical <a href="/spider/3015-1873/" data-ref-id="3015-1873">spider</a> that Belmont defeats by simply making it run out of batteries. After the fight, he finds a red lens that will help him solve one of the many puzzles in the castle.</p><p style="">After solving more complicated puzzles, Gabriel once again runs into <a href="/laura/3005-15732/" data-ref-id="3005-15732">Laura</a>. Laura is annoyed for having lost against Gabriel in her game and sends her "toys" after him, giant dolls. After he destroys the dolls, Laura becomes violent and electrocutes him until he's near death. As Gabriel kneels down to accept defeat, Marie appears to him again. She tells him that it is not his time, that he must still go on. Gabriel refuses, saying that he's done "questionable" things and that he wants to join her in the afterlife. Laura, standing to the side, listens to the entire conversation. She's touched by the love between the two, an emotion she is no longer capable of, and spares Gabriel's life, since she "doesn't feel like playing anymore". This leaves Belmont to soldier on and face the next Lord of Shadow.</p><p style="">After fighting his way through more of the castle and a clocktower, Gabriel must face one last enemy before the vampire queen: <a href="/olrox/3005-16064/" data-ref-id="3005-16064">Olrox</a>, Brauner's brother and the vampire queen's right hand man. He wields two giant swords and vows to bring Gabriel's head to his superior. Gabriel ends up beating him by taking his sword and sticking it through his neck. He drains him of all his blood and uses the blood to solve a maze puzzle to open the door that leads him to the queen.</p><p style="">The queen goes by the name of <a href="/camilla/3005-8461/" data-ref-id="3005-8461">C</a>armilla. She reveals to Gabriel that what Cornell said was true: the Lords of Shadow were created by the founder of Gabriel's order. Carmilla used to be an excellent healer and pure of heart. When she transformed into a powerful spirit, what was left on earth became corrupt and turned into the vampire queen. Carmilla is seductive towards Gabriel, promising him eternal life and pleasure by her side. Gabriel refuses, to which the queen tells him that there is no such thing as bringing the dead back to life and that Marie is dead.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/976/1404690-952493_20100615_screen005.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1404690" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.4150943396226" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:141.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/976/1404690-952493_20100615_screen005.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1404690"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/976/1404690-952493_20100615_screen005.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/976/1404690-952493_20100615_screen005.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Carmilla</figcaption></figure><p style="">The queen unleashes hordes of vampires onto Gabriel and then turns into her real form, a giant vampire, a Lord of Shadow.</p><p style="">After an epic fight, Carmilla decides that she has lost the fight and tries to flee. Gabriel catches on to her leg but is quickly kicked off. As he falls to his death, he throws his spiked whip that goes through Carmilla's chest. But that doesn't stop her, she starts flying next to one of the castle's many towers. Gabriel plants his feet onto the roof of the tower and pulls at his whip. His force is so strong that his pulling begins to make the tower collapse. He succeeds in pulling and impales Carmilla onto the tip of the tower that collapses... but it's still not over. Carmilla survives and Gabriel starts stabbing her with the tip of his combat cross, where the stake is built in. After enough quick stabbing, he plunges the cross into the Lord's chest and breaks the stake off, finally killing the vampire queen.</p><p style="">After the slaughter, Gabriel gets a new part of the God Mask. Pan appears through a portal telling Gabriel that he's doing well. Belmont doesn't care anymore. The order has betrayed him and all of mankind. He wants answers and of course Pan doesn't give them. He just asks our hero how far he's willing to go for the truth. The final Lord is Death himself, Gabriel steps through Pan's portal which takes him to the the abyss where he can find the last lord. He's not fighting for the order anymore but for his love, Marie.</p><p style="">He steps into Pan's portal and is teleported to a weird land near the abyss that will lead him to Death. He meets an old witch who goes by the name of <a href="/baba-yaga/3005-4384/" data-ref-id="3005-4384">Baba Yaga</a>. She's crazy and keeps mentioning that the "King of the Angels" had told her of Gabriel's arrival. She can help Gabriel but first he must do something for her: retrieve her blue rose that is locked in a magic box. Belmont retrieves the key of the magic box (that was being held by possessed scarecrows) and Baba shrinks our hero so he can go into the box and retrieve the rose. After dodging all of the music box's traps (the music box plays original <a href="/castlevania-ii-simons-quest/3030-11820/" data-ref-id="3030-11820">Castlevania 2</a> music), Gabriel is unshrunk and gives the rose to Baba. The witch respects their agreement and teleports Belmont to the Titan graveyard, just outside of Necromancer territory. It's explained that Baba Yaga is slaughtered by Zobek offscreen so she wouldn't "interfere" anymore.</p><p style="">Gabriel finds himself on the outskirts of the land of the dead. He makes his way through the graveyard and meets once again Pan. Gabriel is surprised to see the spirit here and Pan explains that only one of them can come out alive of this encounter. Gabriel is sick of all of Pan's riddles, that he wants the truth. Pan of course doesn't give it to him and turns into the Silver Warrior.

This is by far the least gruesome fight of the entire game. As Pan collapses, Gabriel asks him why he forced him to kill him. Pan answers that he was testing Gabriel and that he is ready. The only way to enter the Necromancer's territory is by spilling the blood of a God and that is what Gabriel has done. As Pan dies, Gabriel laments his fate, saying that he didn't deserve this. Yet, he decides to go on.</p><p style="">He makes his way to the center of the land, the Crematory Oven. After slaughtering thousands of zombies, he makes it to the Oven where he encounters the Grave Digger who fights with a giant, scorching hot shovel. After an epic fight, Gabriel manages to open the oven, take the gravedigger's shovel and whack the beast on the head with it before pushing the Gravedigger into his own oven. As the beast falls to his death, he slings his tongues out which catch Gabriel and start dragging him down into the oven. Despite Gabriel using the shovel to hold himself from falling it breaks and Gabriel falls into the pit. He manages to hang on to the ledge and get a hold of a sharp rusted piece of metal which he uses to cut the beasts tongue, freeing himself. He climbs out of the oven and continues his desperate quest.</p><p style="">He finally makes it into the Necromancer's Abyss. Gabriel's mental health is in shambles, he hasn't slept in days and has no pity for any of the enemies he crosses. He's called by Zobek the "Prince of Shadow". He soldiers on, killing necromancers and ends up climbing to the highest point of the abyss, where he meets Death. Death calls Gabriel a hypocrite, that Gabriel and he are one in the same. Death takes on the form of a giant skeleton dragon( the LAST titan) that flies around and spits acid at our hero. Gabriel climbs on to Death and crashes him into his own tower. He destroys him and the abyss begins to collapse. Gabriel manages to get to the platform where the final piece of the mask resides.</p><p style="">Gabriel puts the pieces together and assembles the God Mask. As he holds it in his hands, Zobek shows up. He congratulates Gabriel and his quest but says that it's time to end the charades and that the truth must be revealed. Zobek takes out the devil mask and puts it on his face, revealing that he's the final Lord of Shadow. As a Lord of Shadow, he was frustrated that the different Lords didn't unite to take on God and rule the world. By uniting their powers, they could easily trump God and make darkness invade the land. So Zobek decided to go to the deepest reaches of hell where he trained himself in the dark arts.

He tricked the order into sending a warrior (Gabriel) to solve the situation. Zobek knew that this warrior needed extreme motivation. So what he did was place the Devil Mask on Gabriel, making Gabriel kill his own wife. He also did the same thing for Claudia. To control Gabriel, he cast a spell on his gauntlet. The spell controlled Gabriel's magic powers and Zobek decides to once more use it on Gabriel, making him defenseless.</p><p style="">After this grand speech, Zobek tells Gabriel that he was but a puppet, and that he served his master well. Gabriel did many terrible, sinful things during his quest and because God can't forgive him, he'll be banished to hell for eternity. Zobek zaps Gabriel to death and stands laughing as the final Lord possesses the mask and ultimate power. Suddenly a voice booms from the sky telling Zobek that he's not respecting the agreement and that he's out of line. Zobek is lit on fire and burns to death. Through the ashes emerges Satan himself, who picks up the God Mask. Satan has been wanting to take revenge on God who banished him and he finally has that chance. He's the one who's behind the entire thing, Zobek was just a puppet.</p><p style="">Gabriel is in limbo where thousands of spirits fly around him, ready to take him to the afterlife. Marie's ghost appears, telling all the spirits to back off, that if Gabriel dies than all hope is lost. The spirits agree and decide to give life back to Gabriel. Gabriel rises and confronts Satan. Satan explains that there is no point on fighting since Gabriel is going to hell one way or another because of the evil deeds he has committed. Gabriel replies that God is great and that he only has to ask for forgiveness and God will welcome him with open arms. Satan denies this, telling him that God does not love him since he's abandoned him. Gabriel knows this is false as he now possesses powers given to him by God. Satan, now wearing the God Mask, and Gabriel clash in an epic battle.</p><p style="">As the battle rages on, Satan begins to realize that Belmont has the power of a God. Belmont uses all the powers he has and beats Satan with his own fists. However, Satan is able to stab Gabriel with his spear. This does nothing to Gabriel who simply takes it out. He then takes Satan in a choke hold. As Satan begins to realize that the battle is lost, he keeps on trying to convince Gabriel that God doesn't care about humankind anymore. Gabriel says that God's love is great and that He'd never abandon them. All of Belmont's godly powers unleash themselves and obliterate Satan. Exhausted, Gabriel falls to the ground as trapped spirits begin making their way towards the heavens.</p><p style="">Marie's ghost appears once again. Gabriel begs for forgiveness to which she tells him that he's done well. Unfortunately, she too had lied to him: she can not be brought back to life. All hope leaves Gabriel's body and he wishes to die so he can be with her. Marie requests that he stay alive, as he deserves to. Still believing that the God Mask can bring the dead back, Gabriel wears it and he does indeed see his Marie as though she is living. But when he takes it off, she's a spirit again. This reveals that the God Mask was merely a tool to see the dead, bringing them back in a visual form. However, what is dead is dead. Marie flies off, telling Gabriel she loves him. Claudia appears for a brief instance, showing Gabriel that she forgives him. Belmont is left standing there as the camera pans onto the devil mask.</p><p style="">The credits roll.</p><p style="">An epilogue is then shown. A hooded man enters a cathedral. After briefly staring at a statue of Christ crucified he makes his way to an abandoned part of the cathedral, where he breaks down a wall. He arrives in a large tall room full of gothic statues. At this point, the man's feet leave the ground as he levitates. He levitates to a ledge that enters a big room with a giant stained glass window at the front of the cathedral. The man takes off his hood and is revealed to be Zobek. He begins talking to a man who's sitting on a throne in the shadows, telling him that for a prince of shadow, his hiding spot is strange.

Satan is preparing to march on earth once again and Zobek needs this person's help. He calls this person by his real name: Gabriel. Suddenly the man in the shadows reveals himself. It is indeed Gabriel, or what's left of him. Gabriel now goes by the name of Dracula. It's unclear how he became the lord of the vampires but Zobek states that Dracula must not stay in this state of self pity. Dracula suddenly disappears and Zobek tells him that Satan will turn him into one of his pets and that he must come out of the shadows. Suddenly Dracula grabs Zobek who teleports out of his robe and is revealed to be wearing a modern business suit. He pushes Dracula through the stained glass window and Dracula lands on a busy contemporary street. It's revealed that hundreds of years have passed since Gabriel defeated Satan. In this shocking turn of events Zobek asks Dracula if he will help him defeat Satan. Dracula yells and disappears as Zobek simply walks away, leaving the game open for a sequel.</p><h2>DLC</h2><h3>Reverie</h3><p style="">The first DLC available for Lords of Shadow, it allowed players to play as both Gabriel and Laura.

By killing the three Lords of Shadow, Gabriel unleashed an even bigger evil: the Forgotten One, an incredibly powerful demon whom the Brotherhood imprisoned in the Shadow Plane, an alternate dimension, through a sealed portal deep in the center of the castle. The Forgotten One's seal was held in place by the life energies of the three Brotherhood founders; when they later became the Lords of Shadow, the seal was the silver lining in the cloud, as the seal would remain intact forever because of their immortality. With Cornell and Carmilla having been slain by Gabriel and Zobek having been killed (for now) by Satan, though, the seal is decaying, and soon the Forgotten One will be free.</p><p style="">After opening the gate to the fortress, Gabriel and Laura travel through the ancient castle. They gather the blood of the three founders in order to open the gate to the Forgotten One's chamber. However, only dark beings can enter into the dimension where the Forgotten One is kept. To bypass this, Laura asks Gabriel to drink all of her blood and become a vampire, knowing that her small body does not contain enough blood to allow Gabriel to drink enough to transform while still allowing her enough to survive. Without a choice, Gabriel agrees to help Laura commit suicide, and so Laura dies and is thus freed from her eternal torment, while Gabriel begins a slow transformation into a creature of the night, and steps through the gate to confront what awaits him.</p><h3>Resurrection</h3><p style="">The second and last piece of DLC, it takes place in the Dimensional Rift, the prison in the Shadow Plane where the Forgotten One was sealed.</p><p style="">Gabriel falls down to his knees, feeling pain caused by his slow transformation into a vampire.</p><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/90729/2483807-the-forgotten-one.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2483807" data-ratio="1.4147176269253" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:141.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/90729/2483807-the-forgotten-one.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2483807"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/9/90729/2483807-the-forgotten-one.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/9/90729/2483807-the-forgotten-one.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Gabriel faced the Forgotten One</figcaption></figure><p style="">Shortly after that, a giant white armored hand comes out of the Lava and Gabriel hides behind a rock, while the Forgotten One emerges and starts to climb up the tower-like cave.</p><p style="">Gabriel follows the Forgotten One while avoiding this gaze (which instantly kills him if detected).</p><p style="">At the top, the Forgotten One unleashes his essence upon the first Prison Seal, slowly destroying it. This weakens him greatly and he falls down to his knees. Gabriel charges towards the Forgotten One in an ingame-cutscene and successfully destroys the armor on the Forgotten One's right leg, exposing the black and green-glowing flesh beneath.</p><p style="">After a fierce battle, the first Seal is finally broken and the essence returns to the Forgotten One who continues onward his path to freedom. Another platforming lava sequence where Gabriel must hide unfolds and eventually the Forgotten One uses the same pillar Gabriel is holding onto to destroy a giant gate. When the gate is destroyed, the Forgotten One throws the pillar in the lava, not knowing that Gabriel was on it, and walks away.</p><p style="">On the middle on a platform, he finds the Forgotten One releasing his essence on the final Prison Seal. They fight again and Gabriel manages to break the face armor of the Forgotten One, exposing the right side of his face. Before he could finish it, the final PRison Seal breaks.</p><p style="">The Forgotten One taunts Gabriel, stating he will inflict ten times the pain the Brotherhood inflicted on him as payback. As he prepares to absorb back the dark essence floating to him from the portal, Gabriel jumps in the air and and absorbs it himself, turning his hair white. The Forgotten One yells in anger and tries to crush Gabriel, but he teleports to safety, floating in the air. The Forgotten One yields and begs for mercy, calling Gabriel his <i>liege.</i> Without an answer, Gabriel slices the demon in half.</p><p style="">In the final scene Gabriel looks at his Combat Cross and crushes it in his hand in disgust, before leaving the pieces of his signature weapon lying discarded on the ground in the Shadow Plane, and walking through the portal back to our world.</p><h2>Development History</h2><p style="">Originally unveiled at E3 2008 as 'Lords of Shadow' with a brief teaser, no other details were shown of the game for nearly a year. Lords of Shadow was then featured in <a href="/kojima-productions/3010-2057/" data-ref-id="3010-2057">Kojima Productions</a> web teaser for E3 2009 in way of the all-important mask though the viral marketing campaign. This led to much fervent discussion across message boards as the game was theorized to be a spin-off of <a href="/hideo-kojima/3040-63395/" data-ref-id="3040-63395">Hideo Kojima</a>'s <a href="/metal-gear/3025-5/" data-ref-id="3025-5">Metal Gear</a> franchise. At Konami's E3 press conference, it was revealed that the game was Lords of Shadow and was still being developed by MercurySteam. Kojima Productions, and in particular Hideo Kojima, would be overlooking the production, with <a href="/david-cox/3040-803/" data-ref-id="3040-803">David Cox</a> serving as the project producer and Enric Alvarez as director. A popular rumour about the game was that it started out development as a new IP and was later altered to be a new part of the popular Castlevania franchise, but this is not the case; in truth, it was <em>always </em>a Castlevania game, and the game's true title and franchise connections were not revealed at first so that the fighting game <a href="/castlevania-judgment/3030-20831/" data-ref-id="3030-20831">Castlevania: Judgement</a> would not suffer from the knowledge that a "real" Castlevania game was soon to arrive.</p><p style="">Kojima said that his involvement is limited to "[fixing] things on [his] creative viewpoint". Once penned onto the game, he asked for several redesigns to be carried out to the original project. The extent of these redesigns is not fully known. Kojima gives the example of asking MercurySteam to redesign Gabriel visually, and give him a more "heroic" face, which now resembles more that of Robert Carlyle, while at first was more barbaric.</p><p style="">Lords of Shadow uses a proprietary engine developed in house. Cox stated at E3 2009 that the game was approximately 50% complete, and that it was running at a smooth 30 frames per second. He said that forcing the game to run at 60 frames per second was not one of the team's main goals.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p style="">The music for Castlevania: Lords of Shadow was composed by Oscar Araujo and performed by the Bratislava Symphony Orchestra.

It provides an up close and personal look at a <a data-ref-id="3015-1254" href="/space-marine/3015-1254/">Space Marine</a> on duty and a gameplay experience with an equal mix of shooting and melee combat. Players take control of <a data-ref-id="3005-16233" href="/captain-titus/3005-16233/">Captain Titus</a> of the <a data-ref-id="3015-1314" href="/ultramarines/3015-1314/">Ultramarines</a> as he leads a small group of Imperial soldiers on a Forge World, trying to hold back an <a data-ref-id="3015-492" href="/orc/3015-492/">Ork</a> invasion. One of the game's innovative mechanics is how Titus's health is managed. He has a shield that regenerates but a health bar that doesn't. Furthermore the only way for him to regain health is by curb stomping enemies. Since many of these baddies travel in packs, players have to weigh the risk of being attacked with the reward of regaining health.The class-based multiplayer contains customizable Space Marines of the Imperium and the Chaos Space Marines. The two multiplayer modes available at launch were Annihilation (standard <a data-ref-id="3015-2463" href="/team-deathmatch/3015-2463/">team deathmatch</a>) and Seize Ground (similar to <a data-ref-id="3015-1292" href="/king-of-the-hill/3015-1292/">King of the Hill</a>). Relic also added a Horde-like 4 player co-op mode called 'Exterminatus' in October, 2011.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p style="">Forge Worlds are planets designated by the <a data-ref-id="3015-5861" href="/imperium-of-man/3015-5861/">Imperium</a> as worldwide factories. These worlds produce <i>everything</i> for the Imperium, from the smallest house hold device to Emperor-class Battle Titans. One such world is under siege by a force of <a data-ref-id="3015-492" href="/orc/3015-492/">Orks</a>, who are intent on its plunder to continue their slaughter of the galaxy. As Captain <a data-ref-id="3005-16233" href="/captain-titus/3005-16233/">Titus</a>, you lead your company of Ultramarines with assistance from the Imperial Guard in the defence of key locations across the planet. If the Battle Titan Factory and other Imperial weapons located on the planet were to fall into Ork hands, countless more worlds would be in danger of the Ork threat. Unbeknownst to the defenders, a sinister <a data-ref-id="3015-650" href="/chaos/3015-650/">Chaos</a> plot is <i>also</i> unfolding under the cover of this alien invasion, and you must discover it before it's too late.</p><h3>Character Bios</h3><p style=""><u><b>Captain Titus</b></u> (voiced by <a data-ref-id="3040-98504" href="/mark-strong/3040-98504/">Mark Strong</a>)</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13941/1797108-titus_0.png" data-ref-id="1300-1797108" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="1.1731448763251" data-width="283" style="width: 283px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:117.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13941/1797108-titus_0.png" data-ref-id="1300-1797108"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/13941/1797108-titus_0.png"></a><figcaption>Captain Titus</figcaption></figure><p style="">A company commander of a detachment of Ultramarines. A 150 year old veteran and still considered relatively young, he is a decorated veteran of major campaigns waged across the galaxy – his exploits have earned him a reputation as one of the mightiest Ultramarines.</p><p style="">Over his long service, Titus has overcome countless opponents and suffered many wounds, both physical and psychological. In his earliest days, he struggled to overcome his own temper. Later, he survived the death of his entire squad at the hands of a Chaos Sorcerer; Titus killed the fiend, but suffered terrible wounds -- and some questioned how he survived.</p><p style="">Titus became company commander when his predecessor died in battle. He was by his mentor's side when he fell, and still feels the weight of taking over his mantle.</p><p style=""><u><b>Sergeant Sidonus</b></u> (voiced by <a data-ref-id="3040-35253" href="/richard-hawley/3040-35253/">Richard Hawley</a>)</p><p style="">A veteran warrior with 225 years of experience defending the Imperium from the menaces of space. He lost his arm in a battle with the Tyranids and uses a bionic replacement. Also much of his face is scarred from the blast of an Eldar weapon that also took one of his eyes. So many years of fighting have left him with an attitude of 'been there, done that, no problem' and a dry sense of humor that reveals itself during moments of tense stress. Along with his experience comes a warrior of great efficiency that will not stop until every last enemy is dead.</p><p style=""><u><b>Leondros</b></u> (voiced by Noah Huntley)</p><p style="">The most recent member of Captain Titus command squad. He could be considered a typical Ultramarine with his formal speech and devotion to do things just right. Along with this he cannot understand why regular humans are unable give their all in the service for the Emperor. He patronizes the surviving <a data-ref-id="3015-1312" href="/imperial-guard/3015-1312/">Imperial Guard</a> for their short comings. As a younger recruit, he looks up the older veterans, especially Titus. He aspires to be like them and, at times, will go overboard with attempting to prove himself.</p><p style=""><u><b>Second Lieutenant Mira</b></u> (voiced by Christine Roberts)</p><p style="">Mira is the leader of the surviving Imperial Guard Forces on the Forge World, remnants of a much larger detachment that was decimated when the Orks invaded the planet. She was part of the 203rd Cadian Regiment that was en route to another warzone, but was diverted to the Forge World as the only Imperial Guard force nearby. Mira's men are firecely loyal to her, a loyalty that is inspired by her skill as a tactician and her deep humanity. Her primary goal is to ensure the survival of the men she leads.</p><p style=""><u><b>Inquisitor Drogan</b></u> (voiced by Danny Webb)</p><p style="">Drogan is a member of The Inquisition - a shadowy organization charged with eliminating the foes of humanity. He was once fell captured by alien foes, which led to years of torture. This has resulted in him having a deep hatred for aliens, and because of this he has spent his life creating new and more effective ways to eliminate them. This obsession has led him to seek technologies thought lost or impossible to the Imperium, and has resulted in the development of a power source that is capable of producing tremendous amounts of mysterious energy.</p><p style=""><u><b>Chaos Lord Nemeroth</b></u></p><p style="">Nemeroth once exemplified what a Space Marine should be. Over the centuries, however, he grew disillusioned with the traditions and rules Space Marines are required to live by. The Chaos Gods took this chance to seduce Nemeroth with promises of great power, both physical and psychic. Having tasted this power, he craves it even more. He has completely abandoned his humanity, and his ultimate goal is to transcend it completely.</p><p style=""><u><b>Warboss Grimskull</b></u></p><p style="">Orks are brutal by nature, and this brutality leads to them fighting each other more than their other enemies much of the time. It is only when a Warboss crushes his rivals and unites several tribes that a WAAAAGH! begins, which is a combination of migration and holy war. Warboss Grimskull is as mighty as any Warboss and more cunning than most. His strategy is simple but effective: identify the enemies weak spots and crush them. His goal is to obtain the great warmachines built on the Forge World to serve his WAAAGH!.</p><h3>Enemies</h3><p style=""><u><b>Orks</b></u></p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/72451/1843436-melee_boy_pro_1.png" data-ref-id="1300-1843436" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.9512893982808" data-width="349" style="width: 349px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:95.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/72451/1843436-melee_boy_pro_1.png" data-ref-id="1300-1843436"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/72451/1843436-melee_boy_pro_1.png"></a><figcaption>Ork Choppa Boy</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Gretchin: Due to their diminutive size, Gretchin pose little threat and are often relegated to menial tasks for their Ork masters. However, when they engage in combat they do so <i>en masse</i> serving as a good distraction for the larger Orks.</li><li>Bomb Squig: The simplest form of Orkoid life, Squigs are little more than fanged mouths on legs. To make these creatures even more lethal, however, Orks often strap crude explosive devices to their backs and send them on suicide charges into the enemy lines.</li><li>Shoota Boyz: A medium sized Ork, Shoota Boyz love guns and the fire power they produce. This fact, as well their great numbers, allows them to form the backbone of the Greenskin ranged forces.</li><li>Shoota Boy Pro: More elite and experienced than the normal shoota boyz, these are boyz are equipped with Rokkit Launchas.</li><li>Slugga Boyz: About the same size as Shoota boys but prefer close quarter combat. The most common type of Ork and the backbone of any proper WAAAGH. They form mobs and mostly blind rush their opposition. Though there are a few clever ones who wear protective gear even if a lot of the time it is ineffective against a Space Marine's bolter.</li><li>Slugga Boyz Pro: A more skilled version of the standard Slugga Boy, this Ork has cobbled himself some rudimentary armour and has thrown away his crude choppa for a more advanced chain weapon.</li><li>'Ard Boyz: 'Ard Boyz are more heavily armored than their Shoota or Slugga counterparts, and also have a natural resilience that makes them able to soak up fire that would destroy other members of their species. While the armor worn by the 'Ard Boyz is crude and usually made of salvaged metal, they also wield a heavy riot shield and choppa for up close encounters.</li><li>Slugga Nob: The Nobz are the ruling class of the Orks. These are Orks that have undergone so much combat that they have grown to superhuman sizes and strong enough to crush lesser Orks who would challenge them. They become impervious to attacks that would destroy lesser Orks and they use their size and strength to wield giant 2-handed choppas.</li><li>Slugga Nob Pro: Even stronger than his already enormous brethren, this Nob is capable of taking on even the most elite troops.</li><li>Shoota Nob: Similar to the Slugga Nob, the Shoota Nob is part of the ruling class of Orks. Unlike the Slugga Nobs, they favor big, loud guns over the close combat weapons used by their counterparts. The wealth of a Shoota Nob, accumulated from his years of combat, allows him to attain even bigger and louder weapons.</li><li>Shoota Nob Pro: An upgrade to the standard Shoota Nob, this Ork has upgraded his arsenal to include advanced weapons and armor.</li><li>Storm Boyz: These are Orks that favor close-combat like the Slugga Boyz, but also live for the thrill of speed. To attain this thrill they strap crude rocket jump packs onto their backs and gamble their lives in order to jump into the thick of combat at break-neck speeds.</li><li>Weirdboy: Weirdboyz are Ork psykers that harness the nearby WAAAAGH! energy of other Orks to unleash devastating psychic attacks. As well as offensive powers, more talented Weirdboyz posses the ability to teleport themselves and other Orks.</li><li>Warboss: All Orks are around the same size when they fully mature, however, it is only through fighting and survival that some grow to the truly enormous size of Nobz, the ruling caste. Occasionally, a truly exceptional Nob will rise to a position of dominance and command an entire Ork horde becoming a Warboss.</li></ul><p style=""><u><b>Chaos Space Marines</b></u></p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/72451/1843433-bloodletter_1.png" data-ref-id="1300-1843433" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="1.1420289855072" data-width="345" style="width: 345px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:114.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/72451/1843433-bloodletter_1.png" data-ref-id="1300-1843433"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/72451/1843433-bloodletter_1.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/72451/1843433-bloodletter_1.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Bloodletter Daemon of Khorne</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Renegade Militia: Human soldiers who have turned their backs on their species and sided with the ruinous powers of the Dark Gods. Many of them have gone insane with bloodlust from their activities worshipping their Chaos lords. Others dedicate themselves to Chaos in the hope of attaining more power. These renegades are equipped with lasguns and grenades but don't pose a significant threat to a well trained Space Marine.</li><li>Chaos Space Marine: Chaos Space Marines are the darker versions of the heroes of the game. They were once Space Marines as well, before falling to the tempting powers of Chaos. These Chaos Space Marines are brutally efficient and revel in deadly precision.</li><li>Havoc: These are the heavy weapons specialists in the forces of Chaos. Armed with heavy equipment like Heavy Bolters and Missile Launchers, they can cut down even the most heavily armored Space Marine. They can also be equipped with lascannons, autocannons, and plasma cannons.</li><li>Raptor: The Raptors are fast assault troops. They swoop down on their foes with their back-mounted jump packs. They possess basic sidearms and chain swords, in order to make it easier to cut down their foes in close combat.</li><li>Tainted Psyker: Psykers are humans who have psychic powers that allow them to call on the powers of the warp. These powers, however, come with the risk of attracting the influence of the daemons that inhabit the warp. Tainted Psykers are humans that have been driven mad by constant exposure to these influences. They can explode with warp power, creating portals that allow daemons to be summoned, or they can use their powers to protect themselves from enemy fire.</li><li>Chaos Drone: A large daemon-possessed aerial drone that possesses a heavy autocannon, these drones provide aerial support to the forces of Chaos. They can detect enemies behind any cover. The drone is a manifestation of the warp that is part flesh, part metal, and pure evil.</li><li>Bloodletter Daemon: The Daemonic servants of the Chaos god Khorne. They are summoned directly from the warp and their very presence is enough to strike fear and despair into the hearts of men. They wield vicious swords which can rend through the armor of even a Space Marine and they fight in packs which can 'warp' from location to location.</li><li>Chaos Lord: Lords are the most powerful of all their Chaos Space Marine brethren.

Instead, the game is built as a third- person shooter with a strong emphasis on easy use of melee combat with intense gunfights between <a href="../../adeptus-astartes/92-651/" rel="nofollow">Space Marines</a> and swarms of enemies as portrayed in <a href="../../games-workshop-ltd/65-1986/" rel="nofollow">Games Workshop</a> imagery. Gameplay also focuses on the use of classic weapons from the <a href="../../warhammer-40000/62-227/" rel="nofollow">Warhammer 40,000</a> fiction. Players have an ability that allows them to attempt to charge into enemy cover and positions, destroying terrain or damaging it. There is also a lite RPG-element to the game in which players are to be able to customize armour and weapons.</p><p style="">The weapons that are usable in game include:</p><ul><li>Bolter: A standard Space Marine weapon that fires explosive bolts.</li><li>Storm Bolter: Similar to a bolter, but with a higher rate of fire. Meant for use in heavy assaults.</li><li>Bolt Pistol: A sidearm version of the bolter. Standard for all Space Marines</li><li>Heavy Bolter: A chain fed heavy version of the bolter, capable of tearing through heavy armour.</li><li>Stalker Pattern Bolter: A scoped version of the bolter with penetrating rounds, great for sniping.</li><li>Plasma Gun: Can easily melt through enemy armour, but the user must vent the weapon or risk it over heating.</li><li>Plasma Pistol: A sidearm version of the plasma gun. Can be charged for a more powerful shot.</li><li>Plasma Cannon: Fires charged plasma shots that explode on impact.</li><li>Lascannon: Has the highest degree of armour penetration, making it an ideal anti-tank weapon.</li><li>Meltagun: Fires in an area-of-effect cone. Has limited range but it's power at close range is unmatched.</li><li>Adeptus Mechanicus Vengeance Launcher: Fires remotely detonated explosives that stick to any surface.</li><li>Frag Grenade: A standard space marine grenade. A useful anti-infantry weapon.</li><li>Chainsword: The standard Space Marine melee weapon. It's motorized teeth are capable of tearing through thick armour.</li><li>Power Axe: Uses focused energy fields around it's blades to cut through most physical matter.</li><li>Power Sword: Uses the same energy fields as the power axe, but sacrifices some of the strength of the power axe for speed.</li><li>Thunder Hammer: Builds up immense amounts of energy that is released on impact. Destroys everything in its area of effect.</li><li>Autocannon: A heavy cannon with rapidly reloading, explosive shells.</li></ul><h2>Multiplayer</h2><p style="">In <i>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine</i>, there are two multiplayer modes. You are able to play through the campaign in cooperative mode with a friend. Player one will presumably play as Captain Titus, but it isn't known who Player two will be controlling. In addition to the cooperative mode, you can play an 8v8 class-based competitive mode. There are three classes you can choose from on the side of the loyal Space marines or the traitorous Chaos Space Marines. You can gain experience in gameplay by getting kills and assists which will allow you to gain levels. There are also challenges associated with different weapons and will unlock perks for weapons or armor pieces to customize your space marine with. In the competitive multilplayer, there will be two different game modes. The first will be annihilation, which will be a standard team death match, with the winning team being whoever has the most kills. The second will be seize ground, in which the two teams will battle over objectives on the field that give points, and whichever team gains the most points will win.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/72451/1843742-space_marine_tatical.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1843742" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/72451/1843742-space_marine_tatical.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1843742"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/72451/1843742-space_marine_tatical.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/72451/1843742-space_marine_tatical.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Customization Options for the Tactical Marine class</figcaption></figure><p style="">Multiplayer Classes:</p><ul><li>Tactical Marine/Chaos Space Marine: The Tactical Marine is a well-rounded soldier, able to competently fight in both fire fights and melee combat.

The game is yet to be released overseas, but due to the Vocaloid software being a Japanese voice synth tool, popularity outside of Japan is little in comparison. </p> <p style=""> Those that ordered the special edition of the game received a petit nendoroid figurine of <a data-ref-id="3005-7367" href="/hatsune-miku/3005-7367/" slug="hatsune-miku">            Hatsune Miku</a>. </p> <p style=""> </p><h3>Gameplay</h3> <p style=""> As with typical rhythm games, points are earned by hitting notes to the beat of the music. Notes in Project DIVA come in two halves:</p> <p style=""> <b>Static Notes</b>: These will be the first to appear on the screen. They come in four different shapes, matching the <a data-ref-id="3045-18" href="/psp/3045-18/" slug="psp">           PSP</a> buttons. The notes also come with a ticker hand, starting at a 12 o’clock position and turning clockwise until again reaching a 12 o’clock position. It is at this point that the correct shape should be pressed.</p> <p style=""> <b>Moving Notes</b>: These will fly from off-screen and land on their respective static note counterpart. They are timed so that they will overlap perfectly when the ticker on the static notes reaches a 12 o’clock position. Pressing the correct button completes the note and you are awarded points accordingly. </p> <p style=""> The more accurate you are, the more points you will receive. This ranges from 0 (for a miss) to 500 points. The combo metre will also increase your score. Missing a note or pressing the wrong button will reset your combo. </p> <p style=""> In the bottom left of the screen is a sphere with a music note. This acts as a life meter of sorts, rising and emptying depending on how well you play. The song will end should the sphere deplete.</p> <p style=""> </p><h3>Songs</h3> <p style=""> The game ships with 39 songs split by different colour tags. The following songs are listed by their tag colour and their Japanese, Rōmaji  and English names.   Songs that seemingly only have an English name are called the same for all three. </p> <p style=""> </p><h3>Pink Tag Songs</h3><ul class="plain-list"><li>  ワールドイズマイン  - Warudo Izu Main - World is Mine</li><li>  ひねくれ者  – Hinekuremono - The Rebel</li><li>  恋は戦争  - Koi wa Sensou - Love is War</li><li>  その一秒スローモーション  - Sono Ichibyuo Suroumoushon - That One Second Slow Motion</li><li>  メルト  – Meruto – Melt</li></ul><p style=""> </p> <p style=""> </p><h3>Blue Tag Songs</h3><ul class="plain-list"><li> Far Away</li><li>  ストロボナイツ  – Sutorobonaitsu - Strobo Nights</li><li> Star Story</li><li> Last Night, Good Night</li><li> Packaged</li></ul><p style=""> </p> <p style=""> </p><h3>Orange Tag Songs</h3> <ul class="plain-list"><li> 雨のち Sweet*Drops - Ame Nochi Sweet*Drops - Sweet*Drops After the Rain</li><li>ミラクルペイント  - Mirakuru Peinto - Miracle Paint</li><li>フキゲンワルツ  - Fukigen Warutsu - Bad Mood Waltz</li><li>マージナル  – Maajinaru - Marginal</li><li>Dreaming Leaf - ユメミルコトノハ - - Dreaming Leaf - Yumemiru Kotonoha - - Dreaming Leaf -Dreaming Words-</li></ul> <p style=""> </p><h3>Yellow Tag Songs</h3> <ul class="plain-list"><li> 荒野と森と魔法の歌  - Kouya to Mori to Mahou no Uta - Song of Wastelands, Forests, and Magic</li><li>  荒野と森と魔法の歌 ( レン ver.) - Kouya to Mori to Mahou no Uta (Ren ver.) - Song of Wastelands, Forests, and Magic (Len ver.)</li><li>  荒野と森と魔法の歌 ( リン ver.) - Kouya to Mori to Mahou no Uta (Rin ver.) - Song of Wastelands, Forests, and Magic (Rin ver.)</li><li>  ハト  – Hato - Pigeon</li><li> moon</li><li>  みくみく菌にご注意 ♪  - Mikumiku-kin ni Gochuui ♪  - Beware of Miku Miku Bacteria ♪ </li><li>  いのちの歌  - Inochi no Uta - Song of Life</li><li>  いのちの歌 ( レン ver.) - Inochi no Uta (Ren ver.) - Song of Life (Len ver.)</li><li>  いのちの歌 ( リン ver.) - Inochi no Uta (Rin ver.) - Song of Life (Rin ver.) </li></ul> <p style=""> </p><h3>Sky Blue Tag Songs</h3> <ul class="plain-list"><li> The secret garden</li><li> Dear cocoa girls</li><li>  天鵞絨アラベスク  - Birodo Arabesuku - Velvet Arabesque</li><li>  ラブリスト更新中 ？  - Rabu Risuto Koushinchuu? - Updating Your Love List?</li><li>  桜ノ雨  - standard edit - - Sakura no Ame - standard edit - - Rain of Cherry Blossoms - standard edit –</li></ul><p style=""> </p> <p style=""> </p><h3>White Tag Songs</h3> <ul class="plain-list"><li> 恋スルＶＯＣ ＠ ＬＯＩＤ  - Koi Suru VOC@LOID - VOC@LOID in Love</li><li> Ievan Polkka</li><li>  あなたの歌姫  - Anata no Utahime - Your Diva</li><li>  えれくとりっく・えんじぇぅ  - Erekutorikku Enjyeu - Electric Angel</li><li>  初音ミクの消失  - Hatsune Miku no Shoushitsu - The Disappearance of Hatsune Miku</li><li>  金の聖夜霜雪に朽ちて  - Kogane no Seiya Sousetsu ni Kuchite - Golden Holy Night Rotting into the Frost and Snow</li><li>  みくみくにしてあげる ♪ 【してやんよ】 - Miku Miku ni Shite Ageru ♪ (Shite Yanyo) - I'll Make You Do the Miku Miku ♪  (You'll Do It) </li></ul> <p style=""> </p>           <br/><h3>Collectables</h3> <p style=""> As a reward for completing songs, players are often given items to decorate Miku's room with.
