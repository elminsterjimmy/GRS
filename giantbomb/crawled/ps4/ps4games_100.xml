(Tank upgrades will not persist between playthroughs, at least not in the way you'd think)</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/130684/2121827-tashop.png" data-ref-id="1300-2121827" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.80386740331492" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/130684/2121827-tashop.png" data-ref-id="1300-2121827"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/130684/2121827-tashop.png"></a></figure><p style="">If you were to get to the Moon (the second World) the game records your best run, so the best score you've gotten on Earth will be your starting score on the Moon, and the upgrades you had on that run will be your starting upgrades (if you choose to start your next game from World 2) It's a novel way of doing it and makes losing late on in the game not feel like so much of a step back.</p><p style="">The way lives are dealt with in Titan Attacks! is through the Shields, you have a bar at the top of the screen representing your shields and every hit you take removes a segment of that bar, there are pickups that can increase the bar during a wave, and you can purchase segments in the Store between waves.</p><p style="">Also for sale are 'Add-ons' which add extra guns to the sides of your Tank that fire periodically with your main gun. There are also your standard damage upgrades and smartbombs, the 'Xtra Bullets' allow for more than one bullet to be on screen at the same time (starting from 1).</p><h2>PC System

an overall goal of descending into Hell and defeating the sinister bosses lurking there.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Inspired by many of the developer's favourite games, most prominently <a href="../../minecraft/61-30475/" rel="nofollow">Minecraft</a>, Terraria is a <a href="../../2d/92-1427/" rel="nofollow">two-dimensional</a> side-scrolling action-adventure <a href="../../sandbox/92-453/" rel="nofollow">sandbox</a> game, with an emphasis on <a href="../../crafting/92-934/" rel="nofollow">crafting</a> and <a href="../../exploration/92-767/" rel="nofollow">exploration</a> of <a href="../../randomly-generated-maps/92-206/" rel="nofollow">randomly generated</a> worlds. Development started in January 2011, and was released through the <a href="../../steam/92-718/" rel="nofollow">Steam</a> platform on May 16, 2011. The game has only two credited authors at the moment, with Andrew "Redigit" Spinks as Game Creator/Programmer, and Jeremy "Blue" Guerrette as Production Assistant. The majority of the PR appears to be handled by "Blue" via the fan IRC channel (#terraria-fans on FOSSnet) and Twitter (@Terraria_Blue). The port to Wii U is developed by Engine Software while the Nintendo 3DS version is developed by Codeglue.</p><h2>Graphics</h2><p style="">The current graphics set for characters and weapons appears to be a throwback to the 16-bit era, particularly inspired by <a href="../../sprite/92-491/" rel="nofollow">sprites</a> from adventure and role-playing games. The blocky optical effect is achieved by using a square of 4 same-color pixels as the basic units for every sprite. The player and NPC sprites, are reminiscent of <a href="../../snes/60-9/" rel="nofollow">SNES</a> Final Fantasy character artwork. This is subject to change as creation of new artwork has been contracted out by the creators. Music as well appears to be inspired from the same era, and was also contracted out.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">Terraria invites the player to explore or dig for building materials, while also continually spawning monsters off-screen. The game challenges the player to immediately start to come up with solutions to questions of shelter, housing, protection, fast travel and ultimately aesthetics and automation. Different armors, weapons, equipment and access to NPCs and Bosses add RPG like progression and enable the player to seek out increasingly difficult depths and environments. Player characters can travel between different offline worlds and online servers, thus making all resources infinite, encouraging heedless creativity, rather than economical resource management.</p><p style="">The worlds in Terraria are <a href="../../randomly-generated-maps/92-206/" rel="nofollow">randomly generated</a> based on the size of the world selected by the player, with several defined Biomes:</p><ul><li>Forest</li><li>Snow Biome</li><li>Underground Layer</li><li>Cavern Layer</li><li>The Underworld</li><li>Corruption</li><li>Jungle and Underground Jungle</li><li>Dungeon</li><li>Ocean</li><li>Desert</li><li>Floating Islands</li><li>The Hallow and Underground Hallow (late game)</li><li>Meteorite</li><li>The Crimson (an alternative to The Corruption released in v1.2)</li></ul><p style="">Each zone spawns a specific set of monsters, treasure, ore, and/or plants. Some examples are: large glowing underground mushrooms, lakes filled with piranhas, <a href="http://wiki.terrariaonline.com/The_Corruption" rel="nofollow">The Corruption</a>, and Hell, filled with lava and dangerous monsters.</p><p style="">Water and lava exhibit dynamic properties and the creeping spread and grows of plants, crystals and even corruption and hallow add a shifting dynamic to the world almost beyond the player's ability to control it, every biome spawning unique monsters. There is also one <a href="../../randomly-generated-dungeons/92-167/" rel="nofollow">randomly generated dungeon</a> per world for the player to explore. Pots and <a href="../../treasure-chest/93-517/" rel="nofollow">treasure chests</a> will be randomly placed for players to find valuable accessories to equip with game-altering affects, such as a "Red Baloon" that increases jump height, or "Hermes Boots" that improve run speed.</p><h3>Crafting and Building</h3><p style="">Buildings and items are created using materials the players gather themselves from the world. Trees can be chopped down and replanted, and various types of dirt and ore can be gathered. Some <a href="../../crafting/92-934/" rel="nofollow">Crafting</a> stations are created by placing objects on or near each other (For example, placing flasks on a table makes an <a href="../../alchemy/92-1233/" rel="nofollow">Alchemy</a> station) while others such as Furnaces are crafted from other items and then placed on a flat surface</p><p style="">Certain items can be created anywhere:</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Picture</th><th>Item</th><th><u><b>Number received</b></u></th><th><u><b>Recipe</b></u></th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td><a href="/torch/3055-484/" data-ref-id="3055-484">Torches</a></td><td>3</td><td>1 Gel , 1 Wood</td><td>Used to light dark areas.

Health increases by finding and breaking open underground Heart Containers with a hammer, and then using the Life Crystal item inside for a permanant 20-point HP (to a cap of 400 HP) increase. Mana is increased by collecting 10 falling stars (which only appear at night), and combining them into a Mana Star, which increases maximum mana by 20 points (maximum mana caps out at 200).</p><p style="">Beyond those two stats, player advancement is accomplished by improving their equipment and accessories via exploration, discovery of chests, and destruction of monsters and bosses.</p><h3>NPCs</h3><p style="">NPCs are attracted to player-built structures based on certain conditions met by the players in the game. The NPCs are attracted by closed off rooms or "houses" that they can each claim as their own and can be assigned to different rooms via the housing interface. For example if all players have 50 silver, a merchant will appear. If a player has more than the default starting health, a nurse will appear.</p><p style="">The criteria for a "house" are:</p><ul><li>Side and back wall, floor, and ceiling. Back wall made out of something other than dirt or dungeon brick.</li><li>Must have a table/workbench and a chair.</li><li>Must have an exit, either a wood platform in the floor or ceiling or a door.</li><li>Must have a light source.</li><li>Must be at least 8 blocks wide and 4 blocks tall.</li></ul><p style="">The current NPCs are the <a href="/the-wizard/3005-21488/" data-ref-id="3005-21488">Wizard</a>, <a href="/the-tinkerer/3005-21487/" data-ref-id="3005-21487">Tinkerer</a>, <a href="/the-mechanic/3005-21486/" data-ref-id="3005-21486">Mechanic</a>, <a href="/the-merchant/3005-20768/" data-ref-id="3005-20768">Merchant</a>, <a href="/the-nurse/3005-20777/" data-ref-id="3005-20777">Nurse</a>, <a href="/the-arms-dealer/3005-20779/" data-ref-id="3005-20779">Arms Dealer</a>, <a href="/the-demolitionist/3005-20778/" data-ref-id="3005-20778">Demolitionist</a>, <a href="/the-dryad/3005-20780/" data-ref-id="3005-20780">Dryad</a>, <a href="/the-clothier/3005-20805/" data-ref-id="3005-20805">Clothier</a> and <a href="/the-guide/3005-20766/" data-ref-id="3005-20766">Guide</a> (which the world starts with). The general theme is that over time, the player can build a "town" from scratch to provide services to themselves and other players, and return to the town for supplies and healing.</p><h3>Monsters</h3><p style="">The are a multitude of monster types and variations in the game, including:</p><ul><li><a href="/slime/3015-264/" data-ref-id="3015-264">Slimes</a></li><li><a href="../../zombie/92-79/" rel="nofollow">Zombies</a></li><li><a href="../../skeletons/92-2293/" rel="nofollow">Skeletons</a></li><li><a href="/worm/3015-2795/" data-ref-id="3015-2795">Worms</a></li><li><a href="/demon-eye/3015-7212/" data-ref-id="3015-7212">Demon Eyes</a></li><li><a href="/goblins/3015-1593/" data-ref-id="3015-1593">Goblins</a></li><li><a href="/bats/3015-1688/" data-ref-id="3015-1688">Bats</a></li><li><a href="/demon/3015-557/" data-ref-id="3015-557">Demons</a></li><li>Fire Imps</li><li><a href="/piranhas/3015-3961/" data-ref-id="3015-3961">Piranhas</a></li><li>Man Eaters</li><li>Elementals</li><li>Giant Worms</li></ul><p style="">These are augmented by " <a href="../../bosses/92-229/" rel="nofollow">boss</a>" style creatures which can be summoned for battle under certain conditions, giving the player chances at useful in-game rewards and dropping materials necassary for progression onto higher tier items. Some examples are the <a href="/eye-of-cthulhu/3005-20854/" data-ref-id="3005-20854">Eye of Cthulhu</a>, <a href="/skeletron/3005-19124/" data-ref-id="3005-19124">Skeletron</a>, and the <a href="/eater-of-worlds/3005-20915/" data-ref-id="3005-20915">Eater of Worlds</a>.</p><h2>Multiplayer</h2><p style="">The game is designed with multiplayer in mind, so players can start a server and invite friends. Your character can be used in any of your worlds, and online servers as well. When starting a server, it can be hosted on any of your worlds. This can save a lot of repetition of advancing your character or world when wanting to play with friends. Flags exist for Player versus Player game modes, and you can choose a team color to set player damage. Certain items exist with player/terrain damage in mind, such as thrown grenades that only hurt players and bombs that damage both players and terrain.</p><h2>Tips</h2><ul><li>Platforms are extremely useful especially in the early game. they don't need a workbench and providing there's a wall in the backdrop, you can place it anywhere within reach. You can also jump through them and land on them which makes them more manageable than platforms made of blocks. Pressing down on the platform will allow you to drop off the platform</li><li>Whenever possible, a Grappling Hook (1 Hook, 3 Iron Chain) should be crafted to help navigate the environment. when going deeper underground or when exploring on the top level, there will be less and less areas where you can freely place platforms. The grappling Hook extends almost full screen and you are allowed to shoot it again while grappled which allows fast and effective terrain traversal. You can also use other items while grappled which is especially useful when placing torches in dark areas and mining minerals in hard to reach places.</li><li>If playing on a large server, you can keep track of where your friends are in the server by having them join one of the Red, Blue, Yellow, or White Party teams accessible in the inventory screen (ESC by default). This shows you where all party members of that color are from your location.</li><li>It can be helpful to build periodic "bases" in your deeper tunnels. Build a small house underground with a bed (which allows you to set a spawn point) so you do not have to climb back down if you accidentally die.</li></ul><h2>Updates</h2><p style="">Terraria has received a number of updates since release. These have included numerous improvements, such as: bug fixes, adjustable resolution in full screen, additional items, additional enemy types, console/dedicated-type server (no graphics card requirement), as well as Host&amp;Play (listen server) option.</p><p style="">Full patch notes for 1.0.3 can be viewed <a href="http://www.terrariaonline.com/threads/1-0-3-change-log.19653/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and for 1.0.4 <a href="http://www.terrariaonline.com/threads/1-0-4-change-log.25667/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and for 1.0.5 <a href="http://www.terrariaonline.com/threads/1-0-5-changelog.33191/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and for 1.0.6 <a href="http://www.terrariaonline.com/threads/50278" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and for 1.0.6.1 <a href="http://www.terrariaonline.com/threads/52843" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p><h3>Terraria 1.1</h3><p style="">Version 1.1 was released on December 1, 2011.

late-80s and early-90s cartoons.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Awesomenauts is a 2D multiplayer platformer developed by <a href="/ronimo-games/3010-6669/" data-ref-id="3010-6669">Ronimo</a> and published by <a href="/dtp-entertainment-ag/3010-36/" data-ref-id="3010-36">dtp</a> on May 1, 2012 for the <a href="/xbox-360/3045-20/" data-ref-id="3045-20">Xbox 360</a> (via <a href="/xbox-live-marketplace/3045-86/" data-ref-id="3045-86">Xbox Live Arcade</a> for 800 msp) and the <a href="/playstation-3/3045-35/" data-ref-id="3045-35">PlayStation 3</a> (via <a href="/playstation-network-ps3/3045-88/" data-ref-id="3045-88">PlayStation Network</a> for $9.99, free for <a href="/playstation-plus/3015-5817/" data-ref-id="3015-5817">PlayStation Plus</a> members). Influenced by the MOBA (<a href="/multiplayer-online-battle-arena/3015-6598/" data-ref-id="3015-6598">Multiplayer Battle Online Arena</a>) sub-genre, the game is set in the far future, where two factions (red and blue) send out mercenaries (the Awesomenauts) to battle each other in 3-on-3 scenarios. The game is noted for a strong late-80s, early-90s cartoon vibe, including wacky characters (including a futuristic cowboy and a <a href="/hip-hop/3015-2771/" data-ref-id="3015-2771">hip-hop</a> inspired frog humanoid) and cartoonish presentation.</p><p style="">It was later published by Ronimo for the <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC</a> (either directly from their website or from <a href="/steam/3015-718/" data-ref-id="3015-718">Steam</a>) on August 1, 2012, where it received numerous patches (including new playable characters). Players who purchased the Steam version before September 5th, 2012 also received cross-promotional cosmetic items for <a href="/team-fortress-2/3030-18162/" data-ref-id="3030-18162">Team Fortress 2</a>, including a badge with the Awesomenauts logo, a jetpack (for the <a href="/pyro/3005-481/" data-ref-id="3005-481">Pyro</a>) resembling Yuri's jetpack, and a combination of Lonestar's facial hair and hat (for the <a href="/sniper/3005-487/" data-ref-id="3005-487">Sniper</a>). It was also released for <a href="/mac/3045-17/" data-ref-id="3045-17">Mac</a> on December 6, 2012, making it cross-play compatible between PC and Mac.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">Awesomenauts has the standard starting elements that most MOBAs have. The game field is set with two bases at opposite ends of the map in this case the far left and far right. Extending outward from each of the bases are the lanes. In these lanes there are bushes to hide in to do stealth attacks platforms and moving platforms as well as areas for creeps. At predetermined areas sit <a href="/turret/3055-43/" data-ref-id="3055-43">turrets</a> that each team works to destroy throughout the course of each game.</p><p style="">Your profile gains levels as you play the game earning new item options, areas to play in and new characters to play as. There are currently 4 stages in total.</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Ribbit IV - This is the stage that is unlocked initially. It consists of 2 main paths with 2 turrets on each path per team. There is a jungle area that spawns up to 4 standard critters and 2 of the giant solarboss. The solarboss, unlike the standard critters, will attack players. There are several areas to hide in near the center of the map. There is also a jump pad at the bottom center of the map.</td></tr><tr><td>Sorona - This stage is unlocked at level 12. This stage consists of 2 main paths with 1 turret on each path per team, this funnels into a single final turret. The top area for each team holds the critter area. Only 2 critters spawn on each teams side. The spawn is initially protected by a team specific force field. However, once the final turret is destroyed, this force field disappears and enemies may use the upper path to gain entry to the oppositions drill. This stage also has an environmental hazard in the form of a giant worm. At the very bottom center of the stage there is a platform with a button. Standing on this button unleashes the worm to feast on any player or creep in the immediate area. Be careful as you can destroy your own team's creep or players with this.</td></tr><tr><td><p style="">AI Station 404 - This stage is unlocked at level 22. This stage consists of a single path that diverges and then re-converges. The middle of the map features a low gravity area above the turrets, and a critter area above that. The upper access to the critter area is protected by a force field that is also disabled when the first turret is destroyed. This stage is the only stage that contains special creep that can be released at the players discretion. These creep fly and use a ranged attack to fight against enemy turrets, creeps, and players. While they are more powerful than the standard creep, they do not receive the benefit of shields when approaching a turret.</p><p style="">Aigullion- This stage was initally introduced in Patch 1.17 and is exclusive to the Steam version. It consists of two paths with two turrets on each path per team. In the center is two critter areas with 8 critters in total and a new power up, the stealth power-up which grants the person who picks it up 30 seconds of invisibility.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="">Some of the key differences that set Awesomenauts apart from most other MOBAs is at the start of the match you choose which upgrades you want to purchase in the store. You are given 6 options that unlock over time to upgrade various parts of your character from movement speed to attack damage. Some of these can even add extra effects to your character allowing you to do more damage to your enemy or cripple them depending on the upgrade. To purchase these items you must gather solar which can be found scattered throughout every level as pick up items or gained from killing enemies, <a href="/creep/3015-2419/" data-ref-id="3015-2419">creeps</a> or turrets. When you spawn in the match either from the start of the game or when you respawn you are dropped from a space ship to the planet you are fighting on, when you are dropped you can move your <a href="/dropship/3055-640/" data-ref-id="3055-640">dropship</a> to pick up solar.</p><p style="">Solar gained from killing an enemy is shared by the entire team. The player the scores the kill earns 50 solar, while the other members of the team earn 25. The game only keeps track of kills and deaths with assists not being reflected in the games stats.</p><p style="">Some levels have special triggers such as a button that allows a giant worm to come out of the ground and kill anyone above instantly be them friend or foe.</p><p style="">If you get killed by a creep the game will state that you have been humiliated. While if you kill 3 people without dying it will say that you are dominating and play the character's theme song.</p><p style="">Each of the characters in the game is controlled with the left joystick and the A or X is used as the jump button similar to most side scrolling platforming games. The remaining 3 face buttons are the attack and special move actions. The special move actions must be unlocked from the store before you are able to use them. The d-pad can trigger taunts or requests for assistance from your team-mates.</p><h2>Characters</h2><p style="">Basic Unlocks:</p><ul><li><b>Power Pills</b> (3 stages) - Increases the player's maximum health by 30.

It is the first game in the franchise to be developed on <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/ea-digital-illusions-ce/3010-4880/" data-ref-id="3010-4880">DICE's</a> <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/frostbite-3-0/3015-7847/" data-ref-id="3015-7847">Frostbite 3</a> engine.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">Like previous Dragon Age games, Dragon Age: Inquisition is a dark-fantasy, <a href="/third-person-perspective/3015-464/" data-ref-id="3015-464">3rd person</a> action-RPG, baring similarities to its spiritual predecessor, the computer RPG <a href="/baldurs-gate-ii-shadows-of-amn/3030-10637/" data-ref-id="3030-10637">Baldur's Gate II</a>. Playable as one protagonist and three of nine interchangeable <a href="/ai-companion/3015-143/" data-ref-id="3015-143">A.I. companions</a> (which the player can also take control of at will). Both the protagonist and the companions are all either a <a href="/warriors/3015-2646/" data-ref-id="3015-2646">warrior</a>, a <a href="/rogues/3015-1460/" data-ref-id="3015-1460">rogue</a> or a <a href="/wizards/3015-1694/" data-ref-id="3015-1694">mage</a> class, with some personal abilities/spells distinguishing characters of the same class. Some abilities can be combined for increased effects.</p><h3>Combat</h3><figure data-ref-id="1300-2624938" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2624938-image_39839_fit_940.jpg" data-size="small" data-align="right" data-ratio="0.56276595744681" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2624938-image_39839_fit_940.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2624938"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2624938-image_39839_fit_940.jpg"></a><figcaption>Cassandra, Varric and Solas ready for battle</figcaption></figure><p style="">Rather than decide between <a href="/dragon-age-origins/3030-20738/" data-ref-id="3030-20738">Dragon Age: Origins</a>'s strategical combat or <a href="/dragon-age-ii/3030-30995/" data-ref-id="3030-30995">Dragon Age II</a>'s action oriented combat, Inquisition allows for both.

The protagonist and all companions accumulate focus into a single pool by doing damage to enemies.

The end goal will not be sexual relations dependant on an approval rating in which you can buy endless gifts for to raise (as was the case in previous games), but to develop bonds over time based on choices made and interactions with a given character.</p><p style="">Characters are not pansexual in Inquisition. All potential romances have specific sexualities and cannot be romanced by anyone outside of those preferences. Four characters are heterosexual, three characters are bisexual and two characters are homosexual.</p><h2>Characters</h2><h3>The Protagonist: The Inquisitor</h3><p style="">Players will play as a new protagonist with customizable race, class, gender, and appearance. This protagonist, <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/the-inquisitor/3005-27349/">the Inquisitor</a>, must save <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/thedas/3035-2495/" data-ref-id="3035-2495">Thedas</a> from itself by assuming control and building up an organization known as the Inquisition. The Inquisitor's quest will stretch across Thedas and into nations such as <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/ferelden/3035-2470/" data-ref-id="3035-2470">Ferelden</a> and Orlais.</p><p style="">Unlike <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/dragon-age-ii/3030-30995/" data-ref-id="3030-30995">Dragon Age II</a>, in which the player was restricted to playing as a human character named <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/hawke/3005-15911/" data-ref-id="3005-15911">Hawke</a>, Dragon Age: Inquisition brings back many of the customization options from the <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/dragon-age-origins/3030-20738/" data-ref-id="3030-20738">original game</a>'s protagonist, <a href="/the-warden/3005-14352/" data-ref-id="3005-14352">The Warden</a>. The player may choose to play as a human, elf, dwarf, or a <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/qunari/3015-6613/" data-ref-id="3015-6613">Qunari</a>--which is a first for the series--with the player's chosen race bearing some level of impact on the game's story and interactions with specific characters and groups.

Nothing you acquire in MP can be accessed in the single player mode.</p><h3>Multiplayer Characters</h3><p style="">The multiplayer characters are all agents of the Inquisition.</p><h4>Warriors</h4><p style=""><strong>The Katari</strong></p><ul><li>"Katari" means "One who brings death" in Qunlat. The Katari is a Tal-Vashoth mercenary who left the Qun in order to forge his own path. However, choosing one's way after being forced to follow orders is difficult. For the moment, the Katari makes his living as a sellsword, paid to fight for the Inquisition. His name is a description of what he does - While he has left the Qun, certain habits are hard to break.</li></ul><p style=""><strong>The Legionnaire</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Korbin</strong> is a highly regarded warrior from <a href="/orzammar/3035-2474/" data-ref-id="3035-2474">Orzammar</a> who volunteered for the Legion of the Dead. As a result of the alliance between the dwarven king and the Inquisition, Korbin now fights on the surface against Thedas's greatest threats.</li></ul><p style=""><strong>The Reaver</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Tamar</strong> is a fearsome warrior. She developed her abilities by consuming dragon blood. One of the cultists living in <a href="/haven/3035-2832/" data-ref-id="3035-2832">Haven</a>, she escaped the Chantry by fleeing into the mountains. Tamar was later captured by agents of the Inquisition and was given a choice: to serve or die. Execution in captivity would have been shameful. She'd rather die in battle; the blood of her enemies on her sword and a warcry on her lips.</li></ul><p style=""><strong>The Templar</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Belinda</strong> is a noble from Starkhaven and a recent initiate into the Templars, taking her vows just months before the Order split from the Chantry. Horrified to see the order she loved turn against the Chantry she believed in, she left the templars in order to stay loyal to the Divine. When Justinia V was killed, Belinda remained with the newly formed Inquisition, hoping to make things right.</li></ul><h4>Rogues</h4><p style=""><strong>The Alchemist</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Luka</strong> remembers the prison in the Vimmark Mountains: She was nobody, clearing out tunnels for the Carta, not important enough to know the truth about why they were there. She watched as the Carta descended into madness, never learning who was pulling the strings. When Hawke destroyed the prison, she was trapped, alone and forgotten. It took years, but she got out, using salvaged treasures to blast her own exit out to freedom. Then the Inquisition came calling, for they too remembered the prison, and what was kept there.</li></ul><p style=""><strong>The Archer</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Hall</strong> is a survivor from the Wilds. A Dalish hunter rescued him from a bandit raid when he was a child and taught him her skills. However, because he was human the Dalish sent him away when he could fend for himself. Hall wandered for years never quite finding his place. Seeing the beam of light tearing the sky he followed it and found purpose in the Inquisition.</li></ul><p style=""><strong>The Assassin</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Argent</strong> is named after the Orlesian word for quick silver. Trained from birth to be a weapon, she was often used as a bodyguard or an assassin by her various employers. Now the Inquisition is Argent's employer.</li></ul><p style=""><strong>The Hunter</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Thornton</strong> is a veteran Ranger. An experienced soldier, he has served different masters, lived through several wars, and always lived to tell the tale. What the Inquisition faces now, however, is altogether different and far more terrifying, and it will take everything he knows in order to get through it. But he will get through it, because Thornton always does.</li></ul><h4>Mages</h4><p style=""><strong>The Arcane Warrior</strong></p><ul><li>Like Neria, <strong>Cillian</strong> was born to the Ralaferian Clan. In his youth, he lived apart from his people in order to resurrect a lost art, that of the Arcane Warrior. Originally driven by the need to seek glory for his people, Cillian's years of meditation and solitude gave him wisdom and respect for all life. When The Breach opened, he knew his duty was to stand against it, fighting to save all he knows and loves.</li></ul><p style=""><strong>The Elementalist</strong></p><ul><li>Horrified by the abuses he saw in <a href="/kirkwall/3035-3232/" data-ref-id="3035-3232">Kirkwall</a>, <strong>Rion</strong> was one of the first mages of his Circle tower to take up the flag of rebellion. Seeing the amount of lives that the Mage Templar War had taken, he went to Heaven to await the Divine's outcome but when the temple was destroyed, his hope for resolution was lost. Rion signed up with the Inquisition; seeing it as the mages last chance for peace.</li></ul><p style=""><strong>The Keeper</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Neria</strong> was born into the Ralaferin clan, and was chosen as Keeper Elindra's apprentice. Trained from youth to defend and serve people, she takes great pride in her magic and her role as Elindra's First. Now within the Inquisition as a Dalish emissary, Neria does all she can to see that the interests of the Dalish are not forgotten amidst the chaos.</li></ul><p style=""><strong>The Necromancer</strong></p><ul><li>Raised in secret in Nevarra by a Mortalitasi mage, <strong>Sidony</strong> was brought up to revel in her magical abilities. She feels no kinship with mages who do not share her pride, and she has little but disdain for most other people. Sidony's only goal is to uncover her true potential as a mage, so she hungers for magical knowledge. When news of The Breach reached her, she headed directly to see it for herself, hoping that whatever secrets it held would be the key to her advancement.</li></ul><h2>Downloadable Content</h2><p style="">Inquisition will not be using BioWare Points from BioWare's website, all <a href="/downloadable-content/3015-329/" data-ref-id="3015-329">DLC</a> will be purchasable and accessed through EA's <a href="/origin/3015-7040/" data-ref-id="3015-7040">Origin</a>.</p><h2>Development</h2><p style="">Dragon Age: Inquisition was confirmed to be in development following a post from executive producer Mark Darrah on September 17th, 2012, and has been in development since 2010.</p><p style="">Like its predecessors, Dragon Age: Inquisition will be set in <a href="/thedas/3035-2495/" data-ref-id="3035-2495">Thedas</a> and will feature a new protagonist.

The game will be set after Dragon Age II and the novel Dragon Age: Asunder, in which both the magi of Thedas and the Seekers of Truth, leading the Templar Order, have broken off from the Chantry and prepare to go to war with each other.</p><p style="">On the BioWare panel at Edmonton Comic &amp; Entertainment Expo 2012, creative director <a href="/mike-laidlaw/3040-97003/" data-ref-id="3040-97003">Mike Laidlaw</a> stated that "customization is going to be bigger than Dragon Age: Origins", and also include "follower customization". On the same panel, lead writer <a href="/david-gaider/3040-29916/" data-ref-id="3040-29916">David Gaider</a> mentioned that "You will be human", and that "backgrounds will be in Dragon Age 3 even though you will be human, it's not playable but it does significant impact on the story". (Gaider's words were later contradicted when Bioware revealed in August of 2013 that the player will, in fact, be able to play as an elf or dwarf.) Cinematic designer John Perry also stated that "he's had a longer pre-production on DA3 than any other BioWare project he's worked on". Perry also mentioned that "just one level in DA3 is as big as all of DA2's levels combined".</p><figure data-ref-id="1300-2541615" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2541615-dsc04732.jpg" data-size="small" data-align="right" data-ratio="0.66551126516464" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:66.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2541615-dsc04732.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2541615"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2541615-dsc04732.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2541615-dsc04732.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>BioWare demonstrating DA:I at PAX East 2014</figcaption></figure><p style="">At <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/e3-2013/3015-7534/" data-ref-id="3015-7534">E3 2013</a>, the first Dragon Age: Inquisition trailer was released with Dragon Age: Origins character Morrigan (voiced again by <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/claudia-black/3040-89736/" data-ref-id="3040-89736">Claudia Black</a>) narrating over war-zones featuring unspoken appearances by Dragon Age II characters Varric Tethras and Cassandra Pentaghast.

Players control a ball that must collect musical notes and complete levels. There are five "albums" of levels to complete in the Campaign, as well as Death Mode challenges, a full level editor, and the ability to play levels made by the community.</p><p style="">Many artists collaborated on the development of the game, such as <a href="/joel-zimmerman/3040-97568/" data-ref-id="3040-97568">Deadmau5</a>, <a href="/beck-hansen/3040-102403/" data-ref-id="3040-102403">Beck</a>, and <a href="/craig-adams/3040-99184/" data-ref-id="3040-99184">Superbrothers</a>.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2290270-sound_shapes_e3_2012_023_1338961115.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2290270" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2290270-sound_shapes_e3_2012_023_1338961115.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2290270"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2290270-sound_shapes_e3_2012_023_1338961115.jpg"></a><figcaption>Coming into contact with anything red will kill the player</figcaption></figure><p style="">Sound Shapes plays in a very similar manner to many <a href="/games/?sort=release_date&amp;filter_type=genre&amp;filter_value=41/">2D platformers</a>, with the main exception being that the player, a ball that vaguely resembles a floating eye, adheres to many surfaces. Rather than scrolling, levels are arranged as a collection of screens (and it is possible to return to previous screens). Players start at a record player entrance, and must find the record player exit to complete the level.</p><p style="">The player's ball must jump around, dodging hazards while collecting as many musical notes as possible. Hazards, defined as "anything red," operate in rhythm with the music; along with non-harmful level elements like platforms and friendly creatures, they contribute to the level's soundscape. The collectible music notes add to the soundscape as well, creating a song from the level itself. Each note plays on the screen it is collected and up to two screens away from it. Players can possibly miss collecting some of these notes; when a level is completed, players are scored on the notes collected and the time taken to complete the level. Completing the level with all notes collected unlocks elements used in that level for use in the Level Editor.</p><p style="">When all levels in the main campaign have been completed, Death Mode is unlocked. Each level has a Death Mode equivalent, which is a grueling single-screen challenge to collect a certain number of randomly-located notes within a specific amount of time that is akin to the "Grab X Bananas" bonuses from <a href="/donkey-kong-country-3-dixie-kongs-double-trouble/3030-4547/" data-ref-id="3030-4547">DKC3</a>. Each Death Mode level has an associated <a href="/playstation-trophies/3015-198/" data-ref-id="3015-198">Trophy</a>.</p><p style="">At any time, players can play Community-made levels made using the game's Level Editor. Players can follow certain level creators to keep up to date with their levels, and can also view the most popular and most played levels. Using the game's Community website (<a href="http://www.soundshapesgame.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.soundshapesgame.com</a>), players can also queue up levels to play later on the <a href="/playstation-3/3045-35/" data-ref-id="3045-35">PS3</a> or <a href="/playstation-vita/3045-129/" data-ref-id="3045-129">Vita</a>.</p><h2>Level Editor</h2><p style="">The Sound Shapes editor is the same tool used by the game's designers to create the levels within the game. Elements such as game objects, enemies, notes, etc. are unlocked by completing the Campaign levels. Items can be placed, resized, rotated, and otherwise manipulated; if the item produces a sound (for instance, an enemy that fires a laser), the tempo and pattern of the item's effect can also be modified. On the <a href="/playstation-vita/3045-129/" data-ref-id="3045-129">Vita</a>, many of these editing functions make use of the rear touchscreen.</p><p style="">Before a level can be completed, the creator must be able to complete it as a player at least once. The level can then be uploaded to the Sound Shapes servers where it can be played and rated by other Sound Shapes players. Levels created on the <a href="/playstation-vita/3045-129/" data-ref-id="3045-129">Vita</a> are playable on the <a href="/playstation-3/3045-35/" data-ref-id="3045-35">PS3</a>, and vice-versa.</p><p style="">When all the Campaign levels have been completed, Beat School is unlocked. These are simple challenges requiring the player to recreate a beat, chord, or audio loop by placing notes within the play area. It requires one to listen closely to the audio and tempo to decipher which notes produce which sounds at which points. Each Beat School challenge has an associated <a href="/playstation-trophies/3015-198/" data-ref-id="3015-198">Trophy</a>.</p><h2>Downloadable Content</h2><p style="">Around the time of the game's release, Queasy Games confirmed incoming downloadable content for Sound Shapes.</p><ul><li><b>Acoustic Sound Pack</b> ($0.99): This pack includes five new instruments usable in the level editor. It includes a mix of instruments such as guitars, piano and kalimba.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Drum Kit Sound Pack</b> ($0.99): A series of new drum sounds that can be added to custom levels.

Players control one of four different kinds of ships, and do battle on the British Colonial Mars against the evil Spanish Empire and their alien overlords. By collecting gold and powering up using the "vaunt" system, players shield themselves and navigate through bullet hell to push back the Spanish Empire and destroy the alien menace. The game was updated on November 10, 2011 with additional DLC, called the "Gunpowder, Treason, and Plot" DLC, which provided three additional ship types, and made the soundtrack available for download on the Steam service.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style="">The year is 1619, and your character is Raleigh, a criminal sentenced to death by the King of England at the Tower of London. Naturally, as a criminal who is wrongly charged, you wish to clear your name by performing the heroic feat of travelling to Mars and investigating the disappearance of the Roanoke Colony. The story takes place very quickly, over just a few days, as the war between the British and the Spanish follows Raleigh to Mars. Raleigh quickly discovers the planet's secrets, and discovers exactly what the Spanish are up to on the Red Planet.</p><h4>Chapter 1: War Upon The East Frontier</h4><p style=""><i>War Upon The East Frontier, in which a settlement is ravaged by be-tentacled martians, loyal to the Spanish, and a villain appears!</i></p><p style="">Your character fights at the East Frontier, above the edge of the Jamestown colony. You do battle with the forces of the Spanish Armada and Martian flying saucers. Eventually, the Martian Prince gets tired of your antics, and attempts to defeat you with many bullets. Thankfully, he is unsuccessful. This is an introductory level, and eventually, Raleigh finds John Smith<i>.</i></p><h4><b>Chapter 2: Journey Through the Dark Sector</b></h4><p style=""><i>Journey Through the Dark Sector, in which Raleigh is pursued by the vigilant Spanish border guard, and the awful truth stands revealed!</i></p><p style="">Raleigh finds himself attacked by Spanish fighter planes, before arriving at the site of Roanoke, which has been attacked by a giant tentacle monster! Tentacles! Why'd it have to be tentacles? Then he proceeds to fight the giant monster living under the colony, before eventually fighting the heart of the monster itself. Once you do that, you rescue Virginia, a girl with a request that, if fulfilled, will pardon you in England (on Earth. You know, that planet over there with the water and the leaves and life.)</p><h4>Chapter 3: Prisoner of the Badlands</h4><p style=""><i>Prisoner of the Badlands, in which a prison break is effected by simply attacking the prison and all its robotic guards in broad daylight, and Roanoke's last survivor shares a vital clue.</i></p><p style="">You attempt to free Virginia's father from a giant robot prison by, attacking everything in the middle of the day. After being a hero, you reach the prison, which is actually the level's boss. By attacking its weak points for massive damage, it explodes, revealing the father (how does he not die in the explosion?) and allowing you to find out what the Conquistador is really up to.</p><h4>Chapter 4: Secret Mines of New Madrid</h4><p style=""><i>Secret Mines of New Madrid, in which Raleigh races time to prevent a foul desecration of Mars itself, and the villain shows his hand.</i></p><p style="">There are mining trains on Mars! Who'd have thought? Blowing them up gets you gold, and you fight your way over many well-armored trains that are attempting to attack you as you make your way to the Conquistador. When the tracks align, the real weapon appears; a giant drill train headed straight to the heart of Mars! If the Spanish can't have it, then clearly the British can't have it either. You blow up the majority of the train, leaving the drill without enough power to destroy Mars itself, but damage an ancient Martian temple, just enough to get inside. And ancient Martians don't like it when you go around cracking their temples open with giant drill trains...</p><h4>Chapter 5: The Lost Temple of Croatoa</h4><p style=""><i>The Lost Temple of Croatoa, in which the most ancient sanctuary of a forgotten Martian culture is awakened, and made very angry, and the Conquistador goes all in!</i></p><p style="">Raleigh fights through the Martian temple, following behind the Conquistador. The Martians don't like him, and proceed to activate all the defense systems in an attempt to eradicate him. When Raleigh finally reaches the temple's inner sanctum, he finds the Conquistador, with yet another surprise in store. The Conquistador merges with the ancient Martian, becoming the Heart of Mars! Only by defeating the Conquistador and restoring Mars to a balanced state can Jamestown finally be at peace.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">In Jamestown, you shoot down the enemies approaching the bottom of the screen using two different types of fire: standard and alt-fire. Each of these types of attacks varies between the four ships you can choose to fly. In team games with up to four people, everyone can pick any combination of ships. The goal of the game is to get as many points as possible. When enemies are destroyed, they drop gold that can be collected for points.</p><h3>Ship Selection</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/28692/1811289-2011_06_12_00005.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1811289" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/28692/1811289-2011_06_12_00005.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1811289"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/28692/1811289-2011_06_12_00005.jpg"></a><figcaption>Ship selection.</figcaption></figure><ul><li><b>Laser (Standard)</b>: Unlocked at the beginning of the game. The standard fire is a light-damage spread shot. The alt fire is a heavy-damage forward beam, and causes the ship to slow down. This is useful for new players in aiding in bullet dodging.</li><li><b>Gunner (Advanced)</b>: Unlocked for 2000 credits in the store. The standard fire is a light-damage straight shot and a rotatable crescent beam. The alt-fire fires both weapons as well, but turns the crescent beam to fire in the direction you move, allowing it to swing and shoot in any direction.</li><li><b>Charge (Standard)</b>: Unlocked at 4000 credits in the store. The standard fire is a light-damage straight shot. The alt-fire is a ball that charges up automatically, pierces through enemies and walls, and does a lot of damage.</li><li><b>Bomber (Advanced)</b>: Unlocked at 8000 credits in the store. The standard fire is a very light-damage single shot. The alt-fire detonates all of your bullets on the screen, causing them to do a high amount of splash damage around them.</li><li><b>Gunpowder (Standard)</b>: Unlocked at the beginning of the game if you own the GTP DLC. The standard fire is a light-damage forward shot. Over time, you stock rotation "option" barrels that attack with you. Pressing alt-fire throws one of the explosive barrels forward, and it explodes doing area damage at a set distance from you.</li><li><b>Treason (Standard)</b>: Unlocked at 2000 credits in the store, and if you own the GTP DLC. The standard fire is a medium-damage forward shot. Tapping the alt-fire shoots a single homing missile. Holding the alt-fire lowers your speed, and stocks up to four homing missiles. Releasing alt-fire shoots all the homing missiles.</li><li><b>Ghost (Advanced)</b>: Unlocked at 8000 credits in the store, and if you own the GTP DLC. This ship has two modes. In the first, you have a standard spread shot, doing moderate damage to targets in the middle of the firing line. When you press alt-fire, you create a ghost that shoots forward and has a spread shot behind that remains at that location, and you have a very high damage short range "sword". When you press alt-fire again, the ghost will move from its current location to your location. You can double-tap alt-fire to return the ghost to you, and return to the standard spread shot.</li><li><b>Fortune (Advanced)</b>: Unlocked at 25000 credits in the store, and if you own the GTP DLC. It's a mystery ship! It can mimic and become any of the other ships.</li></ul><h3>Vaunt System</h3><p style="">The vaunt system is key to getting a good high score in the game. When in normal mode, your bullets do normal damage. As you collect gold, you fill up a vaunt meter. Once you fill it up, further gold gains do not increase the meter beyond the max. When vaunt mode is activated, you gain a large anti-bullet shield around your ship that disappears after about a second. While vaunt is activated, the vaunt meter drains constantly, but you can extend the length of your active vaunt by collecting more gold. While in vaunt, your bullets do 150% damage, and all point gains are doubled. Also, when your vaunt ends naturally (as in your vaunt meter runs out), you gain an additional chain bonus for the total duration of your vaunt. While in vaunt mode, you can prematurely end your vaunt by pressing the vaunt button again, which creates a very small anti-bullet shield, and greatly reduces the chain bonus for your vaunt.</p><h3>Ranking System/Scoring</h3><p style="">You ranking is based on points, summarized by stars. Much like other games, a number of stars indicates your current performance in the level, and also displays the amount of points you need to get to the next amount of stars. The end of level bonus the player receives is also incorporated into the final score and star count.</p><h3>Judgement Day (Unlockable Difficulty)</h3><p style="">The game's final difficulty, Judgement, unlocks once you have beaten every level on Divine. It becomes available in the shop for 5,500 gold. Aside from throwing many multitudes of extra bullets at you, the game has the worst trick in store for you; unshieldable bullets! Bullets in green cannot be destroyed by vaunt; you'll have to dodge them the old-fashioned way, by navigating your tiny pixel-hitbox between the tiny spaces left for you.</p><h3>Co-op Play</h3><p style="">There are a few differences for Co-op play. Firstly, there are more ships on the screen. (Duh.) Secondly, <b>your vaunt score bonuses all stack.</b> you'll get x2 for one player vaunting, x4 for three players, and x8 for four players. All points earned by all players will earn the current score bonus, meaning in co-op, you'll want to work with your buddies and all vaunt at the same time. The enemies <b>also have more health</b>, but just how much isn't explicitly mentioned. Just know you'll need to group everyone up for some sections, and spread them out for others. Other mechanics are unchanged, although there are some team strategies that will help improve your co-op play, like one player using their vaunt shield to protect another player, etc.</p><p style="">Death in co-op will assuredly happen, and it's handled differently. Co-op players <b>will respawn on a short timer</b>, which increases with every death. <b>If all players are downed at the same time, it's game over.</b> You can also collect "Revive" powerups, which immediately respawn either one or all of your downed teammates. If you activate the unlockable Hardcore Mode in the shop, it only affects teamplay; there will no longer be an auto revive timer. <b>The only way to revive is to have your allies pick up a revive powerup.</b></p><h2>Story Mode</h2><p style="">The game has five chapters, and a gauntlet. By default, the game gives you three credits, each with three lives. Chapter 1 and 2 can be played on any difficulty, Chapter 3 can only be played if all previous levels have been beaten on Difficult difficulty or higher, Chapter 4 and the Final Stage can only be played if all previous levels have been beaten on the Legendary difficulty or higher.</p><h4>Chapter Availability/Difficulty Chart</h4><table class="t-editor with-border full-width"><thead><tr><th>Stage # and Name</th><th>Normal</th><th>Difficult</th><th>Legendary</th><th>Divine</th><th>Judgement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Stage 1: East Frontier</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Unlockable</td></tr><tr><td>Stage 2: Dark Sector</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Unlockable</td></tr><tr><td>Stage 3: The Badlands</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Unlockable</td></tr><tr><td>Stage 4: New Madrid</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Unlockable</td></tr><tr><td>Stage 5: Croatoa</td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Unlockable</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Normal Mode</h3><p style="">Normal mode is an easier portion of the game. The game defaults to three lives per credit, and grants three credits, for a total of nine lives. When the player selects a level, they select their difficulty. Your credits are reset per level<b>,</b> netting you a total of nine lives for each stage. You can pick any difficulty for any of these levels.</p><h3>Gauntlet Mode</h3><p style="">This is the typical shooter mode. The game defaults to three lives per credit, and grants you three credits. However, credits do not reset in this mode<b>.</b> This is three credits for the entire game, progressing through the stages. If you select a difficulty where a level is not available, then the gauntlet ends after that level<b>.</b> This means Normal gauntlets end after Stage 3: The Badlands, and Difficult gauntlets end after Stage 4: New Madrid.</p><h3>Bonus Levels/Challenge Packs</h3><p style="">These levels are packs that are purchased from the store (with ducats). The first four challenges begin unlocked, but you must play these first four challenges before unlocking the rest. These challenges force you to play the game very carefully to achieve the desired goal. There are a few common themes to the levels:</p><ul><li><b>Bullet Hell Survival</b> puts the focus on surviving dire situations for a set amount of time.</li><li><b>Ring Flying</b> forces you to fly through all the rings in a given level while still fighting enemies.</li><li><b>Score Attack</b> forces the player to find out the tricks and gimmicks of a level, getting enough score to pass the level and killing enemies in special ways to make them worth more points.</li></ul><h2>The Shoppe</h2><h3>Getting Ducats</h3><p style="">You get ducats for every game you play in Jamestown. You'll earn a set amount for each stage; harder stages award more ducats. You'll then get a percentage of the base, depending on how far you got based on % completion, with 100% completion netting you 100% of the ducats. Multiply this gold by a difficulty modifier, and then double everything if you beat the boss.</p><p style=""><i>Ducats Earned = (Base Level, 75) * (Completion Percentage, 0-100%) * (Difficulty Multiplier, x1, x2, x3, x4, x5) * (Boss Defeated, x2)</i></p><h2>PC System Requirements</h2><ul><li><b>OS:</b> Microsoft Windows XP with SP2 / Vista / 7</li><li><b>Processor:</b> Intel Pentium 4 2.4 GHz or better</li><li><b>Memory:</b> 512 MB RAM</li><li><b>Hard Disk Space:</b> 250 MB</li><li><b>Video Card:</b> Any OpenGL 2.0 graphics card with 256MB+ video RAM</li><li><b>DirectX:</b> DirectX 9.0c</li><li><b>Additional:</b> One keyboard, controller, or mouse required per player.

From this point, Kat pledges to help the city fight off this phantom menace.</p><p style="">Kat performs a number of odd jobs, like finding a place to live, until she is recruited again by Syd to protect a sacred gem, a gem that was the last protective measure against the Navi. Syd tells Kat to sneak past the policemen who had been guarding the stone, switch it out for a fake, and return the real sacred gem to Syd for safe keeping. Upon doing this, Syd is revealed to be a man named <a href="/alias/3005-20434/" data-ref-id="3005-20434">Alias</a> in disguise who absorbs the power of the sacred gem and runs off. The real Syd then stumbles out of the pushes, presumably knocked out by Alias.</p><p style="">After her counter with Alias, Kat stumbles across a fortune teller who sends her on a hunt to find her Mr. Destiny. After following the clues, she meets an old man named Gade who claims that he is the creator of the world. Kat is skeptical about the old man's claims, but he opens his coat, exposing a portal to another dimension where one of the missing districts of the city is. Kat battles the Navi there to restore the lost section. Upon returning, Raven threatens her, but is calmed by Gade, allowing Kat a chance to slip past.</p><figure data-ref-id="1300-1892176" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/79994/1892176-gd14.jpg" data-size="small" data-align="left" data-ratio="0.66666666666667" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:66.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/79994/1892176-gd14.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1892176"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/7/79994/1892176-gd14.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/7/79994/1892176-gd14.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Dastardly Alias.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Kat continues to help citizens around the city until Gade decides that it's time to retrieve another piece to of the city. Upon returning from the other dimension, Kat is contacted by Syd to once again protect a sacred gem. The plan to protect it fails when Alias discovers there covert operation and steals the second gem. However, being that Kat is now significantly stronger, she fights Alias and prevails. But, as a result of fusing with a Navi, Alias dies. Kat then enters the strange dimension within the old man's coat to restore the third district of the city. Once inside she finds Raven who opposes her restoration project. The two fight, but ultimately Kat exhausts Raven and returns with the last piece of the city. Unfortunately, a myriad of Navi follow Kat back to the real world and are only overcome once the newly strengthened military pushes them back.</p><p style="">With the town finding a new level of equilibrium, Kat decides to find the most trivial problem she can help with and stumbles upon a girl who dropped a letter over the edge of the city. Kat begins to travel down the pillar that the city is built around and gets closer and closer to a black storm which brews at the bottom of the known world. As she begins to reach the bottom, she is again accosted by Raven. The two tussle, but their fight is cut short by the loud growls of something below them. Kat blacks out, only and awakes inside a cage surrounded by children.</p><p style="">She breaks out and aids her captors when the Navi begin attacking. Seeing that she isn't there to hurt them, the children reveal that their bus had long ago fallen from the city and landed near the bottom of the pillar where they found the ruins of an old village. Raven again shows up, but this time reveals that she had been opposing Kat because the up and coming mayor D'nelica had vowed to help her rescue the lost children if she prevented the various districts from being restored. Kat then promises Raven and the kids to get them back to Hekseville.</p><p style="">Searching for a way back, Kat meets Cyanea, one of the lost children separated from the village. Cyanea is asleep, but in this state reveals herself to also be a creator. She transports Kat to a dream like world where it is implied that Kat is far more important than previously stated, possibly implying royalty. This spirit walk gives Kat greater insight into the world, including a way out for the children in the form of a door into the Ark, a large flying tower like structure. The children enter the Ark, but are attacked by a powerful Navi named Nushi. Kat subdues Nushi, allowing Raven and the Ark to begin the journey home.</p><p style="">Kat begins to scale the pillar to return to Hekseville, but when arrives there, finds out a year has passed since she was last there. In that span of time, D'nelica had become mayor and turned the city into a police-state, but mysteriously Raven and the Ark had never arrived. Finding herself exhausted from the recent events, Kat returns home to rest. During her rejuvenating slumber, Kat has a dream where Dusty splits into multiple cats and faces Alias again. She collects the split Dusty and Alias removes his mask to reveal himself to Kat, but not the player.</p><figure data-ref-id="1300-2442967" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/17/173913/2442967-2013-02-24-191207.jpg" data-size="small" data-align="right" data-ratio="0.56666666666667" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/17/173913/2442967-2013-02-24-191207.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2442967"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/17/173913/2442967-2013-02-24-191207.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/17/173913/2442967-2013-02-24-191207.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Kat on being told she is to be incarcerated.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The next day, the city's population is called downtown for the reveal of Angelica’s ultimate weapon against the Navi: Sea Anemone, a floating globe loaded with guns and missiles. Upon this proclamation, the city deems that shifters are no longer necessary and Kat is to be arrested. She is captured, but shortly after the Sea Anemone turns against the city, who now sees that it has a Navi core inside. Cyanea shows up and frees Kat and Dusty allowing them to confront the monster before them. Kat is aided by the military agent who had just arrested her, but together they can't beat it. Appearing to aid them is Gade, who asks Kat to use her power on him. From within his coat suddenly emerges the missing Ark along with Raven. Together, Kat, Raven, and the military agent are able to beat the corrupted Sea Anemone. Though the game does not end with an explicit sequel hook, the credits do hint at a number of unanswered questions, such as Kat's origin.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">The main gameplay feature of the game is Kat's ability to control <a href="/gravity/3015-1601/" data-ref-id="3015-1601">gravity</a>. This mechanic can be used in both traversal and combat. By pressing a button Kat can float in the air while the player chooses a new center of gravity by aiming with either the right analog stick or gyroscope and pressing a button to fly towards the new "ground" which Kat will be able to walk freely on from that point on. At any time the player can reset the gravity back to normal or choose a new "ground".Kat is also able to navigate her environment through “gravity sliding.” In theory, gravity sliding has Kat shifting the gravity to pull her forwards and down, resulting in a motion that looks similar to skiing. Practically, the player puts their their thumbs on the bottom corners of the screen and tilting the vita the direction they wish to go and quickly raising the Vita to jump. One can also drift by removing one thumb and tilting. All of these shifting abilities do use up the gravity gauge presented in the HUD and once it reaches zero, Kat's relationship will return to normal and she will fall to the ground.</p><p style="">When It comes to combat, Kat's primary attacks are a basic kick attack that is used while standing on a surface and a flying kick that utilizes her shifting ability. The standard kick attack can be used indefinitely, but the kick is limited by the gravity gauge. As the story progresses, three special attacks are unlocked. The use of these attacks is not governed by the gravity gauge, but rather all three are linked to a singular cool down. Though none of these special attacks are necessary, they do far greater damage than the standard attacks.</p><p style="">Lastly, Kat is able to pick up objects and bring them into her gravitational field. She is then able to travel with them or launch them towards targets. This can be used for combat or to transport people and objects around the city.</p><p style="">The player is able to upgrade Kat's abilities, attacks, and health by spending precious gems. These gems are acquired through challenges around the city (time trials, rescuing citizens, etc.), defeating enemies, and pick ups around the environments. Although the limit to which Kat's ability can be improved is capped at the start of the game, this can be raised by completing the aforementioned challenges and by advancing the story.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>35617</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/2160624-box_grush.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/2160624-box_grush.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/2160624-box_grush.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/2160624-box_grush.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/2160624-box_grush.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2160624-box_grush.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/2160624-box_grush.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Gravity Rush]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>7</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-36/]]></api_detail_url><id>36</id><name><![CDATA[PEGI: 12+]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-1/]]></api_detail_url><id>1</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: T]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-27/]]></api_detail_url><id>27</id><name><![CDATA[CERO: C]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2012-02-09 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-129/]]></api_detail_url><id>129</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation Vita]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-vita/3045-129/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[VITA]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-143/]]></api_detail_url><id>143</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation Network (Vita)]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-network-vita/3045-143/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PSNV]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/]]></api_detail_url><id>146</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 4]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS4]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/gravity-rush/3030-35617/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[Killer Freaks from Outer Space

The title refers to Ubisoft's first release, a 1986 computer game simply called <a href="/zombi/3030-18449/" data-ref-id="3030-18449">Zombi</a>. ZombiU was released on November 18, 2012 in North America as a launch title for <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/wii-u/3045-139/" data-ref-id="3045-139">Wii U</a>. <a href="http://www.comicvine.com/antony-johnston/26-40619/">Comic book-writer</a> <a href="/antony-johnston/3040-98248/" data-ref-id="3040-98248">Antony Johnston</a>, who also wrote several of the games in the <a href="/dead-space/3025-1229/" data-ref-id="3025-1229">Dead Space series</a>, worked on ZombiU's story along with co-writer and story designer <a href="/gabrielle-shrager/3040-103059/" data-ref-id="3040-103059">Gabrielle Shrager</a>. A port of the game--simply titled Zombi-- developed by Straight Right for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One was officially announced on July 30, 2015 and set for release on August 18, 2015 as a digital-only title.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3><b>Single Player</b></h3><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2227848-zue3screenshotinventorywiiutemplate.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2227848" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.56171875" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2227848-zue3screenshotinventorywiiutemplate.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2227848"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/135472/2227848-zue3screenshotinventorywiiutemplate.jpg"></a><figcaption>The inventory screen.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The <a href="/off-tv-play/3015-7482/" data-ref-id="3015-7482">Wii U GamePad</a> with its touch screen is going to function as the player's "Bug-Out-Bag" as it contains all of the player's survival tools like weapons, med kits and a map. Players have only one life and lose all the equipment and skills they've built up in their previous run, effectively combining elements of <a href="/rogue/3030-22309/" data-ref-id="3030-22309">Rogue</a>, <a href="/the-binding-of-isaac/3030-35899/" data-ref-id="3030-35899">The Binding of Isaac</a> and <a href="/dayz/3030-39256/" data-ref-id="3030-39256">DayZ</a>, the <a href="/arma-ii/3030-21528/" data-ref-id="3030-21528">ArmA II</a> mod. Once the player's character dies, they will wake up as another survivor of the ongoing zombie apocalypse and can kill the their previous character that now roams the area as a zombie to reclaim their items. Collecting weapons and items is essential to survive since a zombie horde can appear at any time and the player needs to find shelter that can be defended.</p><p style="">The main goal of the game is to survive as long as possible and eventually escape Zombie-infested London. Character progression is a key element and the longer a player survives, the more skilled the character becomes at handling weapons: accuracy, kickback, reload-times are among the upgradeable skills--all these benefits will have to be relearned if the character dies and players start back at the camp with a fresh survivor. Upgraded weapons and items can only be retrieved by killing the previous survivor who now roams the area in zombie-form.</p><p style="">The world state is permanent. Zombies that have been "killed" will not return. While some moments are <a href="/scripted-events/3015-2039/" data-ref-id="3015-2039">scripted</a>, enemy spawns are also dynamic to avoid predictable "<a href="/jump-scare-moment/3015-2882/" data-ref-id="3015-2882">jump-scare</a>" scripting.</p><p style="">Players progress through the world by fulfilling tasks give to them by one of the four main characters (in the form of radio voices). Looking for important items, turning a power generator back on or finding new supplies is what drives the randomly generated character into the streets of London via the sewer system which acts as a kind of <a href="/fast-travel/3015-676/" data-ref-id="3015-676">fast-travel</a> from the main hub in the safe house. The game world is not wide open but will be re-populated with enemies and items as time goes by since backtracking and completing objectives in previously visited areas is a big part of the game.</p><p style="">From time to time, the safe house will get attacked by zombies where the player will have to fend off the hordes and use the items found previously to defend themselves, or to barricade the entry ways.</p><h4>Online Features in Single Player</h4><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2324699-zombiumessagecreating.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2324699" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.56225528582616" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2324699-zombiumessagecreating.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2324699"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2324699-zombiumessagecreating.jpg"></a><figcaption>Bomb the walls!</figcaption></figure><p style="">In a way reminiscent of the system first found in <a href="/demons-souls/3030-24057/" data-ref-id="3030-24057">Demon's Souls</a>, ZombiU incorporates a system called "Blacklight" which lets players leave messages via graffiti in the game world which can be scanned and read by other players. These messages are comprised of symbols instead of written text and can be tagged as distrustworthy.</p><p style="">There is also an always-online feature called "Mercy Kill" that, once a player dies, notifies their friends of the player's death and other players can then look for their friend's now zombified body to end its misery and steal their loot in the process.</p><p style=""><b>Survival Mode</b></p><p style="">Once players finish the game, a new option becomes available that lets players play in Survival Mode.

The Zombie King has a limited pool of points to spend on zombie units. Basic grunts cost one point, but armored hunter units cost four. Resource management is key in this case. During the course of a match, both players can also level up and gain skills/zombie types to select.</p><p style="">The multiplayer portion of the game is comprised of three modes:</p><h4>Assault Mode</h4><p style="">Assault Mode was revealed along with the game at <a href="/e3-2012/3015-7024/" data-ref-id="3015-7024">E3 2012</a>. It is a blend of <a href="/control-point/3015-187/" data-ref-id="3015-187">Control Point Capture</a> and <a href="/capture-the-flag/3015-25/" data-ref-id="3015-25">Capture the Flag</a> modes form other games. The GamePad-player (or the Zombie King) and the First Person-player (Survivor) both compete to capture three flags spread across a map. The Zombie King controls the spawn points for the zombies but has to split his attention between attacking the Survivor while also having zombies go for the flag points. The Survivor has to focus on surviving while capturing the flag posts.</p><h4>Killing Box</h4><p style="">In Killing Box, the Survivor has to hold out against the zombie hordes dropped onto the map by the Zombie King. This mode is high score-based and scores the player for how many zombies he can kill before the Zombie King eventually takes them out.</p><h4>Survival Mode</h4><p style="">Survival Mode rank players depending on how long they hold out against the Zombie King's horde.</p><p style="">Multiplayer supports local play only, due to the focus on <a href="/asymmetric-gameplay/3015-7566/" data-ref-id="3015-7566">asymmetric gameplay</a>.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style="">ZombiU is set in a modern-but-zombie-infested London, England. The apocalyptic prophecies of mathematician, astronomer and adviser to Queen Elizabeth I, John Dee, serve as the basis for the game.</p><p style="">Players get thrown into the world as random, non-specific (silent) survivors who only get described with basic characteristics like their name, age and profession. The survivors get guidance from the Prepper (a survival expert who was prepared for the outbreak), Sandra (leader of the secret society named “The Ravens of Dee”) and Dr. Walker who is trying to find a cure for the zombie virus. These characters will talk to the player via the GamePad and give instructions, provide mission objectives and serve as the main driving force behind the game's narrative. Depending on who players choose to primarily align themselves with, the outcome of the story may differ ultimately as their goals range from curing everybody or simply escaping.</p><h2>Killer Freaks from Outer Space - Dev History</h2><h4>History</h4><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1807710-key2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1807710" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.56266666666667" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1807710-key2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1807710"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5911/1807710-key2.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5911/1807710-key2.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">ZombiU was originally unveiled as a Wii U exclusive first person shooter named Killer Freaks from Outer Space at E3 2011. Even before that, the game started as a multiplatform project that featured regular, non-alien <a href="/rabbids/3015-4945/" data-ref-id="3015-4945">Rabbids</a> and was called Attack of the Killer Rabbids From Outer Space because the developers at Ubisoft Montpellier had been working on Rabbids games for years and grew tired of them so they wanted to make a game about shooting them in the face. The game dropped off the map until the following year, when Ubisoft re-revealed it in its current format during their E3 2012 Press Conference. After they premiered the ZombiU trailer, it was explained that the developers retooled the game from a first person shooter with unique Rabbid/<a href="/gremlins/3015-3313/" data-ref-id="3015-3313">Gremlin</a>-hybrid looking aliens into a more realistic survival-horror game with Zombies.</p><h4>Original Design</h4><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1807846-rz69e.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1807846" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.50666666666667" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:50.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1807846-rz69e.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1807846"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5911/1807846-rz69e.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5911/1807846-rz69e.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">During a developer roundtable at E3 2011, Nintendo and Ubisoft showed off the Killer Freaks version of the game in alpha stage. What they showed was very basic and featured just a short alley section where the player shot some alien Rabbids. The player controlled the game with a Wii U GamePad by using the gyro sensor in the controller and looking at the touch screen to aim and move, disregarding the TV almost completely. They also showed a multiplayer mode in which one player controlled the game with a Classic Controller Pro connected to a Wii Remote in standard FPS-mode and the second player used the Wii U GamePad to manage enemy spawn locations, a design foundation that was actually kept for ZombiU's final multiplayer mode.</p><h4>Original Story</h4><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1807709-key1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1807709" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.54533333333333" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:54.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1807709-key1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1807709"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5911/1807709-key1.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5911/1807709-key1.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">The story centers around an alien invasion.

Originally released in January 2015 under the title "Raven's Cry", the game received universally negative reviews for its poor controls, badly implemented audio (certain lines, seemingly at random, simply have no voiceover, and are displayed solely through subtitles) and bizarre writing. On November 20th, 2015, after numerous patches, developer <a href="/reality-pump-studios/3010-9584/" data-ref-id="3010-9584">Reality Pump Studios</a> took the game down from <a href="/steam/3015-718/" data-ref-id="3015-718">Steam</a>, and then put out a new version of the same game under the new Vendetta title, as if it were a brand new release, in order to distance the game from its past poor reputation. Although the game has been updated since its final version as Raven's Cry, this is again at the level of a common patch, and includes animation fixes and newly-dubbed voiceover so that no lines of dialogue in the game should come out silently. However the main issues, such as the controls and the general bugginess, supposedly remain.</p><p style=""> </p><p style=""> </p><h2>System Requirements</h2><h3>PC</h3><table

data-ref-id="3030-15065">Dark Messiah of Might &amp; Magic</a>, is a stealth action game set in the steampunk city of <a href="/dunwall/3035-3813/" data-ref-id="3035-3813">Dunwall</a>. You play as <a href="/corvo-attano/3005-23124/" data-ref-id="3005-23124">Corvo Attano</a>, the Lord Protector of the Empress of Dunwall. Her murder triggers a quest for revenge in which the player is tasked with assassinating various targets. The game presents a wide array of options for completing each mission while maintaining a challenge through unpredictable enemy behavior.</p><p style="">Although revenge is the driving force behind the narrative of Dishonored, the game offers complete freedom in how the player wishes to tackle every major objective. In fact, you can complete the game without being detected and/or killing anyone.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/16/161989/2341918-dishonored5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2341918" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/16/161989/2341918-dishonored5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2341918"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/16/161989/2341918-dishonored5.jpg"></a><figcaption>There are multiple ways to approach each level.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Dishonored offers an experience that can be vastly different depending on how the player chooses to play it. They can be a ghost, never being seen or heard as they complete your objectives; the assassin, leaving a trail of dead bodies in their wake, or a combination thereof. These choices are applied to the main assassination targets, as well. There is always a non-lethal option for the main target in a mission, but it requires a lot of extra effort from the player. Players have both health and mana bars that are refilled through consumption of potions, but mana will regenerate to a point based on how quickly they are using their magic based skills.</p><p style="">The story of Dishonored progresses in a linear fashion, but every mission in the story is its own sandbox, open to exploration. The rooftops, sewers, and even the ocean are explorable. Each mission is filled with secret areas and pathways, and there are usually a few NPCs to find that offer side-missions.</p><h3>Chaos System</h3><p style="">Dishonored keeps track of the player's actions with a "Chaos" system. The more the player chooses to kill, the more rats and plague victims will be roaming the city. The Chaos system also affects the story of Dishonored, making it much darker in tone if the player has killed many people.</p><h3>Skills and abilities</h3><p style="">Corvo is granted some unique abilities by the Outsider that are unlocked through the exchange of Runes. Runes are scattered across the various maps and unlock different skills based on their choice of how to play the game. Skills have two tiers, with the second being more expensive than the first, so players can have a few powerful skills, or an array of weaker ones. Choice in skills is permanent, so decisions on what skills to use must be made carefully.</p><ul><li><b>Blink:</b> The most important skill in Corvo's arsenal, this allows the player to teleport short distances both horizontally and vertically, though there is a distance penalty for vertical blinking. Level 2 increases blink distance significantly.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Dark Vision:</b> This skill reveals the outlines of being through walls including their line of sight. Level 2 also shows security systems and valuable objects.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Possession:</b> Allows players to take control of living things in their immediate vicinity for a short time, enabling them to travel through small spaces or hide. Level 2 allows players to possess humans.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Bend Time:</b> Slows down time for a short period, useful in both stealth and combat situations. Level 2 allows the player to stop time completely for a shorter duration.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Devouring Swarm:</b> Summons a pack of rats to attack the nearest living thing or eat nearby corpses to prevent future detection. Level 2 is a larger, more vicious swarm of rats.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Windblast:</b> Summons of gust of wind that will knock over enemies, douse fires, shatter wood and glass, and deflect enemy projectiles. Level 2 is a stronger gust.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Shadow Kill:</b> Turns stealth killed enemies to dust to prevent future detection by their comrades. Level 2 allows all killed enemies to be turned to dust.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Blood Thirsty:</b> Allows blocks and kills to build adrenaline, which once maxed allows Corvo to provide a devastating attack. Level 2 speeds up the rate of adrenaline and makes for a double attack which can kill multiple enemies.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Agility</b>: Enables players to jump higher. Level 2 allows them to run faster.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Vitality:</b> Increases maximum health. Level 2 allows for some health regeneration.</li></ul><h3>Combat</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/49445/2283592-au9bp.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2283592" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/49445/2283592-au9bp.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2283592"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/49445/2283592-au9bp.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/49445/2283592-au9bp.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Corvo with pistol and sword.</figcaption></figure><p style="">In Dishonored the player is always dual wielding, holding the sword in the player character's right hand and an item or spell in their left. Kills can be done in a detected or stealth mode, allowing for different play styles. In detected combat players can block opponents attacks, which leaves them open for deadly slashes or stabs, or simply slash and use gadgets to reach victory. Stealth kills require the player to sneak up undetected behind their target which will allow them to use lethal or nonlethal takedowns. A lethal take down is quicker while players must choke their victim during a non-lethal takedown. Players can also perform jumping assassinations from high locations onto lower platforms without taking damage. Combat is a completely avoidable scenario throughout most of the game.</p><p style="">Enemies in Dishonored often use the same tools as the player. Common enemies carry nothing but a sword or a club, while higher ranking enemies carry a gun or a crossbow, as well as a melee weapon. There are also enemies that have access to magic, though they are very rarely seen.</p><h3>Stealth</h3><p style="">There are a number of options for playing stealthily. Pressing the crouch button will darken the edges of the screen, indicating that "Stealth Mode" is enabled. While Stealth Mode is enabled, the sounds of player movement are muffled, and hiding in the shadows will reduce a nearby NPC's sight range. There is a lean function which allows for peaking around corners without the possibility of being spotted. Keyholes on closed doors can be peeked through to scout out a room before proceeding. Loose objects can be picked up and thrown to create a noisy distraction. The short sword can also be used to create distractions by bashing it against solid objects.</p><h3>Weapons and Gadgets</h3><ul><li><b>Sword:</b> Used for melee and stealth combat, it is also used in blocking. The primary tool in Corvo's arsenal and thus is always equipped.</li><li><b>Pistol:</b> For ranged takedowns, very loud. Can be equipped with explosive ammo.</li><li><b>Crossbow:</b> Handheld crossbow is a silent, single shot killer. Can be loaded with incendiary and non-lethal sleep darts.</li><li><b>Grenades</b>: Thrown explosive useful for large groups of enemies. There is a sticky variation as well.</li><li><b>Springrazor:</b> Proximity mine that launches razors in the general vicinity, ripping targets to shreds. Can be attached to walls, doors, and creatures.</li><li><b>Heart:</b> Detects Bone-Charms and Runes in the area</li><li><b>Rewire tools:</b> Allow Corvo to rewire traps and security systems on his enemies.</li><li><b>Bone-Charms:</b> Magic charms that are slotted to provide passive bonuses.</li></ul><h3>Upgrades</h3><p style="">While in the hub area, Corvo can fully upgrade his equipment by talking to an inventor named Piero. There are several upgrades to choose from, including accuracy and damage of ranged weapons, or an increase to the amount of grenades that can be carried.

Having just returned from a trip overseas, the Empress, not long after being reunited with Corvo, is assassinated while <a href="/emily-kaldwin/3005-24580/" data-ref-id="3005-24580">Emily</a> is kidnapped, Corvo being framed for both. As a result he is imprisoned and sentenced to be executed. The mastermind of the plot, the shadowy Lord Regent, becomes the head of state in the Empress's absence.</p><p style="">An underground resistance movement seeks Corvo's aid, and there is much to be gained in return. Corvo must become the fist of vengeance for his fallen Empress and ensure the safety of Emily by assassinating or disabling allies of the Lord Regent, and eventually installing Emily as the new Empress before the Lord Regent gains complete control of the country.</p><p style="">The setting for this story is a steampunk universe; more specifically, the port city of Dunwall, separated from other nearby archipelagos by monster-infested waters. The main power source of the world is whale oil, a product that in the past had made Dunwall a wealthy trading hub. Political tensions run high, however, and due to a plague that has wiped out over half of the city, other countries refuse to help and eventually embargo the once powerful city. The plague is transmitted by rats who run rampant throughout the city, spreading the sickness to those that cannot afford the expensive elixirs that treat the malady. Much of the city is in ruins because of the plague, with victims wandering the derelict streets, while other parts are under martial law to prevent the spread. The population is oppressed by both financial and military constraints, hence many have turned to religion or black magic.</p><p style="">Corvo is a <a href="/stealth/3015-24/" data-ref-id="3015-24">stealth</a> professional and beside his natural talent and new-found supernatural powers, he also has the ability to bend time, and "<a href="/possession/3015-819/" data-ref-id="3015-819">possess</a>" living things, allowing players to take control and play as them for a short amount of time. Most important of these powers is the Blink spell, which allows the player to traverse the map both vertically and horizontally. These powers were granted to Corvo by a figure known only as <a href="/the-outsider/3005-24710/" data-ref-id="3005-24710">The Outsider</a>. This supernatural being is the source of all magic in the world. Its nature, origins, and intentions are all shrouded by mystery.</p><p style="">The story will change depending on the decisions players make: the more death that Corvo causes, the grimmer the final outlook of the game. Similar to the <a href="/deus-ex/3025-146/" data-ref-id="3025-146">Deus Ex franchise</a>, the game will require players to make tough choices without breaking the flow of gameplay, while giving the player a limited amount of time to do so.</p><h2>Downloadable Content (Single-Player Plot Add-On)</h2><figure data-align="right" data-size="medium" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7030/2454693-1375813628-disho.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2454693" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7030/2454693-1375813628-disho.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2454693"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7030/2454693-1375813628-disho.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7030/2454693-1375813628-disho.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">"The Knife of Dunwall" has players taking on the role of Daud, whose assassination of a key figure in Dunwall sets the core story of the game into motion.

A <a href="/wii-u/3045-139/" data-ref-id="3045-139">Wii U</a> port, developed by <a href="/panic-button/3010-7250/" data-ref-id="3010-7250">Panic Button</a>,was announced during GDC 2015. A Xbox One version is being developed in-house.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style=""><a href="//www.giantbomb.com/octodad/3005-17137/" data-ref-id="3005-17137">Octodad</a> is controlled by individually moving around his arms and legs (read: his tentacles). It's possible to grab and fling just about every object in the game. Almost all puzzles and tasks revolve solely around the mechanics of Octodad's movement.</p><p style="">While the player can cause all types of mayhem with Octodad's erratic movements and behavior, it's advised not to cause too much chaos when being watched by others as that will raise the Suspicion meter, leading to Octodad's true identity being discovered when full.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style="">Up until now, Octodad and his loving wife and kids have been simply enjoying life from him doing chores around the house to playing with his son and daughter, all the while his family being blissfully unaware of Octodad's secret of actually being an octopus (as shown in the first Octodad game). However as of late, his wife has become suspicious of Octodad's dubious behavior. Couple that with him constantly dealing with the Chef, Octodad's arch-nemesis and the only individual who is fully aware of the fact that he's an octopus, and a fateful family outing to the aquarium and it's only the beginning of Octodad's problems in Octodad: Dadliest Catch.</p><h2>System Requirements</h2><h3>PC</h3><h4>Minimum</h4><ul><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows XP

Curve Studios is bringing the game to PlayStation systems, Xbox One and Wii U later in 2015 alongside the Steam release from Size Five Games.</p><h2 style="margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;">Gameplay</h2><p style="">The game is about infiltrating various facilities to steal their money and escape with multiple ways to complete that task. Players can, for example, take the stealthy route and try to enter through a skylight on the roof, or tackle it head-on and hack the security cameras before blowing up a wall and going in guns blazing.</p><p style="">The Swindle uses a steampunk aesthetic, and in keeping with that theme, your character has a pair of steampunk gloves which can be upgraded with money  gathered throughout your missions. The upgrades range from faster hacking to double-jumps and telekinesis.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>35940</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/82063/2725642-logo.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82063/2725642-logo.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/82063/2725642-logo.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2725642-logo.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/82063/2725642-logo.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/82063/2725642-logo.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/82063/2725642-logo.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[The Swindle]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating/><original_release_date>2015-07-28 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-17/]]></api_detail_url><id>17</id><name><![CDATA[Mac]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/mac/3045-17/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[MAC]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-88/]]></api_detail_url><id>88</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation Network (PS3)]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-network-ps3/3045-88/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3N]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-139/]]></api_detail_url><id>139</id><name><![CDATA[Wii U]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/wii-u/3045-139/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[WIIU]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-143/]]></api_detail_url><id>143</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation Network (Vita)]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-network-vita/3045-143/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PSNV]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-145/]]></api_detail_url><id>145</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox One]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-one/3045-145/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[XONE]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/]]></api_detail_url><id>146</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 4]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS4]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/the-swindle/3030-35940/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[Tiger

It marks Bungie's first foray away from the <a href="/halo/3025-2/" data-ref-id="3025-2">Halo</a> series since its creation (and its first game for Sony consoles since <a href="/oni/3030-17168/" data-ref-id="3030-17168">Oni</a>).</p><p style="">Set over 700 years into the future (after a period of technological advancement known as the Golden Age, thanks to a mysterious orb known as "The Traveler"), a mysterious event (known as "the Collapse") has decimated human colonies throughout the galaxy. With the last surviving human city on <a href="/earth/3035-65/" data-ref-id="3035-65">Earth</a> defended by The Guardians (warriors who have unique abilities granted by The Traveler), players take control of a customizable Guardian, who must investigate the solar system and destroy a variety of alien threats before humanity is wiped out.</p><p style="">The game includes a variety of <a href="/role-playing-shooter/3015-3938/" data-ref-id="3015-3938">RPG</a> elements, as players level up their Guardian and maintain an inventory gained by acquiring loot (by killing enemies, completing tasks, and buying from vendors). Along with a standard free-roaming mode (known as Patrol) and a campaign, players can team up for quick three-man co-operative missions (known as Strike) or a very long six-man co-operative mission (known as <a href="/raid/3015-247/" data-ref-id="3015-247">Raid</a>). Players can also team up against other players in the Crucible mode.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/99864/2488057-4745087959-Desti.png" data-ref-id="1300-2488057" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.5425" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:54.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/99864/2488057-4745087959-Desti.png" data-ref-id="1300-2488057"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/9/99864/2488057-4745087959-Desti.png"></a><figcaption>A fireteam of three players out in the world</figcaption></figure><p style="">Unlike Bungie's past work, Destiny is built around custom characters. The game has a class-based system, and three classes--Hunter, Titan, and Warlock. In addition to firing rifles, pistols, rocket launchers, and sniper rifles, players will also have access to magic-like abilities, granted by the Traveler.</p><p style="">Three weapons can be equipped at a time, and more can be carried in the inventory. The three slots are called "primary", "special", and "heavy". Every player also has a small speeder bike vehicle currently called the Sparrow and can be used to traverse larger areas. Characters will also have access to their own customizable spaceship, but it will not be player controlled nor will there be space combat. It's more of a means to fast travel. Glimmer, small blue bits that drop from killed enemies, is a currency needed to buy new weapons, pieces of armor, vehicles, and other cosmetic items as well as upgrade some weapons and armor.</p><p style="">As an online-only game, Destiny will feature separate, third-person social spaces where players can collect, group up, and prepare for the missions ahead. Some mission zones will also be public spaces, allowing for players to encounter each other while out in the field and group up on-the-fly. Bungie has stated that the goal is to not show lobbies, matchmaking, or connection screens, instead delivering a more seamless experience. Player-versus-player combat will not be a factor out in the general world, but instead the game features The Crucible, a special location that is traveled to by players in order to participate in PVP gametypes. Player counts for public spaces are not known at this time and will likely vary depending on the platform and network connection of the player.</p><h3>Loot</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/458/2499197-vlcsnap-2013-04-14-22h17m39s26.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2499197" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/458/2499197-vlcsnap-2013-04-14-22h17m39s26.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2499197"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/458/2499197-vlcsnap-2013-04-14-22h17m39s26.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/458/2499197-vlcsnap-2013-04-14-22h17m39s26.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Exotic Hunter cloaks</figcaption></figure><p style="">Destiny is a loot driven game. Weapons, armor, and wearable items can be found in the world when players are on a mission or just exploring, bought from various vendors at The Tower, gained as rewards for completing challenges, or randomly received for competing in The Crucible. When loot is collected from a killed enemy only one player needs to run over the glowing orb representing the loot and it will automatically be distributed among the group if the player isn't alone. All armor and clothing items will have properties that effect gameplay. Exotic gear is the name Bungie has given to rare items within the world of Destiny. These items will have a unique look to them and special names.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style="">Some time ago, there was once a Golden Age of human spacefaring. A mysterious orb called The Traveler made its way to Earth, jumpstarting human technology and allowing them to colonize the worlds of the Solar System. But humanity was eventually pushed back by some unknown force, only surviving by the intervention and "sacrifice" of The Traveler, below which now sits humankind's last remaining settlement, a lone city.</p><p style="">Now, in the present time, humans have managed to recover their technology to the point of being able to travel into space again, but they discover that their former colonies have now become occupied by several alien races, who are pushing towards conquering the last human city. Warriors known as Guardians are tasked with protecting the city and fighting against the aliens to order to restore humanity to its former glory.</p><p style="">Ghost, voiced by Game of Thrones star Peter Dinklage, is a customizable AI companion issued to every Guardian in The City. It/He assists the player in different ways, like unlocking doors, turning on a building's lights, or warning of incoming enemies.</p><h2>The Tower</h2><p style="">A selectable destination by players, the Tower is the home of the guardians. It's here players are able to buy new gear and loot, take on Bounties, and socialize with other players.</p><h3>Vanguards</h3><p style="">The Vanguards are the advisers of each class. From them you can purchase class specific gear and emblems. The higher your Vanguard reputation, the better the gear will be available.

All classes can use "space magic", and all classes can use all weapon types. A class is described by Bungie as a choice to "fine tune" your Guardian so that there will be little regret in a player's choice. Each class is customized within two subclasses, able to be changed on the fly. Once locked in a duplicate subclass will unlock, to encourage experimentation. Further players are able to have multiple characters.</p><h3>Hunter</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/99864/2488049-5078643701-Hunte.png" data-ref-id="1300-2488049" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="1.632183908046" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:163.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/99864/2488049-5078643701-Hunte.png" data-ref-id="1300-2488049"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/9/99864/2488049-5078643701-Hunte.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/9/99864/2488049-5078643701-Hunte.png"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">A combination of speed and strength, their signature weapons appear to be sniper rifles and revolvers.

The player will need to buy or rent weapons or gun parts. The currency system is more closely like Tribes Ascend. There are 2 types of currency (as there is in Tribes Ascend) GP which is what a player gets when they get kills in a match or capturing an object, the other is ZEN (Perfect World Entertainment's) money bought currency, which enables a player to spend actual money to buy/rent Guns or gun parts without spending GP. Players can also purchase equipment during a match using one of several weapon depots located around the map. Players will need to acquire sufficient enough CP (by killing, assisting, or capturing points) before they are able to buy anything from the Weapon Depot. Some of the things a player can purchase is Replenish Heath, Refill Ammo, or the player can buy heavy weapons: Rocket Launcher, Flamethrower (and ammo for those weapons), or the Deadly Hardsuit.</p><p style="">New to the series, the <a data-ref-id="3055-21" href="/mech/3055-21/">mech</a>-like Hardsuit can be purchased at weapon depots and airdropped onto a player-specified outdoor location. The Hardsuit is equipped with both a <a data-ref-id="3055-25" href="/railgun/3055-25/">railgun</a> and a <a data-ref-id="3055-288" href="/gatling-gun/3055-288/">minigun</a>, which can be fired simultaneously. Hardsuits are very powerful and difficult to take down, but if a player uses the HRV (Hyper Reality Visor) then a weak point on the Hardsuit can be found and fired at to deal severe damage. Also another Strategy is for the player to use a Flamethrower which kills the operator of the Hardsuit but leaves the suit intact.</p><h2>HRV (Hyper Reality Visor)</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64483/2255297-blacklight_retirbution_hrv.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2255297" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64483/2255297-blacklight_retirbution_hrv.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2255297"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/64483/2255297-blacklight_retirbution_hrv.jpg"></a><figcaption>HRV being used by a player.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The Hyper Reality Visor enables the player to be able to see through walls allowing the player to be able to see all adversary's, allies, weapon depots and even find weak points in a Hardsuit, mines show up as a attention marker. Grenades that are throw by a player cannot not be seen by the HRV.</p><p style="">The player is unable to use a weapon while HRV is in use, and HRV can't be used infinitely it will need to recharge, then the player can use it again. The player can also see the health of a adversary by looking directly at them.</p><h2>Game Modes</h2><p style="">Blacklight: Retribution currently features eight modes of play: <a data-ref-id="3015-451" href="/deathmatch/3015-451/">Deathmatch</a>, <a data-ref-id="3015-2463" href="/team-deathmatch/3015-2463/">Team Deathmatch</a>, <a data-ref-id="3015-25" href="/capture-the-flag/3015-25/">Capture the Flag</a>, Kill Confirmed, <a data-ref-id="3015-1292" href="/king-of-the-hill/3015-1292/">King of the Hill</a>, Domination, Netwar, and Siege.</p><h3><b>(Team) Deathmatch</b></h3><p style="">The rules of Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch in Blacklight are your standard fare. In Deathmatch, players battle one another until one player reaches a kill limit or the timer runs out. Team deathmatch plays by the same rules, but the players are split up into two teams.</p><h3><b>Capture the Flag</b></h3><p style="">In CTF, players are split into two teams and are charged with the task of stealing the opposing team's flag as well as protecting their own flag. CTF in Blacklight is standard, dual-flag CTF.</p><h3><b>Kill Confirmed</b></h3><p style="">Kill Confirmed is similar to the <a data-ref-id="3025-82" href="/call-of-duty/3025-82/">Call of Duty</a> game mode of the same name. The rules are identical to team deathmatch, except that kills are only counted if a token dropped by a dead player is retrieved by any member of the opposing team. If that token is picked up by the dead player's ally, the enemy team is "denied" the kill.</p><h3><b>King of the Hill</b></h3><p style="">King of the Hill in Blacklight is, again, your standard fare. Two teams battle to control a small, circular area of the map until it expires and a new "hill" is generated elsewhere on the map. The team that reaches the point goal first, or who has controlled the various hills for the longest total time at the end of the match, win.</p><h3><b>Domination</b></h3><p style="">Domination has similarities with <a data-ref-id="3025-51" href="/battlefield/3025-51/">Battlefield</a>'s Conquest mode. There are a number of fixed stations on the map over which two teams battle for control. Controlling a station generates points for your team, and owning the majority of stations on the map results in your team gaining score faster than the other team. The team that reaches the point limit first or has the most points when time expires will win.</p><p style="">One difference between Blacklight's Domination and Battlefield's Conquest is that in Blacklight, players can hack stations to give their team control of that station immediately. Stations are hacked by playing a hacking <a data-ref-id="3015-116" href="/minigames/3015-116/">mini-game</a> where the player is shown three numbers; The center number must be matched with the number to it's left or right, and the player has a limited amount of time to pick the correct number. After completing this number-matching puzzle four times, the station is hacked. The player lowers their gun while hacking, making them extremely vulnerable to attack.</p><h3><b>Netwar</b></h3><p style="">Netwar is a hybrid of Domination and CTF. There is one "flag" on the map that both teams must fight over, however, the flag is not ran to a team's home base. Instead, there are stations positioned throughout the map that the player can take the flag to, so long as the station is controlled by their team. Teams must defend and obtain both stations and the flag simultaneously, making for quite a hectic game mode. Unlike CTF, players can sprint while holding the flag.</p><h3><b>Siege</b></h3><p style="">The newest mode added to Blacklight, Siege is a type of "attack and defend" mode that is similar to the <a data-ref-id="3015-224" href="/payload/3015-224/">Payload</a> mode in <a data-ref-id="3030-18162" href="/team-fortress-2/3030-18162/">Team Fortress 2</a>. One team is charged with escorting a walking tank towards the enemy team's base, repairing the vehicle when needed and hacking any obstructing gates along the way. The defending team must halt the tank's progress by keeping players away from the tank or by keeping their gates erected until time runs out. The defending team can also destroy the tank entirely, which will result in an immediate loss for the attacking team.</p><h2>System Requirements</h2><h3><strong>Minimum</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows® XP / Vista / Windows 7 (32-bit)</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Dual-Core CPU</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2 GB RAM</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> 256MB DX9 GPU (Geforce 8xxx or Radeon HD2xxx)</li><li><strong>DirectX®:</strong> 9.0c</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong> 8 GB HD space</li><li><strong>Sound:</strong> DirectX 9.0c compatible sound card</li><li><strong>Other Requirements:</strong> Broadband Internet connection</li></ul><h3><strong>Recommended</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 7 (64-bit)</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Quad-Core CPU</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> 1GB+ DX11 GPU</li><li><strong>DirectX®:</strong> 9.0c</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong> 8 GB HD space</li><li><strong>Sound:</strong> DirectX 9.0c compatible sound card</li><li><strong>Other Requirements:</strong> Broadband Internet connection</li></ul>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>36230</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/2578159-box_blr.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/2578159-box_blr.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/2578159-box_blr.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/2578159-box_blr.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/2578159-box_blr.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2578159-box_blr.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/2578159-box_blr.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Blacklight Retribution]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>-1</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating/><original_release_date>2012-07-02 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/]]></api_detail_url><id>146</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 4]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS4]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/blacklight-retribution/3030-36230/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[AirMech Arena]]></aliases><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-36296/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2011-09-02 14:20:25</date_added><date_last_updated>2015-05-11 21:49:21</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[AirMech is a real-time strategy game that puts players in the world as a robot that can turn into a jet.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">AirMech is a <a href="/free-to-play/3015-1308/" data-ref-id="3015-1308">free-to-play</a> real-time strategy action game from Carbon Games, heavily inspired by the <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/genesis/3045-6/" data-ref-id="3045-6">Genesis</a> classic <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/herzog-zwei/3030-11439/" data-ref-id="3030-11439">Herzog Zwei</a>. It debuted as a multiplatform app in Google's Chrome App Store in April 2012. It was later made available for Steam, first through inclusion in two <a href="/indie-royale/3015-7236/" data-ref-id="3015-7236">Indie Royale</a> bundles in May and June of 2012. Then beta access became available to purchasers of the <em>AirMech Beta Bundle</em> through Steam. As Steam's Early Access program was launched, Airmech became part of that program, the game is currently available for free with microtransactions, and an optional <em>AirMech Prime</em> purchase that'll unlock all the units in the game.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">In the game, players have direct control over a flying craft that can turn into a robot. When in jet form, units (such as tanks, bikes, soldiers, and so on) can be picked up and flown around the battlefield. Soldier units appear as <a href="/multiplayer-online-battle-arena/3015-6598/" data-ref-id="3015-6598">MOBA</a>-style creeps out of the players main base and make a beeline for the nearest neutral or enemy-controlled facility. Taking over other buildings on the battlefield (by having the soldiers enter the stations) gives you a forward spawn point for units as well as a place to heal your robojet. The end goal in the main mode is to push your enemies off the map by taking over their main position.</p><p style="">Some items can be purchased with in-game currency (known as "kudos") or diamonds, which are acquired via microtransaction purchases. Customizable options include additional units, bonuses that help you earn kudos or experience points more quickly, cosmetic skins for your main unit, and pilots that confer various postive and negative traits, such as faster build speeds or slowly movement. Some items are deliberately overpowered and can only be used when playing against AI opposition.</p><h3>Loadouts</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33727/2174762-units.png" data-ref-id="1300-2174762" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.56413301662708" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33727/2174762-units.png" data-ref-id="1300-2174762"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33727/2174762-units.png"></a><figcaption>Loadout Screen</figcaption></figure><p style="">Before beginning a game players must select an AirMech, a Pilot, an Item, and eight units to bring with them into the match. These eight units are the only units the player will be able to produce for that round. Eight basic units are provided by default, with many more available to purchase with either kudos, diamonds, or for a one-time fee (on the order of 2 dollars).</p><p style="">More units are expected to be added to the game as it grows, though all will have trade-offs to maintain balance. The idea is that gaining access to new units gives you different units than other players, not necessarily better units. For instance, a more powerful version of the stock Longhorn tank, the Gemini, has better stats all around but costs more money in-game and takes longer to build.</p><h3>Quests</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33727/2174760-quests.png" data-ref-id="1300-2174760" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.56127886323268" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33727/2174760-quests.png" data-ref-id="1300-2174760"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33727/2174760-quests.png"></a><figcaption>Quests</figcaption></figure><p style="">A number of quests are available, and their progress is kept automatically. These include killing a certain number of units in one match or being on the winning side of an online match. These quests must be redeemed by going to the quests page as you finish each one.</p><h3>Game Modes</h3><p style="">There are several modes, most of which allow up to 3 players on a team (for up to 6 human players in an online PvP match).</p><h4>PvP</h4><p style="">This mode pits human players against each other in teams of 1, 2, or 3 on any of the maps. The goal of this mode is to destroy the other team's fortress while defending your own. Outposts, creeps, and manually built units are all found in this mode. This is how most matches are structured.</p><p style="">If a player drops out mid-game, the AI takes control of their AirMech. Both kudos and experience can be gained by both the winners and losers.</p><h4>COOP</h4><p style="">This mode is similar to PvP, except that all human players play on one team, and AI opponents populate the other team. Again, kudos and experience can be gained in this mode.</p><h4>Solo</h4><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33727/2174759-game11.png" data-ref-id="1300-2174759" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.56346381969158" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33727/2174759-game11.png" data-ref-id="1300-2174759"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33727/2174759-game11.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33727/2174759-game11.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Victory!</figcaption></figure><p style="">A solo match is an offline mode that pits the player with up to two AI teammates against up to three AI opponents. The teams do not necessarily have to be even in this mode. The rest of the match plays out the same as the PvP mode.</p><p style="">Kudos and experience can only be gained in this mode for the first 90 minutes of play each day. After 90 minutes of in-game time (spent actually playing a match) the player will no longer gain experience or kudos. Note that online matches such as PvP award kudos and experience for an indefinite amount of game time.</p><h4>Survival</h4><p style="">In this mode, the player is placed on a custom Survival map with a fortress at the center and some outposts. Creeps will begin to spawn at the edges of the maps and attempt to destroy the fortress in larger and larger waves. The player's goal is to hold out as long as possible, earning more kudos and experience the longer they last. The creeps here different from the creeps in the other modes. In normal matches, creeps consist only of soldier units, and all other units have to be built and given orders by the player. Here, the creeps run the full gamut of available units.</p><p style="">Like Solo play, kudos and experience can only be gained in this mode for the first 90 minutes of play each day.</p><h4>Challenge</h4><p style="">In this final mode, hand-designed challenges await the player and his or her companions. These are described as being more like puzzles than tests of brute skill with your AirMech.</p><h2>Microtransactions</h2><p style="">AirMech follows a free-to-play model. It can be found for free on the Chrome App store currently with a default set of units enabled. There are three types of currency that can be used to unlock new units, pilots, AirMechs, and items. In addition these all require the player to reach a certain level by gaining experience, which can only be obtained by playing the game.</p><h3>Kudos</h3><p style="">Kudos are earned in-game based on whether your team won or not, how long the match lasted, what mode you were playing, etc. These can be accumulated indefinitely (assuming you are playing online, see above) and exchanged for the lion's share of the units, pilots, items and mechs availabe. A few things cannot be purchased with kudos. They include custom skins and enhanced version of units whose base version is available for purchase with kudos.</p><p style="">Note that as of this writing individual PvP games net around 100-300 kudos and take about 15-20 minutes to play. Most things go for almost 3,000 kudos, so this is a fairly grind-intensive way to unlock new units.</p><h3>Diamonds</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33727/2174748-diamonds.png" data-ref-id="1300-2174748" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.96937573616019" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:96.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33727/2174748-diamonds.png" data-ref-id="1300-2174748"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33727/2174748-diamonds.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33727/2174748-diamonds.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Diamond store</figcaption></figure><p style="">Diamonds are purchased with cash and can be redeemed for units, AirMechs, pilots, items or even boosts in the amount of experience or kudos gained each round. They can be purchased in a variety of amounts and follow the familiar model for such in-game currencies.</p><p style="">Buying diamonds grants you VIP status for a set period of time. This VIP status increases the amount of kudos you gain by 5%.</p><h3>Cash</h3><p style="">After receiving feedback from the community, the developers admitted they only implemented the diamonds system because that was how every other free-to-play model out there did it. They then acquiesced to the fans and added a direct "purchase with cash" option for things that would otherwise only have a diamonds or kudos option. These payments are made individually, so diamonds remain as a way to have a set of funds in-game with which to purchase multiple things without having to navigate multiple transactions. Diamonds also offer discounts when bought in bulk.</p><h2 style="margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;">Soundtrack</h2><p style="">Airmech's soundtrack was composed by the influential EBM band Front Line Assembly. The music was released separately on CD and as download, and included an promotional code for unlocking the band members as playable characters and a new skin for the <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/a10/3055-4099/" data-ref-id="3055-4099">A-10 Warthog</a> mech.</p><h2>PC System Requirements</h2><p style=""><strong>Minimum:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>OS:</strong>Windows XP</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong>Pentium 4</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong>2 GB RAM</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong>8800 GT</li><li><strong>DirectX®:</strong>9.0c</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong>100 MB HD space</li><li><strong>Sound:</strong>Yes</li><li><strong>Other Requirements:</strong>Broadband Internet connection</li><li><strong>Additional:</strong>System specs are temporary, gathering more data.</li></ul><p style=""><strong>Recommended:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>OS:</strong>Windows 7</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong>Core 2 Duo</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong>4 GB RAM</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong>8800 GT</li><li><strong>DirectX®:</strong>9.0c</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong>200 MB HD space</li><li><strong>Sound:</strong>Yes</li><li><strong>Other Requirements:</strong>Broadband Internet connection</li><li><strong>Additional:</strong>System specs are temporary, gathering more data.</li></ul>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>36296</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/0/1992/1878571-airmech.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1992/1878571-airmech.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/0/1992/1878571-airmech.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/1878571-airmech.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/1992/1878571-airmech.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1992/1878571-airmech.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/0/1992/1878571-airmech.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[AirMech]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-29/]]></api_detail_url><id>29</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: E10+]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2012-11-08 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-86/]]></api_detail_url><id>86</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360 Games Store]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360-games-store/3045-86/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[XBGS]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-140/]]></api_detail_url><id>140</id><name><![CDATA[Browser]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/browser/3045-140/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[BROW]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-145/]]></api_detail_url><id>145</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox One]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-one/3045-145/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[XONE]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/]]></api_detail_url><id>146</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 4]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS4]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/airmech/3030-36296/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-36494/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2011-09-23 11:17:57</date_added><date_last_updated>2015-08-27 02:35:23</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[Players create their own rockets from a variety of parts and then attempt to launch them into space.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Kerbal Space Program is a game developed by <a href="/squad/3010-7945/" data-ref-id="3010-7945">Squad</a> where players are given the ability to build and test rockets, exploration vehicles, and space planes of their own design. The first public release of the game, version 0.7.3, was first released on June 24, 2011. The game entered <a href="/steam/3015-718/" data-ref-id="3015-718">Steam's </a>early access program on March 20, 2013. The full version of the game was released on April 27, 2015 for <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">Windows</a>, <a href="/mac/3045-17/" data-ref-id="3045-17">Mac</a>, and <a href="/linux/3045-152/" data-ref-id="3045-152">Linux</a>.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">There are currently two modes available: Career and Sandbox.</p><h3>Career</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5400/1913998-construction.png" data-ref-id="1300-1913998" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.62019758507135" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5400/1913998-construction.png" data-ref-id="1300-1913998"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5400/1913998-construction.png"></a><figcaption>An example of a rocket being built. </figcaption></figure><p style="">The player begins with a very limited selection of parts (no wings, large engines etc). Additional parts are unlocked spending "Science" to progress along the technology tree. Science is generated by conducting experiments with experiment parts. Kerbals can also gather science by recording crew and EVA reports or by collecting surface samples. Science must either be beamed back via communication equipment or recovered from vessels that have landed back on Kerbin. Science is available in finite amounts on each planet or moon meaning that there is always a reason to explore. As of version 0.90 all planets and moons have multiple environments (biomes) that generate Science when experimented on. Certain experiment containers can only collect Science from one biome at a time, but can be 'cleaned' when docked with a mobile processing lab and then reused.</p><p style="">Players must also manage their space program's finances and reputation in career mode. Throughout the game there are contracts the players can carry out in order to gain reputation, money, and additional science points outside of performing experiments. The contracts can be as simple as flying to a certain altitude and testing a specific part, or can be more challenging and involve performing several tasks each having to meet some rigorous requirements. In career mode, all the parts to build rockets and spaceplanes have a cost. So, users are encouraged to complete contracts as efficiently as possible to maximize profits.</p><h3>Sandbox</h3><p style="">In Sandbox mode all the parts are unlocked from the beginning.</p><p style="">Gameplay consists of two separate phases. The first is the construction phase in which the player assembles the rocket from the available parts. These include fuel tanks, rocket engines, solid fuel boosters, parachutes, guidance systems and the command module itself. Designs can also include decouplers, which are parts that can be activated in flight to separate sections of the rocket which are not needed. For example, empty fuel tanks and boosters can be separated to reduce weight, which will help increase speed. Once a rocket is complete, the design can be saved and then taken to the second phase, the rocket flight.</p><p style="">The rocket's flight will begin on the launchpad. The player will have control over the rockets thrust and direction, as well as being able to activate guidance systems which can help keep the rocket on course. Many rocket designs will consist of several "stages," with each stage being activated with the press of a button. Only one stage can be active at a time, so the player will need to activate each stage when they feel the time is right. A simple example would be activating the first stage on the launchpad by firing the rockets engines. Once the engines are out of fuel, the player would activate the second stage to release them from the rocket. The player will also need to keep an eye on engine temperatures, as high temperatures will cause rockets to explode.</p><p style="">The rocket's flight takes place on and above the fictional planet of Kerbin. Atmosphere and gravity affect the rocket's control and speed depending on the distance from the planet, meaning the player will need to keep this in mind if they are attempting to orbit or land safely back on the planets surface. If the rocket is manned, the Kerbalnauts can be killed by explosions or impact with celestial bodies. If the player wants to attempt a safe landing they can attach parachutes to help slow the command modules, or even fire rockets to slow themselves down.</p><p style="">Players are now able to dock ships in the game, allowing the construction of space stations in orbit around Kerbin or any other celestial body in the game. There is also a flight planning mechanic that allows players to plan future maneuvers that can help players fly to other planets, or establish orbits.</p><p style="">There are currently seven planets in the full game: Moho, Eve, Kerbin, Duna, Dres, Jool, and Eeloo. Many of them have moons for a total of 15 bodies to explore.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/28218/2329104-system.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2329104" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.4" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:40.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/28218/2329104-system.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2329104"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/28218/2329104-system.jpg"></a></figure><p style=""><b>Moho</b>, the small rocky planet closest to the sun has an inclined and slightly eccentric orbit.

There are four unique moons: <b>Laythe</b>, <b>Vall</b>, <b>Pol,</b> and <b>Tylo</b> as well as a captured asteroid called <b>Bop</b> to explore. Jool's immense gravity and long distance from Kerbin make it the most difficult planet to explore and return safely.</p><p style=""><strong>Eeloo</strong> is a dwarf planet and is the farthest planet away from the sun most of the time. Eeloo's orbit intersects Jool's orbital path making Jool the farthest planet from the sun depending on the time.</p><h2>Collaboration with NASA</h2><p style="">Kerbal Space Program: Asteroid Redirect Mission was released on April 1st 2014 in an update which was developed by Squad in collaboration with <a href="/national-aeronautics-and-space-administration/3010-6976/" data-ref-id="3010-6976">NASA</a>. It mirrors NASA's ongoing Asteroid Redirect Mission allowing players to: Identify potential asteroid targets for investigation, redirect the orbit of asteroids and to explore them with crewed missions. The aim of the mission pack is to raise the profile of NASA and it's technology development initiatives and deep space exploration programs.

Toki Tori 2 employs an open development model, allowing players access to early versions of the game from Day 1 of development.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Toki Tori 2 is an <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/open-world/3015-207/" data-ref-id="3015-207">open-world</a> <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/puzzle/3030-1801/" data-ref-id="3030-1801">puzzle</a> game from <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/two-tribes-bv/3010-2372/" data-ref-id="3010-2372">Two Tribes</a>. The game was released on <a href="/wii-u/3045-139/" data-ref-id="3045-139">Wii U</a> on April 4, 2013. An updated version with new features was also released on <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC</a> and <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/mac/3045-17/" data-ref-id="3045-17">Mac</a> as "Toki Tori 2+" via <a href="/steam/3015-718/" data-ref-id="3015-718">Steam</a> on July 11, 2013. Toki Tori 2+ was made available for Wii U owners of the game in September that same year as a free update along with replacing the existing Toki Tori 2 on the eShop as the main version.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">In the original <a href="/toki-tori/3030-3244/" data-ref-id="3030-3244">Toki Tori</a>, players could use weapons and items whereas in Toki Tori 2, all of this has been taken away in favor of focusing entirely on chirping and stomping. The former is used to attract animals within a set radius. They will come toward <a href="/toki-tori/3005-6905/" data-ref-id="3005-6905">Toki Tori</a> and thus function as puzzle elements. The player can learn various songs (consisting of long and short chirps) that yield different results. Stomping takes care of the opposite need, getting animals away from Toki Tori. When dealing with stationary wild life, stomping might cause it to react in other ways.</p><h2>System Requirements</h2><h3>PC</h3><h4>Minimum</h4><ul><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 7</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core 2 Duo or comparable</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2 GB RAM</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Geforce 8000 series (discrete) or Intel HD 3000 (integrated) GPU</li><li><strong>DirectX®:</strong> 9.0c</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong> 1 GB HD space</li><li><strong>Controller:</strong> Gamepad support</li></ul><h4>Recommended</h4><ul><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 7</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel i5 or comparable</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Geforce 9800 GT or better with 1 GB of dedicated VRAM</li><li><strong>DirectX®:</strong> 9.0c</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong> 1 GB HD space</li><li><strong>Controller:</strong> Gamepad support</li></ul><p style=""> </p><h3>Mac</h3><h4>Minimum</h4><ul><li><strong>OS:</strong> Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion)</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core 2 Duo or comparable</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2 GB RAM</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Geforce 8000 series (discrete) or Intel HD 3000 (integrated) GPU</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong> 1 GB HD space</li><li><strong>Controller:</strong> Gamepad support</li></ul><h4>Recommended</h4><ul><li><strong>OS:</strong> Mac OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion)</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel i5 or comparable</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Geforce 9800 GT or better with 1 GB of dedicated VRAM</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong> 1 GB HD space</li><li><strong>Controller:</strong> Gamepad support</li></ul>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>36713</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/81005/2428586-tokitori2_whatsmyname.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/81005/2428586-tokitori2_whatsmyname.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/81005/2428586-tokitori2_whatsmyname.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/81005/2428586-tokitori2_whatsmyname.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/81005/2428586-tokitori2_whatsmyname.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/81005/2428586-tokitori2_whatsmyname.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/81005/2428586-tokitori2_whatsmyname.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Toki Tori 2]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating/><original_release_date>2013-04-04 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-17/]]></api_detail_url><id>17</id><name><![CDATA[Mac]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/mac/3045-17/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[MAC]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-139/]]></api_detail_url><id>139</id><name><![CDATA[Wii U]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/wii-u/3045-139/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[WIIU]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/]]></api_detail_url><id>146</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 4]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS4]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/toki-tori-2/3030-36713/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[Grand Theft Auto Five

Unlike prior games in the series which focus on telling the story of a single player controlled character, GTA V features three central characters that the player is able to actively switch between at nearly any time during gameplay.</p><p style="">Rockstar Games states that this will be their largest open world game to date, boasting a total area greater than those of GTA: San Andreas, <a href="/grand-theft-auto-iv/3030-20457/" data-ref-id="3030-20457">GTA IV</a>, and <a href="/red-dead-redemption/3030-25249/" data-ref-id="3030-25249">Red Dead Redemption</a> combined. At a preview event in Spring 2013, reps said that the map in GTA V will be "<em>five times bigger than Red Dead Redemption</em>".</p><p style="">A first for the franchise, players aren't restricted from certain areas in the game and can now explore the entire environment at their leisure.</p><p style="">At <a href="/e3-2014/3015-7932/" data-ref-id="3015-7932">E3 2014</a>, it was announced that Grand Theft Auto V would be coming to the <a href="/playstation-4/3045-146/" data-ref-id="3045-146">PlayStation 4</a>, the <a href="/xbox-one/3045-145/" data-ref-id="3045-145">Xbox One</a>, and the <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC</a>. The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions were released on November 18, 2014  with the PC version releasing on April 14 2015 after numerous delays.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">The gameplay is similar to that of previous installments in the franchise. Players control one of <a href="/multiple-protagonists/3015-147/" data-ref-id="3015-147">three characters</a> in a free-roaming open-world environment. GTA V places a higher emphasis on heist missions, in which players can switch between the <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/on-the-fly-character-switching/3015-4385/" data-ref-id="3015-4385">various protagonists on the fly</a>, potentially allowing them to take control of a car or provide covering fire as they see fit. Players can also switch between the protagonists between missions at any time.</p><p style="">Many of the game elements found in GTA IV will return, such as: fake TV shows, minigames, clothing customization, and leisure activities, which now include tennis, yoga and base jumping. Dynamic missions have been introduced - similar to the random encounters of Red Dead Redemption, players may come across certain situations as they travel the world that they can choose whether or not to investigate.</p><p style="">The customary bevy of vehicles and weapons are available. A first in the series, weapons now boast the ability to be outfitted with custom parts; silencers, flashlights and more can be liberally applied to weapons of all types.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/60551/2365231-picture_7.png" data-ref-id="1300-2365231" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.51256281407035" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:51.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/60551/2365231-picture_7.png" data-ref-id="1300-2365231"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/60551/2365231-picture_7.png"></a></figure><p style="">GTA V splits its story between three playable characters, each representing a different side of Los Santos. Each character will have their own missions and side stories, as well as their own daily routines when not controlled by the player. The story progresses as the player completes missions with all three, which can allow the player to have insight into the events even when their current character does not. The player can switch between the characters at any time outside of missions and specific story moments.</p><h2>Characters</h2><p style="">The three playable protagonists of the game are a retired bank robber named Michael, a violent career criminal named Trevor, and a young repo man named Franklin.

The engine was extensively modified for <a href="/red-dead-redemption/3030-25249/" data-ref-id="3030-25249">Red Dead Redemption</a> after GTA IV and further refinements were reported to be made for GTA V and <a href="/max-payne-3/3030-23398/" data-ref-id="3030-23398">Max Payne 3</a>.</p><h2>Multiplayer</h2><p style="">The online multiplayer component, referred to as GTA Online, launched as a free download two weeks after the initial release of GTA V. The service officially launched on October 1st, 2013.</p><p style="">In GTA Online, up to 16 players (30 players on Xbox One and Playstation 4) engage in co-op missions, competitive deathmatches, races or free roam activities. An included in-game editor also allows players to design their own missions to share with other players. Nearly all of the components from the single player game are accessible in GTA Online including side activities such as golf and tennis. Additionally, the multiplayer features player progression and persistence with each player earning reputation points and money to spend on clothing, properties, vehicles, weapons, and more. Some elements of the world are also persistent among all players in GTA Online including for example the stock prices of various companies players can invest money into.</p><p style="">GTA Online is set prior to the events of GTA V's single player and features interactions with some of its characters.</p><p style="">Rockstar has stated that GTA Online will have extended support with additional content, including the possible addition of new areas at some point in the future.</p><p style="">GTA Online launched on October 1st, 2013, but had some major server issues after it launched, mainly because of "millions" of people logging in to the service at the same time. Rockstar confirmed that they were having server issues the same day, and have been working to fix the server issues since. They have posted multiple blog posts about the progress, and almost all the server issues have been resolved.</p><p style=""> </p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p style="">GTA V features 240 licensed tracks across 15 radio stations, and is the first game in the franchise to also feature an original score. The original score is produced by three separate composers, Edgar Froese of the electronic band Tangerine Dream, Woody Jackson who previously worked on the Red Dead Redemption and LA Noire soundtracks, and the hip-hop duo Alchemist and Oh No. Each composer's distinct sound is used to define the different characters and environments of the game.</p><p style="">The Xbox One, PS4 and PC version receives over 150 new tracks to the soundtrack, including several exclusive original songs from the following artists: Flying Lotus, Jamie Lidell, Freddie Gibbs and more.</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">East LOS FM</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><figure data-align="right" data-size="medium" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2542597-solidsnake-2.png" data-ref-id="1300-2542597" style="width: 180px" data-ratio="1" data-width="180" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2542597-solidsnake-2.png" data-ref-id="1300-2542597"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2840/2542597-solidsnake-2.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2840/2542597-solidsnake-2.png"></noscript></a></figure><p style=""><strong>Genre: </strong>Various Mexican Music</p><p style=""><strong>DJ:</strong> Camilo Lara &amp; Don Cheto</p><ul><li>La Vida Boheme - Radio Capital</li><li>Hechizeros Band - El Sonidito</li><li>La Liga ft.

common Spanish curse for frustration similar to "damn!") is a side-scrolling action game that resembles Capcom's <a href="/ghosts-n-goblins/3025-243/" data-ref-id="3025-243">Ghosts N' Goblins</a> franchise. The player passes through multiple regions of the fictional Kingdom of Castile, attempting to stop a demon lord who has opened a gateway to Hell and the many demonic minions that have poured out from same. The game heavily borrows from Spanish mythology especially, with most of its creatures and supernatural concepts being taken directly from ancient Hispanic legends.</p><p style="">The game is currently provided free of charge from the site of developer Locomalito (a.k.a. Juan Antonio Becerra) and was made available to the PC and Ouya in 2012. It is a popular game for <a href="/speedrun/3015-179/" data-ref-id="3015-179">speedrunners</a> due to its difficulty.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>36907</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/0/8960/2444739-maldita_castilla.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/8960/2444739-maldita_castilla.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/0/8960/2444739-maldita_castilla.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8960/2444739-maldita_castilla.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/8960/2444739-maldita_castilla.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/8960/2444739-maldita_castilla.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/0/8960/2444739-maldita_castilla.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Maldita Castilla]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating/><original_release_date>2012-12-12 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/]]></api_detail_url><id>146</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 4]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS4]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-152/]]></api_detail_url><id>152</id><name><![CDATA[Linux]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/linux/3045-152/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[LIN]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-154/]]></api_detail_url><id>154</id><name><![CDATA[Ouya]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/ouya/3045-154/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[OUYA]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/maldita-castilla/3030-36907/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[TLoU]]></aliases><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-36989/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2011-12-03 21:59:21</date_added><date_last_updated>2015-07-24 21:46:33</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[Joel and Ellie must survive in a post-apocalyptic world where a deadly parasitic fungus infects people's brains in this new PS3 exclusive third-person action-adventure game from Naughty Dog.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">The Last of Us is a <a href="/third-person-perspective/3015-464/" data-ref-id="3015-464">third-person</a> action-adventure game, set in a <a href="/apocalypse/3015-4640/" data-ref-id="3015-4640">post-apocalyptic world</a> where a deadly parasitic fungus (<i>Cordyceps unilateralis</i>) that infects the brains of ants suddenly adapts to humans and causes a large portion of the human race to turn into monsters, (also referred to as 'the infected' or 'clickers'), leaving the remaining survivors to turn to whatever asset they can to stay alive in this world now overrun by anarchy and desolation.</p><p style="">The player takes the role of <a href="/joel/3005-21586/" data-ref-id="3005-21586">Joel</a> (voiced by <a href="/troy-baker/3040-93651/" data-ref-id="3040-93651">Troy Baker</a>) and, with the help of 14-year-old orphan girl <a href="/ellie/3005-21585/" data-ref-id="3005-21585">Ellie</a> (voiced by <a href="/ashley-johnson/3040-101253/" data-ref-id="3040-101253">Ashley Johnson</a>), must try to survive at all costs, fending off both the infected and other desperate human survivors. Supplies and ammunition are scarce and the player will have to constantly evaluate the risk of searching for these supplies in the environment and risking unwanted and taxing confrontations.</p><p style="">There is speculation that the game takes place in the same universe as the <a href="../../uncharted/62-957/" rel="nofollow">Uncharted series</a>, due to a hidden newspaper headline in <a href="../../uncharted-3-drakes-deception/61-32982/" rel="nofollow">Uncharted 3</a>'s first level that vaguely refers to a deadly fungus that scientists are still "struggling to understand".</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">The Last of Us<i>'</i> combat primarily revolves around melee and crafting. The weapons in the game will be degradable, and the projectiles will mostly be crude instruments such as bricks. While firearms can be procured, ammunition is incredibly scarce, making every bullet count. Naughty Dog assured that The Last of Us would never result in the player running through the environment carelessly blind-firing an automatic rifle or pistol. Health doesn't regenerate, forcing the player to play much more conservatively than they might in other, more forgiving circumstances. The emphasis on player fragility helps accentuate the pressure of trying to survive in such a harsh world.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2142113-6944566467_ee039db8fe_z.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2142113" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2142113-6944566467_ee039db8fe_z.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2142113"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2142113-6944566467_ee039db8fe_z.jpg"></a><figcaption>The AI-controlled Ellie preparing to throw a brick at a hunter</figcaption></figure><p style="">The player takes up the role of Joel, while their partner Ellie (computer-controlled) stays at Joel’s side for a large portion of the game. While cooperative play will be absent from the game, Naughty Dog has stated that The Last of Us will not be ''one big escort mission.'' Instead, Ellie will act as a supportive ally rather than a frail victim: she can call out enemies for Joel and help from afar by throwing objects such as bricks. Ellie can die, but she can protect herself to some degree by using weapons or cunning to escape danger. In addition, it has also been hinted that she will assist the player in solving certain puzzles and/or situations which only she can help complete, although this has yet to elaborated upon.</p><p style="">The player will be forced to contend against both the infected and other humans (e.g. scavengers or bandits), although not every NPC they meet will be instantaneously hostile towards them. Each enemy type will have very distinct AI patterns, the humans being particularly competent: they can work together by relaying critical information to one another, flee, dynamically change their tactics based upon whether Joel has a gun or a melee weapon, and, if they know they're beat, surrender. Overall, the enemy AI is meant to be highly adaptable, offering up multiple dynamic variables for the player in regard to their choice of action and how enemies react to those choices. Naughty Dog has coined their specific AI programming the ''Balance of Power'.</p><p style="">The game also contains an inventory management and item combination system. At any time, Joel can access his backpack to combine or use items, such as a Molotov cocktail or med-kit. However, because, for instance, the same items used to craft a Molotov cocktail are the very ones you could also use to construct a med-kit and vice versa, the player is put in a position in which they must determine whether or not the type of item they wish to craft (offensive vs. defensive) is more valuable than the other in their current situation, further offering the player choice in how they tackle different scenarios.</p><p style="">Also unlike Uncharted, players can interact with items in the environment for the sake of background story rather than mere progression. For instance, when players see a movie poster, they can choose to interact with it or not. Items the player can interact with become highlighted and the player receives a button prompt.</p><h2>Plot</h2><h3>Summer</h3><figure data-ref-id="1300-2523103" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39162/2523103-8262795666_885c1e5d91_o.png" data-size="small" data-align="left" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39162/2523103-8262795666_885c1e5d91_o.png" data-ref-id="1300-2523103"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/39162/2523103-8262795666_885c1e5d91_o.png"></a><figcaption>The two co-protagonists, Ellie and Joel.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The Last of Us stars Joel, a 50-something man who is one of the only few remaining people left in the world, after a parasitic fungus began infecting its population; during the very early stages of the outbreak, 20 years before the main game begins, Joel's daughter Sarah is killed amidst the chaos.</p><p style="">Now, Joel is a smuggler, and his latest job is to help escort the 14 year old girl Ellie to the Fireflies'--a rebel organisation that opposes the Government regime--base of operations by the request of the Firefly leader Marlene, as Ellie is immune to the disease and her blood is thusly believed to be the key for creating a cure for the infection.</p><p style="">The two encounter many allies along their travels, though all of whom will either die or stay behind once they've done all they can do. Initially Joel is working alongside his smuggling partner Tess, though she is bitten by an infected and then decides to sacrifice herself to stall the pursuing Government authorities. Next there was Bill, an old friend of Joel and Tess who branched off on his own and lived alone in a small deserted town. He aids the two in getting across, but then retreats back to his safe haven.</p><p style="">Finally there is Henry and Sam, two brothers who were initially apart of a larger group, but broke apart and where attempting to reunite with whomever's left at the nearby radio station. They travel alongside Joel and Ellie, as the four fight their way through not only infected, but also 'Hunters' -- a human faction akin to bandits that kill and steal from whomever enters within their territory.</p><p style="">The four finally manage to reach the radio station, however the younger brother Sam was bitten earlier and turns overnight. He attacks Ellie, forcing Joel to react, but not before he is held at gunpoint by Henry. After much pleading from Joel, Henry kills his little brother, but only before he quickly pulls the gun on himself and commits suicide.</p><h3>Fall</h3><figure data-ref-id="1300-2523054" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39162/2523054-9146334158_19c4d15d07_o.jpg" data-size="small" data-align="right" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="1.1826315789474" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:118.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39162/2523054-9146334158_19c4d15d07_o.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2523054"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/39162/2523054-9146334158_19c4d15d07_o.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/39162/2523054-9146334158_19c4d15d07_o.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Joel and Ellie continue their travels until reaching a dam. Inside is a small settlement, lead by Joel's own brother and ex-Firefly Tommy.

Joel and Tommy are eventually able to catch her, and Joel then decides to carry on the duty of escorting Ellie.</p><p style="">The two finally reach an abandoned hospital--the Firefly base--only they arrive to find it deserted, with audio logs explaining that they had to move on from the area. With a new location set, the two begin to carry on their journey, only they are ambushed by Hunters on their way out. The two fight their way through to the exit, however Joel is severely wounded after falling being forced to fall from the first floor and landing on a small pipe, puncturing his stomach. Ellie is then forced to tend to his wounds, after setting up base in an abandoned house, and look for medicine.</p><h3>Winter</h3><figure data-ref-id="1300-2523100" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39162/2523100-8262795096_2587fc427c_o.png" data-size="small" data-align="left" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39162/2523100-8262795096_2587fc427c_o.png" data-ref-id="1300-2523100"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/39162/2523100-8262795096_2587fc427c_o.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/39162/2523100-8262795096_2587fc427c_o.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ellie on her own amidst the Winter season.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Ellie hunts deer for food, but her hunting is soon cut short as she encounters two men. They appear friendly at first, as the older man David sends the other to collect the medicine Ellie requires. She still expresses distrust of David, though the two are inevitably forced to work together to defend against a horde of infected. Ellie sets aside her suspicions and the two are able to ward the infected off.</p><p style="">However, as the two make camp, David reveals that he is the leader of the pack of Hunters that attacked them at the hospital earlier. Ellie quickly escapes, despite David still handing her the medicine, and quickly returns back to Joel.</p><p style="">David sends his men to follow her, however, forcing Ellie to ride away on horseback in an attempt to keep them away from Joel. After riding a fair distance, Ellie silently kills her way through the pack of Hunters, but only before she is eventually caught by David.</p><p style="">Now trapped within a butcher's shop, David inadvertently reveals that his group have resorted to cannibalism. However, his intended use for Ellie is not for food, but is instead sexual in nature. After Ellie rejects David's attempts to courting her into his group, he instead decides to kill her for food. While lying on a butcher's table, she bites David and quickly exclaims that she's infected. Amidst the confusion, she is able to escape.</p><p style="">Elsewhere, Joel has recovered, and upon realizing Ellie has gone missing, he then kills his way through the remaining Hunters at the house, and even succumbs to torturing (and ultimately killing) two of them in order to gain information of her whereabouts.</p><p style="">Ellie is soon cornered in a restaurant with David, after he sets fire to the exit to stop her from leaving. Nonetheless, Ellie is able to use her cunning and her honed skills in stealth to stab David -- only before she then proceeds to butcher him with his own machete. Joel, noticing the fire, arrives just after and tries to calm Ellie.</p><h3>Spring</h3><figure data-ref-id="1300-2550229" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2550229-the_giraffe_scene.png" data-size="small" data-align="right" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.53333333333333" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:53.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2550229-the_giraffe_scene.png" data-ref-id="1300-2550229"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2550229-the_giraffe_scene.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2550229-the_giraffe_scene.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>A rare moment of peace </figcaption></figure><p style="">Once again the two near upon their destination. Along the way they encounter a tower of giraffes, as they both share a serene moment while watching the gentle creatures walk by amidst the sunny backdrop. However, further along their travels, Joel and Ellie are inadvertently thrown underwater by a crumbling underground bridge. Joel is able to quickly reach Ellie, who cannot swim, and begins to resuscitate her. She doesn't appear to be waking up, and to make matters worse a couple of armed men arrive and knock Joel out.</p><p style="">He wakes inside a hospital, greeted by Marlene, and quickly realizes he made it to the Firefly base. Though currently alive, Ellie is not with him. Marlene explains to Joel that in order for them to extract the necessary samples to create a cure, Ellie must die in the process due to the infection residing within the brain.</p><p style="">Joel refuses to let them kill Ellie, and fights his way through a swath of Firefly soldiers until he reaches the surgery room. Upon there, he kills the head surgeon and takes Ellie in his arms, rushing through the corridors until he reaches the elevator. He heads down to the car park to find himself at gun point by Marlene, who pleads Joel to give Ellie back. Due to hiding a gun while simultaneously still holding onto Ellie, Joel is able to fire a round into Marlene before she can react. Now bleeding profusely on the floor, Marlene begs for her life, but Joel refuses claiming ''You'd only come after her'', and shoots Marlene point-blank in the head.</p><p style="">Ellie soon wakes up in Joel's car. Asking what had happened, Joel lies to her, stating that no cure exists, and that the Fireflies had already tried with other individuals who were immune and it didn't work. Ellie, both clearly confused and disappointed, appears to accepts this for the truth.</p><h3>Epilogue</h3><p style="">Joel and Ellie arrive on the outskirts of Tommy's civilization. Ellie stops Joel and expresses survivor's guilt over the deaths of Riley, Tess, and Sam, asking Joel to swear to her that what he said about the Fireflies is true. Joel does, and Ellie replies with a quiet, "Okay."</p><h3>Ending Ambiguity</h3><p style="">The Last of Us' was lauded for its intentionally ambiguous and mature ending, leaving it open to interpretation as to how Ellie would carry on from there regarding her relationship with Joel. About whether she'll continue to play happy families, or if she would instead attempt to move on elsewhere away from Joel. The Last of Us co-director Neil Druckmann's own interpretation was,</p><blockquote data-align="center" data-size="small"><p style="">It's Ellie waking up for the first time and realizing that she can't rely on him anymore. She knows that she has to leave him, and make her own decisions and her own mistakes.</p></blockquote><h2>Multiplayer</h2><p style="">The game features a multiplayer mode called Factions, where the players pick either the Fireflys or Hunters to play as. Much of the weapons and gameplay from the single player campaign is carried into the multiplayer, such as crafting, listening, limited resources, etc. Loot boxes are scattered around each level, which contain crafting items and ammunition for the players. The gameplay is designed to be slow and methodical, emphasizing teamwork and communication. Games consist of 4 vs 4 rounds in one of three game modes:</p><h4>Supply Raid</h4><p style="">Each team is given 20 respawns with the goal of collecting as many supplies as possible while eliminating the other team.</p><h4>Survivors</h4><p style="">This is a <a href="/no-respawn/3015-3176/" data-ref-id="3015-3176">no respawn </a>mode where each team tries to take out the other team to win a round. A match consists of the best of seven rounds.</p><h4>Interrogation</h4><p style="">This mode has unlimited respawns, with the goal being to down players and interrogate them, rather than kill them right away. Once enough interrogations are made, the location of the opposing team's lockbox is revealed. The first team to successfully open the other team's lockbox wins the round.</p><h2>Development</h2><figure data-align="right" data-size="medium" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2658776-tumblr_mph219kjg91ruzdhko1_1280.png" data-ref-id="1300-2658776" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.55859375" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:55.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2658776-tumblr_mph219kjg91ruzdhko1_1280.png" data-ref-id="1300-2658776"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2658776-tumblr_mph219kjg91ruzdhko1_1280.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2658776-tumblr_mph219kjg91ruzdhko1_1280.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Bruce Straley &amp; Neil Druckmann</figcaption></figure><p style="">The Last of Us was first teased to the public some time before the <a href="/spike-video-game-awards-2011/3015-7240/" data-ref-id="3015-7240">2011 Spike Video Game Awards</a>, when Sony posted a live-action teaser trailer made up of a montage of riots and panic spreading across the world, solemnly narrated by the voice of a man (now acknowledged as Joel) recalling subtle appreciation for mundane, day-to-day activities, only to end with stating that they were now "all gone". It also contained a short segment from a BBC Planet documentary about ants becoming infected with a type of fungus called the <i>Cordyceps unilateralis</i>. It was during the 2011 Spike Video Game Awards that Sony then officially announced The Last of Us via an 'in-engine' trailer. The trailer introduced the main protagonists, Joel and Ellie, and announced that <a href="/naughty-dog-inc/3010-827/" data-ref-id="3010-827">Naughty Dog</a> was developing it.</p><p style="">Originally The Last of Us was conceived by <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/neil-druckmann/3040-101255/" data-ref-id="3040-101255">Neil Druckmann</a> for a University project starring a police officer, based partly on the Hartigan character--even including the heart condition--from Frank Miller's <em>Sin City</em> franchise. This character would also have to defend a little girl amidst a zombie crisis. Players were to switch control between the police officer and the little girl whenever the officer's heart condition would act up, not entirely unlike how it was in The Last of Us.</p><p style="">The idea was ultimately scrapped, but Druckmann still wanted to carry on with the themes and concepts established with his original idea, but planned to express it via a comic book title 'The Turning' instead. This time, however, the police officer character was now a criminal. He pitched his idea for a six-issue story arc, though it was turned down by the publishers.</p><p style="">Now working at Naughty Dog, Druckmann still very much wanted to tell a story involving the same character relationships--most importantly involving a protector that must inevitably be protected by the younger character--and themes, and upon finishing work on Uncharted 2, he would brainstorm with fellow Naughty Dog developer and The Last of Us co-director <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/bruce-straley/3040-30254/" data-ref-id="3040-30254">Bruce Straley</a>.</p><p style="">Their first draft was called 'Mankind', and differed from The Last of Us in that the infection, while still the same <i>Cordyceps unilateralis </i>fungus<i>, </i>would only infect females. Furthermore, Ellie was to be a mute, though the story itself was still largely the same. Nonetheless, the idea of only females getting infected was scrapped due to disagreements with female Naughty Dog employees<i>; </i>Druckmann himself stated that it was a ''misogynistic idea''.</p><figure data-ref-id="1300-2526114" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2526114-bq8sk2ccyaap-hf.jpg+large.jpg" data-size="small" data-align="left" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.78082191780822" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:78.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2526114-bq8sk2ccyaap-hf.jpg+large.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2526114"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2526114-bq8sk2ccyaap-hf.jpg+large.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2526114-bq8sk2ccyaap-hf.jpg+large.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Concept art depicting an alternate ending.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Come 2010, the game's title was settled as The Last of Us, though the story was noticeably different. <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/tess/3005-26448/" data-ref-id="3005-26448">Tess</a>, recognized in the main game as a supporting character, was to be the primary antagonist. The ending especially differed greatly, as it featured Joel being beaten and tortured by Tess, while she is ultimately killed by Ellie -- which was to be her first ever kill. Druckmann thought that this draft lacked the character development they were trying to achieve, and that Joel in particular settled into the father-figure role too quickly.</p><p style="">The general relationship between Joel and Ellie was inspired, in part, by <a href="/ico/3030-9638/" data-ref-id="3030-9638">Ico</a>. The reliance <a href="/ico/3005-676/" data-ref-id="3005-676">Ico </a>and <a href="/yorda/3005-1174/" data-ref-id="3005-1174">Yorda</a> show towards each other in particular is what originated the idea of having a game featuring two simultaneous protagonists; two characters who cannot overcome the many perils they are to face on their own. Naughty Dog has also cited inspiration from a set of sequences in their own <a href="/uncharted-2-among-thieves/3030-22420/" data-ref-id="3030-22420">Uncharted 2</a>, in which <a href="/nathan-drake/3005-162/" data-ref-id="3005-162">Nathan Drake</a> and his Tibetan guide <a href="/tenzin/3005-12660/" data-ref-id="3005-12660">Tenzin</a> attempt to explore a large ice-encrusted cave. Initially, they wanted to develop this concept with a new <a href="/jak-daxter/3025-366/" data-ref-id="3025-366">Jak &amp; Daxter</a> game. Instead of carrying the same, original tone as the series' PS2 iterations, however, Naughty Dog planned on moving it out of its cartoon-ish origins and into a more realistic aesthetic; Jak was intended to be an actual human being, and Daxter was intended to function much like an ordinary weasel -- most notably lacking the ability to talk. This idea was put on the drawing board for the time being, and instead The Last of Us came to fruition.</p><p style="">The Last of Us was developed by a second team of Naughty Dog employees, as a result of the co-presidents deciding that each person's individual potential would be fully realized if they weren't as compressed just for the sake of developing a single game, Evan Wells particularly crediting the talent that they each respectively hold. <a href="/christophe-balestra/3040-30962/" data-ref-id="3040-30962">Christophe Balestra</a> tweeted that the game had been in development for at least two years as of the announcement alongside Uncharted 3, which marked the first time that Naughty Dog had split into multiple teams and had worked on more than one project at a time.</p><h3><a href="/e3-2012/3015-7024/" data-ref-id="3015-7024">E3 2012</a></h3><p style="">Ending the Sony Press Conference for the Electronic Entertainment Expo was the first publicly released gameplay demo for The Last of Us. It introduced a combat scenario to the audience, showing firsthand the tools of the trade Joel and Ellie must use to attempt to defend themselves from a small group of bandits, known as the 'hunters'. It was particularly adamant in showing the viewer the brutality and impulsive nature of the melee fights, as well as how the bandits would coordinate and respond based on Joel's current situation and amount of bullets he had.</p><p style="">It ended on an especially grim note, just after Joel executes a Hunter close-range with a shotgun while he begs for mercy.</p><h2>Ellen Page controversy</h2><figure data-ref-id="1300-2550236" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2550236-new-ellie.jpg" data-size="small" data-align="right" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.53166666666667" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:53.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2550236-new-ellie.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2550236"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2550236-new-ellie.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2550236-new-ellie.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Image showing Ellie's original (left) and current design.</figcaption></figure><p style="">After the game was released, Canadian actress <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/ellen-page/3040-102137/" data-ref-id="3040-102137">Ellen Page</a> expressed irritation after finding out that the character of Ellie, while voiced and mo-caped by Ashley Johnson, was inspired by her -- and accused Naughty Dog of ''ripping off'' her likeness.

currently under development from Slightly Mad Studios, the developer of the Need for Speed: Shift series.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Project CARS is community funded racing simulator developed by <a href="/slightly-mad-studios/3010-6578/" data-ref-id="3010-6578">Slightly Mad Studios</a> for <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC</a>, <a href="/linux/3045-152/" data-ref-id="3045-152">Linux</a>, <a href="/">PlayStation 4</a>, <a href="/">Xbox One</a>. A Wii U version was planned but eventually canceled in favor of waiting for new hardware announcements from Nintendo. The game is set to release on May 12, 2015 in North America. Since it is still in early alpha, many content deals are yet to be done, so there are placeholder names for many tracks and cars. Some are fictional, such as the Shifter Kart 01 and Formula B.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Project CARS is the first game to use Slightly Mad Studio's (SMS) new crowd-sourced funding project named WMD portal (World of Mass Development). Interested customers can purchase one of six different levels of membership at this point in development, ranging from "junior member" for 10 €, all the way up to "Senior Manager" for 25000 €. The amount of access gamers have to the game's development depends on what membership they purchased, so junior members get monthly builds and can post in the forums, but can't create new threads. The next level up, Team Member, can play weekly builds of the game and start threads in the forums. The top level of membership allows members to attend development meetings, play every build of the game, and are granted a dedicated sub forum. Funding for the game has reached its target of 3,750,000 € and therefore has been closed.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The following features are planned to be in the final release of the game:</p><h2>Features</h2><ul><li>Career Structure</li><li>Cloud-Based Social Network</li><li>Complete Day/Night Time Cycle</li><li>Co-op Career</li><li>Dedicated Servers and Matchmaking</li><li>Driving School</li><li>Dynamic Weather</li><li>Free Practice and Time Trial Modes</li><li>Full Race Weekend Format (practice, qualify, warmup, race)</li><li>Ghost Racing</li><li>Helmet Camera with head lean and look to apex</li><li>Living Tracks, which include track rubbering, drying of wet racing lines, and buildup of marbles</li><li>Pit2Car Radio Communication</li><li>Pit Stops</li><li>Portable/Mobile Apps</li><li>Reflective Windshield with Progressive Dirt</li><li>Safety Car</li><li>Telemetry Acquisition</li><li>Tire Deformation, including flat spots and punctures</li><li>TrackIR Support</li><li>Web Leaderboards</li><li>Wind and Ambient/Track Temperature, which will affect driving</li></ul><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The following cars and tracks appear in build 346:</p><h2>Cars</h2><ul><li>Alpine A450</li><li>Ariel Atom 300 Supercharged</li><li>Ariel Atom 500 V8 - 2011</li><li>Aston Martin Rapide S Hydrogen Hybrid</li><li>Aston Martin V12 Vantage GT3</li><li>Aston Martin V8 Vantage GT4</li><li>Audio R18 TDI</li><li>Audi R8 LMS Ultra</li><li>Audi R8 V10 plus</li><li>BAC Mono - 2011</li><li>BMW 1-Series M Coupe</li><li>BMW 320 Turbo Group 5</li><li>BMW M3 E30 Group A</li><li>BMW M3 GT</li><li>BMW M3 GT4</li><li>BMW Z4 GT3 - 2012</li><li>Caper Monterey Stockcar - 1990</li><li>Caterham SP/300.R</li><li>Caterham Seven Classic</li><li>Caterham Superlight R500</li><li>Ford Escort Mk1RS1600</li><li>Ford Focus RS</li><li>Ford Mustang Boss 302R1</li><li>Ford Mustang Cobra TransAm</li><li>Ford Sierra RS500 Cosworth Group A</li><li>Ford Zakspeed Capri Group 5 - 1980</li><li>Formula A (Generic Formula 1) - 2011</li><li>Formula B - 2011</li><li>Formula C</li><li>Formula Gulf 1000</li><li>Formula Rookie (Formula Ford) - 2012</li><li>Gumpert apollo S - 2011</li><li>Ginetta G40 Junior</li><li>Ginetta G55 GT3</li><li>Ginetta G55 GT4</li><li>Lotus 49 Cosworth</li><li>Lotus 72D Cosworth</li><li>Lotus 78 Cosworth - 1977</li><li>Lotus 98T Renault Turbo - 1986</li><li>Marek RP 219D LMP1</li><li>Marek RP 339H LMP1</li><li>McLaren 12C</li><li>McLaren 12C GT3</li><li>McLaren P1</li><li>Mercedes-Benz 190E 2.5-16 Evolution2 DTM</li><li>Mercedes-Benz 300SEL 6.8 AMG</li><li>Mercedes-Benz A45 AMG</li><li>Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG</li><li>Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG GT3</li><li>Mitsubisihi Lancer Evolution X FQ400</li><li>Oreca 03 Nissan</li><li>Pagani Huayra</li><li>Pagani Zonda R</li><li>Palmer Jaguar JP-LM - 2011</li><li>RWD P20 LMP2</li><li>RWD P30 LMP1</li><li>Radical SR3-RS</li><li>Radical SR8-RX</li><li>Renault Clio Cup</li><li>Ruf CTR3</li><li>Ruf RGT-8</li><li>Ruf RGT-8 GT3</li><li>Shifter Kart 125cc</li><li>Shifter Kart 250cc "SuperKart"</li></ul><h2>Tracks</h2><h3>Road Courses</h3><ul><li>Anhalt (Oschersleben)</li><li>Azure Circuit (Monaco)</li><li>Azure Coast (Country Road)</li><li>Connecticut Hill (Watkins Glenn)</li><li>Badenring (Hockenheim)</li><li>Bathurst (Mount Panorama)</li><li>Belgian Forest Circuit (Spa Francorchamps)</li><li>Besos (Catalunya)</li><li>Bologna (Imola)</li><li>California Highway (Country Road)</li><li>California Raceway (Willow Springs Raceway)</li><li>Derby (Donington Park)</li><li>Eifelwald (Nürburgring Nordschleife &amp;

However, Orochi's raw power creates the form of the giant, eight-headed Hydra. The apparently unbeatable monster brings chaos to the world once again, and in the chaos, the many warriors are either killed or scattered into parts unknown. When all hope seems lost, Kaguya is able to use her time reversing powers to rescue three warriors that survived a last-ditch battle with the monster; <a href="/sima-zhao/3005-17076/" data-ref-id="3005-17076">Sima Zhao</a>, <a href="/ma-chao/3005-3371/" data-ref-id="3005-3371">Ma Chao</a>, and <a href="/hanbei-takenaka/3005-22453/" data-ref-id="3005-22453">Hanbei Takenaka</a>. Given a second chance, these warriors must travel into the past and recruit others in order to alter the future and improve the odds. However, they are limited in that they can only travel back to times and places in the past that someone in the group actually experienced, and are further limited in that they can only travel as far back as the Hydra's first appearance due to the interference it causes in the timeline.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Unlike previous Warriors Orochi games, the story mode is not broken up by faction; instead, there is a single path that features a linear progression. New stages are unlocked as the player progresses through the chapters, though there are some side stages that can only be accessed after certain character bonds are raised to a high enough level. Alternate "Redux" versions of existing stages can also be unlocked by participating in chronologically preceding battles where success alters the flow of time.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Additionally, the story features multiple endings based on factors such as the number of characters that have been unlocked over the course of play. To view the best ending, the player must unlock every character in the game save for those unlocked by beating it.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Warriors Orochi 3 plays similarly to previous entries in the Orochi series, with the player taking control of teams of characters that can be swapped between on the fly. As in previous entries, each character is categorized as a specific class. The Power, Speed, and Technique classes all return from the previous games, with the addition of a fourth class called "Wonder." Wonder characters are capable of powerful counter attacks that can be followed with critical strikes.</p><h3>New Actions</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Warriors Orochi 3 features a number of mechanics new to the series.</p><ul><li>Dash Chain: Allows for smooth transition from dash attack to normal/charge attack.</li><li>Break Guard: A counter attack to knock an enemy back.</li><li>True Triple Attack: When a special gauge is filled, The player can invoke this attack to summon all three player characters in the player's team onto the battlefield at once. During a True Triple Attack, the player may continue to switch between characters on the fly. All enemies defeated with a TTA are guaranteed to drop items.</li><li>Switch Combo: Combo attacks can be chained as the player switches from one character to another, but doing so consumes Musou gauge energy.</li><li>Support Attack: A feature from Warriors Orochi 2, in Warriors Orochi 3, the chances of a support attack are tied to the bond levels between characters.</li></ul><h3>Duel Mode</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Duel Mode, first introduced in Warriors Orochi 3 Hyper on the Wii U and which will be included in Warriors Orochi 3 Ultimate, is a one on one battle that can be played against either the computer or a human opponent. Each player selects a team of three characters, as well as a set of four cards. Each card is mapped to one of the four directions on the D-pad. In battle, controls are identical to those in the main game, save for the ability to trigger card effects. Cards have a variety of effects ranging from dealing damage or restoring health/musou energy to imbuing elemental power or temporarily locking out the opponent's ability to switch characters. The battle is decided when all three characters on one player's team are defeated.</p><h2>Musou Battlefields</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Warriors Orochi 3 features a special mode called Musou Battlefields that allows players to create custom stages and share them online. The player may select any previously cleared stage to edit. Customizable elements are unlocked as the player progresses through the story mode. These options include:</p><ul><li>Officers encountered during the battle.</li><li>Officer dialogue. Any line that the player has heard during the course of play can be inserted.</li><li>The soldier types for all armies.</li><li>The background music.</li><li>Sound effect libraries from past Dynasty and Samurai Warriors games.</li><li>Enemy and ally army and officer morale and aggression.</li><li>The stage time limit.</li></ul>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>37022</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/2160634-box_wo3.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/2160634-box_wo3.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/2160634-box_wo3.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/2160634-box_wo3.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/2160634-box_wo3.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2160634-box_wo3.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/2160634-box_wo3.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Warriors

Force must travel through time and use heavy firepower and the ability to manipulate time to overcome their enemies.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Super T.I.M.E. Force is a retro side-scrolling shooter on the onset set in the year 198X, in outer-space, that focuses on time-manipulation. It was released on Xbox 360 and Xbox One on May 14th, 2014, with a "Ultra" edition PC release on August 25, 2014. The Playstation 4 and Vita version released on September 1, 2015.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-ref-id="1300-null" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1749/2599057-5054926104-STF_a.png" data-size="small" data-align="right" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-ratio="0" data-width="0" data-embed-type="image"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1749/2599057-5054926104-STF_a.png" data-ref-id="1300-null"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1749/2599057-5054926104-STF_a.png"></a><figcaption>Total mayhem</figcaption></figure><p style="">The game is a side-scrolling shooter, that has a unique time-manipulation mechanic. Every action a character takes (e.g. jumping, running, shooting, acquiring one of the various collectibles) is recorded and upon death, or at the press of a button can be rewinded and plays out again parallel to what is happening in real time with another player character.</p><p style="">This leads to multiple clones of player characters running and gunning at the same time. Another important mechanic is, that the player can save themselves from death. If an enemy shoots the player character, and the player rewinds to an earlier state and then proceeds to kill the enemy before he actually kills the first player character, that character is saved and can be picked up to stack power ups.</p><p style="">Every character has a normal attack and a special charge shot. There are multiple starting characters, and 13 unlockable characters.</p><p style="">The different levels feature two types of collectibles:</p><ul><li><strong> Shards</strong>, that upon shooting/collecting slow down time. They only show up after rewinding past the point they are to be collected. There are 3 on each level.</li><li><strong>Glorbs</strong>, that serve no gameplay purpose. They can be found in the level, or be killing enemies/destroying objects. When falling out of enemies/objects, the player has to be quick to catch them, because they shatter upon hitting the ground. There are 10 on each level.</li></ul><p style="">Most levels also feature Looker Shards that can only be obtained when the player reaches the Shard in a certain time. If the time limit is not met, collecting the shard will make a counter appear indicating the target time.</p><p style="">Upon completion of the game a new difficulty setting called Super Hardcore Mode is unlocked. In this mode each member of The Super Time Force can only die once.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style="">The story tells the exploits of Prof. Repeatski, later known as Cdr. Repeatski, a loser scientist who discovers time travel.</p><p style="">He uses the power time travel gives him to build a special time corps known as The Super Time Force. He recruits people from several periods in time to serve under him and his goal is to rewrite history to his liking. Which includes unsinking the lost city of Atlantis, so it can be used as a holiday resort, and preventing the extinction of the dinosaurs, because they are awesome.</p><p style="">Repeatski is opposed by the mysterious Dr. Infinity, who calls The Super Time Force terrorists, who don't care about the repercussions that come with changing the past.</p><p style=""> </p><h2>Playable Characters</h2><h3>Starting Characters</h3><p style=""> </p><h4>Jean Rambois</h4><ul><li>Weapon: Machine Gun</li><li>Charge Special: Rapid-Fire Spread</li></ul><h4>Aimy McKillin</h4><ul><li>Weapon: Sniper Rifle (bullets bounce off walls)</li><li>Charge Special: Laser Shot (shoots through walls)</li></ul><h4>Shieldy Blockerson</h4><ul><li>Weapon: Shield (melee bash attack/deflect projectiles)</li><li>Charge Special: Shield Orb (invulnerability inside a halo)</li></ul><p style=""> </p><h4>Unlockable Characters</h4><p style=""> </p><h4>Jef Leppard</h4><ul><li>Weapon: Bazooka (shots drop)</li><li>Charge Special: Rocket Shot (no drop, splash damage)</li></ul><h4>Zackasaurus</h4><ul><li>Weapon: Bite (Zack can also jump on enemy's heads to kill them)</li><li>Charge Special: Goo Spit</li></ul><h4>Lou Don Jim</h4><ul><li>Weapon: Laser Sword</li><li>Charge Special: Laser Sword Throw</li></ul><h4>Melanie Gibson</h4><ul><li>Weapon: Shotgun</li><li>Charge Special: Bigger Spread/Range Shotgun Blast</li></ul><h4>Cleo</h4><ul><li>Weapon: Multiple Boomerangs surrounding her</li><li>Charge Special: All Boomerangs are charged and fired at the enemy</li></ul><h4>Merlin</h4><ul><li>Weapon: Staff</li><li>Charge Special: Damage Rune</li></ul><h4>Stash</h4><ul><li>Weapon: Chainsaw</li><li>Charged Special: Charged up Pump Action Shotgun</li></ul><h4>Squirty Harry</h4><ul><li>Weapon: Magnum</li><li>Charge Special: Gas Cloud</li></ul><h4>Dolphin Lundgren</h4><ul><li>Weapon: Squeak</li><li>Charge Special: Gatling Gun</li></ul><h4>Cdr.

In order to save his beloved eatery, he sends the super time force back to 673 to steal the Holy Grail which he plans to sell online and pay off all of the franchise's debt.</p><h3>199X</h3><p style="">With the realization that babies are boring, Repeatski sends the team in to the future in order to find his grown up daughter and see how she is doing. However, once they get there, it seems that the future isn't quite what Repeatski thought it would be. It's up to the team to fix this post-apocalyptic landscape and return Cleo back to her father.</p><h3>3072</h3><p style="">The President sent Commander Repeatski a hilarious cat video but his browser does not have the right plug-ins to play it.

The project was initially announced on February 8, 2012, through the website Kickstarter.com. <a href="/tim-schafer/3040-2860/" data-ref-id="3040-2860">Tim Schafer</a> and Double Fine Productions desired to create an old-school <a href="/point-and-click/3015-75/" data-ref-id="3015-75">point-and-click</a> adventure game, but due to lack of publisher interest in the genre, they chose to pursue funding through crowdsourcing.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The development of the project is being documented by 2 Player Productions, who are creating a serialized video series chronicling the process. Additionally, project backers have access to a private community forum to offer their input on the development.

The game focuses on two parallel stories of children, a boy and a girl, who yearn to break free from the banalities of their respective lives and follows them as they attempt to alter their fates. The boy lives a solitary life under the care of a motherly computer, but wishes to break free, while the girl has been chosen as sacrifice to a terrible sea monster by her own village and decides to fight back.</p><h2>Kickstarter Campaign</h2><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7030/2419206-redsprint.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2419206" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.65920651068159" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:65.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7030/2419206-redsprint.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2419206"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7030/2419206-redsprint.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7030/2419206-redsprint.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The game's codename, 'Reds'.</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The project's original goal was to collect $400,000 in pledges by March 13, 2012; the minimum pledge amount required for the project to go forward, with $300,000 going toward the game's development and the remaining amount toward the documentary series. This sum was quickly met within nine hours of the announcement. Pledges continued to climb, eventually reaching just over one million dollars in its first day. All donated funds in excess of the target were put towards the game's development, as well as the documentary.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">On February 24, 2012, Double Fine posted another update to the project's Kickstarter page, indicating that with the larger-than-expected donation amount, the scope of the project had changed. Because of this, Double Fine extended the development schedule beyond its initially stated scope, and they also indicated that some Kickstarter donation rewards would likely be sent out later than originally intended. The update also served as an announcement for new rewards for various donation tiers. Notably, everyone that donated at least $100 toward the game will now also receive a physical copy of the game on disc in addition to all other rewards and benefits previously promised.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">On March 13, 2012, the Kickstarter drive officially closed with a grand total of $3,335,235 from 87,138 backers.

By making a $15 purchase through PayPal, individuals who wished to support the project but missed the Kickstarter deadline could secure a copy of the game along with the $15-tier rewards of the original Kickstarter.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">On January 15, 2013, Double Fine added a couple of options for those who wished to further support the project. For the price of $40 for an unsigned copy and $60 for a signed copy, consumers could obtain a 13" by 19" art print by Majus, an intern who spent 3 months working on the project. Additionally, slacker backers could also send any other amount of money, functioning as a tip to the team. All these options were created for backers who wanted to pitch in a little more in the wake of a documentary episode where the project's financial struggles were somewhat detailed.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The Act 1 beta was released to backers on January 14, 2014 via distributed Humble Steam codes.

Players try to force their opponents to move their controllers enough to be eliminated while still trying to keep their own controller still and protected. The game doesn’t have any specific rules as it is mainly a party game and the goal is to simply be the last person standing.</p><p style="">Because bluetooth only supports a limited number of simultaneous connections, the highest number of controllers supported is 7 on the PS3 or Mac. The PS4 version is limited further limited, only supporting a maximum of 4. Prototype versions of the game have been shown at parties and conventions with multiple networked computers supporting up to 18 controllers.</p><p style="">It is not available separately, and is instead available as one of the four games in the <a href="/sportsfriends/3030-43545/" data-ref-id="3030-43545">Sportsfriends</a> collection.</p><h2>Game Modes and Modifiers</h2><p style="">The game provides a number of settings to facilitate many types of games.</p><h3>Game Options</h3><p style="">A variety of settings are available to customize the gameplay:</p><ul><li><strong>Sensitivity</strong>: Adjust from 1 to 10 to set an level of physicality appropriate to your available game space.</li><li><strong>Announcer</strong>: Pick from <a href="/doug-wilson/3040-55771/" data-ref-id="3040-55771">Doug Wilson</a>, <a href="/bennett-foddy/3040-103084/" data-ref-id="3040-103084">Bennett Foddy</a>, <a href="/sarah-elmaleh/3040-108197/" data-ref-id="3040-108197">Sarah Elmaleh</a>, Wilson's mother, or any of them at random.</li><li><strong>Speed-ups</strong>: Choose whether the music speeds up occasionally</li><li><strong>Freezes</strong>: Choose whether the music occasionally freezes, requiring the players to reciprocate</li><li><strong>Teams</strong>: Choose between <a href="/deathmatch/3015-451/" data-ref-id="3015-451">free-for-all</a>, manual team assignment (each button on a controller will pick a different team color before the round starts), two teams with preset colors, or randomized teams each round.</li><li><strong>Invincibility</strong>: Choose whether players may hold down the trigger on their controller for brief periods of invincibility.</li><li><strong>Score tally</strong>: Choose whether to display the number of rounds each player has won.</li></ul><h3>Secret Options</h3><p style="">Entering the birth year of Johann Sebastian Bach, 1685, will unlock additional secret options:</p><ul><li><strong>Extra Announcers</strong>: Adds <a href="/nick-suttner/3040-99176/" data-ref-id="3040-99176">Nick Suttner</a>, Julie Heyde (fellow experimental game creator), <a href="/ramiro-corbetta/3040-104245/" data-ref-id="3040-104245">Ramiro Corbetta</a>, the narrator of <a href="/the-stanley-parable/3030-43344/" data-ref-id="3030-43344">The Stanley Parable</a>, and <a href="/rucks/3005-19712/" data-ref-id="3005-19712">Rucks</a> to the list of announcers.</li><li><strong>Change frequency</strong>: Choose between Normal, Often, and Seldom for how often the tempo of the music changes.</li><li><strong>Conductor mode</strong>: Choose whether one player will play the role of the conductor, waiving their controller or pressing buttons to dictate the pace of the music.</li><li><strong>Sudden Death</strong>: Choose whether, after a a certain period of time, a round will go into an extra-sensitive sudden death round.</li><li><strong>Allow No Winners</strong>: Choose whether to delay the end-of-round invincibility for the final remaining player.</li><li><strong>Invincibility</strong> sliders: tweak how long invincibility may last, and how fast it recharges.</li><li><strong>Lives</strong>: Give players from 1-9 or infinite lives and set how long it takes to respawn after being eliminated (1-30 sec).</li><li><strong>Resurrection</strong>: enable to allow eliminated players to revive themselves when out of lives by holding the trigger and remaining absolutely still while the light blinks brightly to alert other players. Choose how many revival attempts may be made and how long the revival process takes.</li></ul><h3>Alpha Options</h3><p style="">These were additional settings available in the text configuration file of the alpha build distributed to kickstarter backers.</p><ul><li><strong>Traitor</strong>: The same as teams, except every team has one traitor. The traitor can not win with his team and vice versa. At the beginning of each round, one controller on each team will gently rumble. That person is the traitor. If multiple members of the same team are left at the end of the game with a traitor, the game does not end until either the traitor is eliminated or is the last person standing.</li><li><strong>VIPs</strong>: (aka Kings) Similar to teams, but with one player on each team with a slightly brighter light. If the VIP of a team is eliminated, their entire team is eliminated with them.</li><li><strong>Dark Joust</strong>: The orb on top of the move controllers is off by default regardless of whether a player is playing or eliminated. When a live controller is jostled, the light will flicker briefly, and when eliminated it will light up red for around 1 second.</li><li><strong>Invincibility</strong>: The trigger on the controller may be held down to provide invincibility to motion, during which, the color of the orb changes to white. The invincibility time is limited and indicated by the brightness of the controller's orb dimming quickly while used, and recharging slowly while unused. If a player exhausts their light completely by use of the trigger, they are automatically eliminated.</li><li><strong>Hit Points</strong>: Instead of motion either eliminating a player or doing nothing, all motion will reduce the health of a player, indicated by the brightness of their colored orb. The more severe a single motion a controller is subjected to, the more it dims.</li></ul><h3>Alternate Play Style Suggestions</h3><p style=""><strong>Multi-Headed Teams</strong>: Form teams that all have to hold a single controller simultaneously.</p><p style=""><strong>Darkness</strong>: Played in a dark environment, the only light available is from the glowing balls on top of the move controller. Combine with Dark Joust for an extra stealthy variant.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>37591</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/1/15063/2633841-jsjoust-logo2.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15063/2633841-jsjoust-logo2.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/1/15063/2633841-jsjoust-logo2.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15063/2633841-jsjoust-logo2.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/15063/2633841-jsjoust-logo2.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15063/2633841-jsjoust-logo2.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/1/15063/2633841-jsjoust-logo2.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Johann Sebastian Joust]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating/><original_release_date>2014-05-06 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-17/]]></api_detail_url><id>17</id><name><![CDATA[Mac]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/mac/3045-17/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[MAC]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-88/]]></api_detail_url><id>88</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation Network (PS3)]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-network-ps3/3045-88/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3N]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/]]></api_detail_url><id>146</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 4]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS4]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/johann-sebastian-joust/3030-37591/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-37628/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2012-03-01 13:42:10</date_added><date_last_updated>2014-12-05 10:11:52</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[Loadout is a third-person shooter featuring fully customizable weapons and over-the-top violence.

Wasteland 2 is fan-funded from a successful Kickstarter campaign.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Wasteland 2 is a sequel to the 1988 cult classic, <a href="/wasteland/3030-12134/" data-ref-id="3030-12134">Wasteland;</a> it is being developed by <a href="/inxile-entertainment-inc/3010-3966/" data-ref-id="3010-3966">inXile Entertainment</a> with a team that includes many figures responsible for the original game. Wasteland 2 is a top-down, turn-based, squad-based RPG in which the player controls a group of Desert Rangers.</p><p style="">The game was released for <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC</a>, <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/mac/3045-17/" data-ref-id="3045-17">Mac</a>, and <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/linux/3045-152/" data-ref-id="3045-152">Linux</a> on September 19, 2014. Announced for a console release on <a href="/xbox-one/3045-145/" data-ref-id="3045-145">Xbox One</a> and <a href="/playstation-4/3045-146/" data-ref-id="3045-146">PlayStation 4</a>. </p><h2>Story</h2><p style="">Wasteland 2 takes place in <a href="/apocalypse/3015-4640/" data-ref-id="3015-4640">post-apocalyptic</a> America. The first game focused on the faction known as <a href="/desert-rangers/3015-7461/" data-ref-id="3015-7461">Desert Rangers</a>, who modeled themselves after the pre-war rangers of Texas and Arizona. The first Desert Rangers were U.S. Army engineers, who in hopes of surviving nuclear holocaust and it's aftermath took over a newly built federal prison. They released the prisoners into the wastes to make space, and renamed the prison to Ranger Center.</p><p style="">In time several survivalist communities were invited to join the Rangers and the Center. By 2087 the Ranger Center became one of the most powerful and prosperous communities in the wastes. Wasteland 2 will be set somewhere in southwestern US, not long after the events of the first game.</p><h2>Development</h2><h3>Kickstarter</h3><p style="">The game was being developed with the aid of crowdfunding through <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/" rel="nofollow">Kickstarter.com</a>. The drive began on March 13, 2012. Their target amount for the campaign was $900,000, and if the campaign did not exceed one million dollars, Brian Fargo was going to pledge an additional hundred thousand himself. However, like the <a href="/untitled-double-fine-adventure/3030-37448/" data-ref-id="3030-37448">Double Fine Adventure</a> Kickstarter campaign, the drive for funds proved successful and their goal was surpassed within days.</p><p style="">By the end, the project more than tripled on the planed $900.000, amassing $2,993,252 on the Kickstarter alone. Wasteland 2's development has already been mapped out based on the amount of funds received, and if certain targets beyond the required goal can be met, more content will be added to to the game and release on additional platforms. Both fans and newcomers to the series shared their ideas and things they'd like/wouldn't like to see in the game with InXile Entertainment on the <a href="http://wasteland.inxile-entertainment.com/forum/index.php" rel="nofollow">official Wasteland 2 forum</a>.</p><h3>Team</h3><p style="">Many people that worked on the previous Wasteland game were hired by <a href="/brian-fargo/3040-2354/" data-ref-id="3040-2354">Brian Fargo</a> to work on the sequel.

The world has been ravaged by a disease turning people into monsters. The player takes the role of "You" and has to explore the grotesque and twisted surroundings in search of supplies and an escape route. While contending with hunger and declining mental health. As he explores he encounters characters and situations which call into question the nature of reality and his perception of it.</p><p style="">As the story progresses, certain aspects of the environment change in such a way that brings into question the protagonist's mental health. For example, doors that were locked will suddenly be open or solid walls will become decayed to the point that they can be climbed through. By "looking deeply" into dusty mirrors the protagonist is transported between different locations, and can move between different areas via a series of holes that lead into bizarre hallways of flesh and organs. This navigation system links the world in a seemingly illogical way that distorts distances and reinforces the insanity motif that runs through the game.</p><p style="">The protagonist collects various food stuffs, pills, toys, tools and notes which can be inspected as well as consumed or read, when appropriate. Batteries are also a key commodity as they are needed to power the player's flashlight, and many objects and locations cannot be inspected unless they are properly illuminated. Statistics are communicated directly through the protagonist by him declaring his current needs with statements such as, "I'm getting tired" or, "I'm starving" rather than a heads up display of a health bar or equivalent. The protagonist quickly acquires a map and marks off open doors, blocked paths and points of interest as they are discovered, a la <a href="/silent-hill/3025-356/" data-ref-id="3025-356">Silent Hill</a>.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Stealth</h3><p style="">The protagonist starts out without a weapon or any means of fighting the monsters. His only way of getting past the monsters is to hide in an alcove and sneak past them. Alternatively, he can bait them into walking past a hiding spot with chunks of rotting <a href="/meat/3055-267/" data-ref-id="3055-267">meat</a>, then hide and wait for the monster to pass.</p><p style="">The monsters are attracted to his <a href="/flashlight/3055-156/" data-ref-id="3055-156">flashlight</a>, so he has to choose between seeing what's in front of him and attracting every monster nearby. Emergency <a href="/flare/3055-973/" data-ref-id="3055-973">flares</a> can be used to stun the monsters for a short time, allowing the player run past them unharmed.</p><h3>Combat</h3><p style="">Once a firearm has been acquired, the protagonist must enter a firing stance to shoot it. Once in firing stance, he will remain facing the same direction, allowing him to back away from monsters while still keeping aim. His pistol can hit monsters from a long range, but the noise attracts other monsters nearby. He can also aim at an upward angle, allowing for head shots that will drop enemies faster but requires closer proximity to the target, or aim downward to shoot at their legs, staggering them.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33013/2189181-2012_04_24_00002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2189181" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="960" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 960px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33013/2189181-2012_04_24_00002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2189181"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/3/33013/2189181-2012_04_24_00002.jpg"></a><figcaption>The Lone Survivor.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The game is exceptionally vague with its story up front, the protagonist is unsure how this situation came to be or how long he's been trapped in his apartment. He simply explains that some unknown disease has spread through the known world, killing off almost everyone and creating horrible monsters that wander in search of flesh. He even refuses to divulge his name, claiming it doesn't matter, and expressing his only desire is to not die alone.</p><p style="">The player can piece together what happened through notes, diary entries and messages scrawled crudely on walls. It is unclear whether the characters that the protagonist encounters are real or projections of his psyche. They disappear regularly or are revealed to be corpses, long deceased. He also has a tendency to converse with inanimate objects such as <a href="/chuck-the-plant/3005-10698/" data-ref-id="3005-10698">Chuck</a>, the house plant located in the hall outside the main character's apartment, and the sleepy cat plush the character carries with him.</p><p style="">In addition to the main plot, there are a few survivors the protagonist can help. Some give him items in return, but they mainly stabilize his mental health. Other things, like eating good food, getting enough sleep, and bringing some semblance of normalcy back to life also increases his sanity.</p><p style="">Over the course of the game, he also collects several pills. Taking these lets him sleep on an empty stomach, but causes him to have strange dreams. Some give him items, some ask him questions, some affect his sanity. His sanity determines what happens to him when he finally escapes.</p><p style="">There are currently 3 known endings, with the possibility of a 4th ending that might be added later.</p><h2>PlayStation 3 and Vita Versions</h2><p style="">This updated version of Lone Survivor, being billed as "The Director's Cut," features expanded content exclusive to the PS3 and Vita. According to a post by Byrne on the <a href="http://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/03/13/indie-horror-hit-lone-survivor-coming-to-ps3-ps-vita/" rel="nofollow">PlayStation Blog</a>, this includes over 20 new items, improved lighting system, two new "extensive" sidequests and a new "Yellow" ending, which will feature new background music. The Vita version also has touchscreen controls added. This version supports <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/cross-save/3015-7556/" data-ref-id="3015-7556">cross-save</a> and <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/cross-buy/3015-7554/" data-ref-id="3015-7554">cross-buy</a> across both hardware platforms, and was released on the PlayStation Store on September 24th, 2013.</p><p style="">This version was later ported to PlayStation 4

Instead, they communicate with an off screen character through her contraband phone while using their device (iPhone, iPad, PC, or Mac) to manipulate security cameras, hack computers, and open and close doors to facilitate her escape from the shadowy Overseer. </p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">The player navigates Hope through obstacles and enemies by setting off various elements using the environment. They can expand a field of view using a widen gesture using two fingers or narrow using a pinch on the touch screen. Although not a direct set of rules have been revealed, it does appear to give the player the ability to command hope down a certain path while combating enemies using a stun gun. The concept does strike a resemblance to <a href="/ghost-trick-phantom-detective/3030-28028/" data-ref-id="3030-28028">Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective</a> although with a survival-horror atmosphere.</p><h2>Story</h2><h3>Main Characters</h3><h4>Hope</h4><p style="">Very little is known about Hope's origin but so far it appears that she is captive in an environment by a group of soldiers and a faceless enemy named "The Overseer".</p><h3>Plot</h3><p style=""><a href="/republique/3030-37963/" data-ref-id="3030-37963">Republique</a>'s story, which is inspired by George Orwell's 1984, focuses on a captive named Hope who is attempting to escape her mysterious oppressors. By accessing an off screen character, controlled by the player, Hope will evade her captors through scenarios that the player can alter to make it possible for her to escape.</p><h4> </h4>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>37963</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/1/16944/2694769-republique_promoart.jpeg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/16944/2694769-republique_promoart.jpeg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/1/16944/2694769-republique_promoart.jpeg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/16944/2694769-republique_promoart.jpeg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/16944/2694769-republique_promoart.jpeg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/16944/2694769-republique_promoart.jpeg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/1/16944/2694769-republique_promoart.jpeg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Republique]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating/><original_release_date>2013-12-19 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-17/]]></api_detail_url><id>17</id><name><![CDATA[Mac]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/mac/3045-17/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[MAC]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-96/]]></api_detail_url><id>96</id><name><![CDATA[iPhone]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/iphone/3045-96/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[IPHN]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-121/]]></api_detail_url><id>121</id><name><![CDATA[iPad]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/ipad/3045-121/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[IPAD]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-123/]]></api_detail_url><id>123</id><name><![CDATA[Android]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/android/3045-123/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[ANDR]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/]]></api_detail_url><id>146</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 4]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS4]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/republique/3030-37963/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-37976/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2012-04-12 15:54:49</date_added><date_last_updated>2015-05-19 18:13:46</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[A sidescrolling action-adventure that takes inspiration from Super Metroid and other "Metroidvania" games.

Each class has its own special ability and unique set of weapons.</p><h3>Archer</h3><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/26636/2354812-archer_205x300.png" data-ref-id="1300-2354812" data-size="small" style="width: 205px" data-ratio="1.4634146341463" data-width="205" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:146.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/26636/2354812-archer_205x300.png" data-ref-id="1300-2354812"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/26636/2354812-archer_205x300.png"></a><figcaption>Archer</figcaption></figure><p style="">The archer is the ranged weapon specialist. He is best used in a support role to deliver damage to enemies from far to mid range. The archer is considerably more vulnerable in melee, when compared to the other classes. The archer's ability to inflict decent damage at long range makes him a great defensive class for harassing the enemy's front lines and keeping them off objective points. When using javelins the archer can be viable at melee range as well, thrusting them from behind a shield. Available weapons include bows, crossbows, javelins, slings, daggers, cudgels, and shields. The archer also gets a choice of various ammunition types for bows and slings.</p><p style=""><b>Special Ability:</b> Rogue - Does +%50 backstab damage.</p><h3>Man-at-arms</h3><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/26636/2354811-amaa_205x300.png" data-ref-id="1300-2354811" data-size="small" style="width: 205px" data-ratio="1.4634146341463" data-width="205" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:146.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/26636/2354811-amaa_205x300.png" data-ref-id="1300-2354811"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/26636/2354811-amaa_205x300.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/26636/2354811-amaa_205x300.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Man-at-arms</figcaption></figure><p style="">The man-at-arms is the lightest melee class, and relies heavily on evasion and speed abilities to land hits while trying to avoid enemy attacks. He specializes in one handed weapons and has the option of bringing a shield into battle. The man-at-arms is best played on the fringes of a battle. His speed allows him to move in and out of fights slipping in brutal hits. A good man-at-arms can evade the slow and heavy swings of a vanguard or knight, closing the distance rapidly to deliver the killing blow. Available weapons include swords, axes, clubs, staves, daggers, smoke bombs, fire pots, and shields.</p><p style=""><b>Special Ability:</b> Elusive - Can perform dodges</p><p style=""> </p><h3>Vanguard</h3><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/26636/2354813-vanguard_205x300.png" data-ref-id="1300-2354813" data-size="small" style="width: 205px" data-ratio="1.4634146341463" data-width="205" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:146.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/26636/2354813-vanguard_205x300.png" data-ref-id="1300-2354813"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/26636/2354813-vanguard_205x300.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/26636/2354813-vanguard_205x300.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Vanguard</figcaption></figure><p style="">The vanguard is an imposing aggressive force which forms the front line of an army. His weapons have extremely long reach and deal incredible damage. Generally making up a good portion of a team, the vanguard is typically the core warrior in battle. He has a large variety of weapons, most of which have extreme range (enough to kick an enemy away and still hit him with a swing). His charge ability can one-shot the lower armoured classes, though it can be supremely costly if missed. The vanguard is an all-around class capable of any role. Available weapons include poleaxes, polehammers, spears, greatswords, billhooks, throwing axes, and throwing knives.</p><p style=""><b>Special Ability:</b> Charge - Can sprint attack into battle.</p><h3>Knight</h3><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/26636/2354810-aknight_205x300.png" data-ref-id="1300-2354810" data-size="small" style="width: 205px" data-ratio="1.4634146341463" data-width="205" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:146.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/26636/2354810-aknight_205x300.png" data-ref-id="1300-2354810"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/26636/2354810-aknight_205x300.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/26636/2354810-aknight_205x300.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Knight</figcaption></figure><p style="">The most powerful tank melee unit on the battlefield. The knight's damage output and armour levels are offset by the lack of agility and generally slower weapons he wields. His weapons are typically slow and heavy, but absolutely devastating when they connect. Knights are slow moving, but they can take significantly more damage than the other classes. Knights often move the front line and charge into large groups. His imposing frame and plate armour make him ideal for standing ground and defending a point. Only a headshot from a heavy crossbow can kill a knight in one hit. Available weapons include one handed, bastard, and two handed swords, axes, hammers, flails, throwing axes, and shields.</p><p style=""><b>Special Ability:</b> Tank – Can absorb additional damage and takes less stamina to block incoming blows.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><h3><ins><strong>Archer</strong></ins></h3><h4> </h4><h4>Bows</h4><ul><li>Longbow- A bow with a good mix of speed, damage, and range.

The attackers on each map must accomplish a series of objectives unique to each map, ranging from setting a farm on fire to poisoning well water with diseased corpses. The defenders must prevent the attackers from completing these objectives within the time limit. Considered to be the core mode of Chivalry.</p><h4><ins>Last Team Standing</ins></h4><p style="">A battle mode with Counter-Strike style spawning rules. If a player dies, they must wait until the next round to respawn. The only objective is the kill the enemy to the last man.</p><h4><ins>Team Deathmatch</ins></h4><p style="">Traditional team deathmatch with a twist. Once a team reaches the kill limit, the opposing team does not respawn. The winning team must then fight to exterminate the opposing force to achieve total victory.</p><h4><ins>King of the Hill</ins></h4><p style="">The teams battle over a central platform, earning capture time when the opposing team does not control the platform. Hold the center for the allotted time to win.</p><h4><ins>Capture the Flag</ins></h4><p style="">The classic two flag CTF setup. Players who pick up the flag are unable to use their weapons, but the flag acts like a Vanguard spear. A team's flag must be in their base in order for them to capture the enemy flag. First team to three captures wins.</p><h4><ins>Free for All</ins></h4><p style="">Traditional deathmatch mode. The player with the most kills when time expires wins. Every man for themselves!</p><h4><ins>Duel</ins></h4><p style="">Added in Content Update 1. Players enter a lobby where they may challenge other players to one-on-one combat, or join the pool and be automatically assigned opponents. The player with the most duel victories when time expires is the winner.</p><h2>Environments</h2><p style="">The game initially included 7 different environments for player to battle in. Each stage includes their own unique objectives. A free content update on January 31, 2013 added 13 new maps: one team objective map, two maps which can play a variety of modes, and ten small maps for use with the newly added Duel mode.</p><h3>Stoneshill (Team Objective)</h3><p style="">The Mason Order has managed to sneak into the Stoneshill valley undiscovered aiming to end the still short rule of the Agathian steward residing here in his opulent Royal Palace. War comes to Stoneshill and it seems the quiet people of the sleepy village here are wholly unprepared. If the tenants of the Agathian Knighthood hold true, the Agathian forces stationed here will need to take up arms and face their fate, not only to ensure the safety of their named king’s subjects, but to ensure their continued claim to their homeland.</p><p style="">The outside area, as well as the throne room can be used for Team Deathmatch and Last Team Standing.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/26636/2354817-stoneshill5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2354817" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/26636/2354817-stoneshill5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2354817"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/26636/2354817-stoneshill5.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/26636/2354817-stoneshill5.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Stoneshill</figcaption></figure><p style="">Mason</p><ul><li>Slaughter the peasants and burn the village.</li><li>Breach the keep with the battering ram.</li><li>Kill the king.</li></ul><p style="">Agatha</p><ul><li>Protect the village and the peasants.</li><li>Defend the keep.</li><li>Protect the king.</li></ul><h4>Arena (Various Modes)</h4><p style="">You have been chosen to lay your life down for the glory of the kingdom.

href="/rayman-origins/3030-31721/" data-ref-id="3030-31721">Rayman Origins</a>. On its lead-platform, the Wii U, It features asymmetrical co-op for up to five players total with one player using the Wii U GamePad and the remaining four either using <a href="/wii-remote/3000-13/" data-ref-id="3000-13">Wii Remotes</a> or Wii U Pro Controllers. In Japan, Rayman Legends is being published by <a href="/nintendo/3010-90/" data-ref-id="3010-90">Nintendo</a> and thus remains Wii U exclusive in that region.</p><h2>Platform Exclusive Contents</h2><h3>Wii U Version</h3><p style="">Aside from the touch-screen levels featuring Murphy that also appear in the Vita version, the Wii U release will receive an exclusive "Funky Ray" bonus costume to unlock for players who have downloaded and played the <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/rayman-legends-challenges-app/3030-41651/" data-ref-id="3030-41651">Rayman Legends Challenges App</a> before 28 August, 2013. Players will also have the Online Challenges cups they earned and Level of Awesomeness transferred to Rayman Legends. Nintendo announced that the Wii U version will also have exclusive <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/mario/3005-177/" data-ref-id="3005-177">Mario</a> and <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/luigi/3005-370/" data-ref-id="3005-370">Luigi </a>costumes for Rayman and Globox.</p><h3>PSVita Version</h3><p style="">This version will include the Murphy touch-levels as well as five exclusive levels that are designed for the back-touch pad of the Vita. Also, two exclusive costumes (a Prince of Persia costume for Rayman and a Splinter Cell costume for Globox) come with this version.</p><h2>History</h2><p style="">On April 27 2012, an internal demonstration video showing a sequel to <a href="/ubisoft-entertainment/3010-82/" data-ref-id="3010-82">Ubisoft</a>'s critical hit, Rayman Origins leaked to a French website, and spread its way around the internet from there.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2191275-rayman_legends_rabbids_nfc1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2191275" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.58781362007168" data-width="480" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:58.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2191275-rayman_legends_rabbids_nfc1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2191275"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82063/2191275-rayman_legends_rabbids_nfc1.jpg"></a><figcaption>NFC Concept with a Rabbid figurine. </figcaption></figure><p style="">Shortly after the leak occurred, Ubisoft confirmed the game's existence while emphasizing that the video was meant strictly for internal demonstration purposes. Videos like this are often made by development teams to show off their ideas. Thus, nothing shown in the video is confirmed to be included in the final game.</p><p style="">In February 2013, shortly before the game was supposed to be released on Wii U Ubisoft delayed the game to September and announced <a href="/playstation-3/3045-35/" data-ref-id="3045-35">PlayStation 3</a> and <a href="/xbox-360/3045-20/" data-ref-id="3045-20">Xbox 360</a> versions to come at the same time. An Ubisoft rep later confirmed that the delay was strictly a business decision to accommodate the added platforms and has nothing to do with development issues since the Wii U version was ready to go. No details have been provided yet how the ports will handle the Wii U-specific features, if they are included at all.</p><p style="">To soften the blow for those who had been anticipating the impending release of the game on Wii U, Ubisoft Montpellier's Micheal Micholic and Michel Ancel appeared in a video on Ubisoft's Facebook page announcing that they would be releasing the games challenge mode exclusively on the Wii U eShop in early April to make up for the delay. The <a href="/rayman-legends-challenges/3030-41651/" data-ref-id="3030-41651">Rayman Legends Challenges App</a> contains the fully featured challenge mode from the main game including online leaderboards, ghost data and Wii U exclusive levels. Initially, the team said they were working on a second demo for the eShop but instead they chose to release the full standalone challenge mode for all Wii U users to download for free.</p><h2>PC

WWII.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Air Conflicts: Pacific Carriers is a semi-realistic flight combat game, focussing on naval battles between the US and Japan during the Second World War. Published a year after the previous title in the franchise, Secret Wars, it contains several significant gameplay changes. The game features Japanese and US singleplayer campaigns, and several multiplayer modes.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">The vast majority of multiplayer modes and the singleplayer campaign focus solely on air combat. The selection of planes can be armed with forward-pointing and directional machineguns, unguided bombs, dive bombs and torpedoes, though no plane can use all types. The game can be played in both ‘arcade’ and ‘simulation’ flight models, though neither is very realistic with the main change being only to the control scheme and whether rudder movement is handled automatically.</p><p style="">The focus on naval warfare means that maps often take place on open water, though islands and coasts do occasionally feature. Planes usually take off and land from aircraft carriers, though this is rarely necessary for the player to do and the lack of realism makes it fairly easy.</p><p style="">All planes have machine guns, which permit a small level of auto-aim but require leading moving targets. Most planes have some kind of other weapon – bombs, torpedoes or rockets – which generally provide no assistance. Torpedoes must be launched from a suitable altitude and speed to avoid being destroyed on impact with the water, as well as considering their speed if aiming a moving target; bombs follow a realistic trajectory, with fighters and torpedo bombers including a specific downward-pointing bombing camera designed to be used in level flight. Planes, both friendly and enemy, do not suffer from damage until destroyed, though random critical hits are possible with the machinegun (hitting the fuel tank, fuel supply or engine, killing the enemy pilot, or hitting the machine gun). Larger objects such as ships or buildings generally require one or more direct impacts from bombs or other explosive weapons to be destroyed.</p><p style="">The game supports a wide range of controls on various platforms, including the Playstation Move.</p><h3>Gameplay comparison to Secret Wars</h3><p style="">Unlike the previous game, the player no longer commands a single plane, but instead controls one of a number in a squad, with the others under AI control. Aircraft no longer have unlimited ammunition, and instead must be rearmed by returning to and landing on a carrier (if available) – usually intended to be done by returning the plane to AI control and letting it rearm. Severely damaged planes will also return to the carrier, but are not available again during that mission. A pilot’s death no longer automatically results in failure, unless all other planes are also destroyed or unavailable. Pilots who survive a mission in singleplayer still gain experience, but skills are improved automatically based on their performance.</p><p style="">Additionally, the randomly-assigned pilot names include a first name of ‘Guillan’ and last name of ‘Derbec’, closely matching a character from the Secret Wars campaign.</p><h3>Singleplayer Campaign Gameplay</h3><p style="">The game includes four campaigns – two from the US perspective (“The Big E”, and “Enterprise vs. Japan”) and two from the Japanese perspective (“Akagi – Red Castle”, and “Zuikaku – Fortunate Crane”). Each side’s campaign cover many of the same events, beginning with the attack on Pearl Harbour and extending past the sinking of the Zuikaku. With the exception of scale (shrinking quantities, distances and times to more manageable and ‘fun’ values) and a few occasions where historical events are assigned to the player’s pilots, the majority of missions correspond to real events and re-enact them realistically. This means that the Japanese campaigns ultimately end in defeat, and other events such as the sinking of the USS Arizona at Pearl Harbor cannot be prevented. The Japanese campaigns include an option for all speech to be in Japanese (with local subtitles), though this is not on by default.</p><p style="">Each campaign has five chapters; each chapter in turn has several missions and a larger-scale battle. The battle must be completed successfully to continue to the next chapter, but other missions are optional and can even be failed or ignored without affecting the main battles (with the exception of any experience gained or pilots lost). Some missions, usually patrols, can in turn reveal other missions – for example, a successful aerial patrol that discovers a nearby submarine may lead to another mission to sink that submarine. The campaigns can only be completed in order, although any completed chapter can be replayed freely.</p><p style="">For most missions, the player is able to select their plane squadron – Fighter, Dive Bomber, or Torpedo Bomber – with the game recommending the most suitable. Each usually then has a range of ammunition options, such as various numbers and weights of unguided bombs, which also affect other factors such as the plane’s top speed. The available weapons vary with the side, squadron and date; for instance, Japanese fighters have a secondary machinegun available, and some planes eventually gain the option of unguided rockets. Some missions require a certain squadron but allow selection of weaponry, and others have sequences using more than one squadron within the same mission. All battles use all three squadrons, though again in sequence and not simultaneously. The number of available planes is set by the mission.</p><p style="">When not playing a mission, the player can set the pilot rosters for each squadron. Each AI pilot has an experience level from 0 to 255 which raises with successful kills and destruction, a skill rating from D to A+ which does not change, and a number of talents assigned based on their actions: Dogfighter, Bomb master, Ship sinker, Tough as nails, Flak dodger, Payload genius, Ejection king, Survivor, Leadership and Lucker.</p><p style="">Pilots shot down in missions – whether human- or AI-controlled – do not necessarily die. Pilots may be listed as KIA (killed in action), MIA (missing in action), or rescued, with the latter making them immediately available. MIA pilots have a chance of being found in later missions and can be directly found in some patrol missions, and new unassigned pilots (with random skill and no experience) are provided constantly through the game. Unavailable pilots are replaced with new pilots from the aircraft carrier automatically.</p><p style="">Typical objectives during missions and battles are:</p><ul><li>· Protect air/ground targets</li><li>· Attack air/ground targets</li><li>· Search for enemies from the air</li><li>· Search for enemies from a ship watchtower</li><li>· Defend ship with anti-aircraft gun</li></ul><p style="">The latter objective, which occurs only when a watchtower patrol spots incoming enemy bombers, is the only time in the singleplayer campaign when the player controls something other than a plane. The AA gun is a static but rotatable device with unlimited ammunition.</p><h4>Alpha Squadron – Fighters</h4><p style="">Fighter planes are used primarily for attacking other air targets or small raids; they have the fastest speeds but can only carry a small complement of bombs. Japanese fighters have both the default and a secondary more powerful machinegun alongside any other weapons, which is not available to the US fighters.</p><h4>Beta Squadron – Dive Bombers</h4><p style="">Dive bombers are used somewhat interchangeably with the torpedo bombers. Slower than the fighters, they are able to carry more bombs. The damage from a dive bomb is related to the speed and angle at which it hits the target, as in real life.</p><h4>Charlie Squadron – Torpedo Bombers</h4><p style="">The only plane able to carry torpedoes, it is often the slowest, though this is solely due to the limitations of launching torpedoes and their weight than the plane itself. Armaments only permit one torpedo per plane, with an alternative of one or more bombs, including a single bomb the same size as the torpedo which can be used on land targets or at higher speeds and altitudes.</p><h4>Other Aircraft</h4><p style="">Occasionally the player is given temporary control of planes that are not part of the carrier squadrons – usually long-range bombers. These identify the pilot as “not from carrier”, and cannot be rearmed or reused after returning to AI control.</p><h3>Other singleplayer modes</h3><h4>Survive Mode</h4><p style="">An endless version of the AA defence objective, with the player controlling AA guns on several ships (able to switch between them) and defending from waves of bombing raids.</p><h4>Dogfight</h4><p style="">A quick match versus a number of AI aircraft or ships.</p><h3>Multiplayer</h3><p style="">The multiplayer includes modes for deathmatch, team deathmatch, a variant of capture-the-flag, and ‘carrier battle’ which involves planes defending their team’s carrier from damage while attempting to sink the opponent’s carrier.</p><h3>Included aircraft, ships and other vehicles</h3><h4>Campaign aircraft</h4><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td><p style="">A6M Zero</p></td><td><p style="">Fighter</p></td><td><p style="">582 kph</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style="">D3A Val</p></td><td><p style="">Fighter</p></td><td><p style="">350 kph</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style="">TBF Avenger</p></td><td><p style="">Torpedo bomber</p></td><td><p style="">405 kph</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style="">F4U</p></td><td><p style="">Fighter</p></td><td><p style="">540 kph</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style="">B5N Kate</p></td><td><p style="">Torpedo bomber</p></td><td><p style="">312 kph</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style="">P40 Warhawk</p></td><td><p style="">Fighter</p></td><td><p style="">550 kph</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style="">SBD</p></td><td><p style="">Dive bomber</p></td><td><p style="">315 kph</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style="">F4F</p></td><td><p style="">Fighter</p></td><td><p style="">400 kph</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style="">B-25 Mitchel</p></td><td><p style="">Medium bomber</p></td><td><p style="">220 kph</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style="">TBD Devastator</p></td><td><p style="">Torpedo bomber</p></td><td><p style="">260 kph</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style="">F6F</p></td><td><p style="">Fighter</p></td><td><p style="">515 kph</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h4> Other aircraft</h4><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td><p style="">Ki-45 Toryu</p></td><td><p style="">Heavy fighter</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style="">Sea Hurricane</p></td><td><p style="">Fighter</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style="">Seafire</p></td><td><p style="">Fighter</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style="">B6N Tenzan</p></td><td><p style="">Torpedo bomber</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style="">D4Y Suisei</p></td><td><p style="">Dive bomber</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style="">B7A Ryusei</p></td><td><p style="">Dive bomber / torpedo bomber</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style="">Ki-43 Hayabusa</p></td><td><p style="">Fighter</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style="">Messershmitt Bf 109</p></td><td><p style="">Fighter</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style="">Stuka Ju 87</p></td><td><p style="">Dive bomber</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h4> Ships and miscellaneous vehicles</h4><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td><p style="">US/Ally Ships</p></td><td><p style="">Japanese Ships</p></td><td><p style="">Other vehicles</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style="">HMS Dorsetshire</p><p style="">USS Arizona</p><p style="">USS Enterprise</p><p style="">USS Hornet</p><p style="">USS Lexington</p><p style="">USS Princeton</p><p style="">USS West Virginia</p><p style="">USS Yorktown</p><p style=""> </p><p style="">Atlanta class cruiser</p><p style="">Colorado class battleship</p><p style="">Fletcher class destroyer</p><p style="">Independence light carrier</p><p style="">Liberty cargo ship</p><p style="">Mahan class destroyer</p><p style="">New Orleans cruiser</p><p style="">North Carolina battleship</p><p style="">Pennsylvania class battleship</p><p style="">Porpoise class submarine</p><p style="">Yorktown class carrier</p><p style=""> </p></td><td><p style="">Akagi</p><p style="">Hiei</p><p style="">Hiryu</p><p style="">Kaga</p><p style="">Kamikawa</p><p style="">Maru</p><p style="">Ryūjō</p><p style="">Shokaku</p><p style="">Soryu</p><p style="">Yamato</p><p style="">Zuihō</p><p style=""> </p><p style="">Agano class cruiser</p><p style="">Akagi carrier</p><p style="">Cimarron class Oiler</p><p style="">Kaiyo escort carrier</p><p style="">Kamikaze class destroyer</p><p style="">Kongo class battleship</p><p style="">Myoko class cruiser</p><p style="">Shiratsuyu class destroyer</p><p style="">Shiriya oiler</p><p style="">Shokaku class carrier</p><p style="">Submarine type I-21</p><p style=""> </p></td><td><p style="">GMC Truck</p><p style="">Howitzer</p><p style="">Sherman Tank</p><p style="">Type 97 Tank</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Singleplayer Campaign Synopsis</h2><p style="">The mission/battle synopses relate to events as depicted in the game and are not necessarily historically accurate, but where possible Wikipedia links to the real events are provided.</p><p style="">Battles are listed first in each chapter, and missions are not necessarily in chronological order.</p><p style="">Both US campaigns focus on the USS Enterprise (CV-6), or rather the plane squadrons launched from it; each Japanese campaign focusses on a different carrier (the Akagi and the Zuikaku).</p><h3>The Big E</h3><h4>Chapter 1: Pearl Harbor</h4><p style=""><strong>Attack on Pearl Harbor (Battle)</strong></p><p style="">Bravo Squadron happens to be patrolling in range of Pearl Harbour when the attack begins, and is the first to arrive, shooting down enemy planes and protecting allied P40 fighters that are taking off. Alpha Squadron arrives and attempts to protect USS Arizona, ultimately failing, then attempting to protect Ford island from further incoming enemy bombers.</p><p style="">More information: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">Attack on Pearl Harbor</a></p><p style=""><strong>Airborne Patrol</strong></p><p style="">A squadron is sent out to search for signs of the enemy, ultimately finding and sinking two enemy submarines.</p><p style=""><strong>Watchtower Patrol</strong></p><p style="">The watchtower spots two enemy patrol aircraft, which are shot down as they attempt to escape.</p><p style="">Chapter 2: Marshall Islands</p><p style=""><strong>Maloelap Atoll Raid (Battle)</strong></p><p style="">The Marshall Islands are of strategic value to both sides, particularly for their use in supply lines. In the wake of the Pearl Harbour raid the Enterprise shows her capability to fight back. Once fighters have eliminated the aerial defences, dive bombers target hangars and other airfield targets, and torpedo bombers sink several cargo ships.</p><p style="">More information: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maloelap#History" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">Maloelap History</a></p><p style=""><strong>Wotje Atoll Raid</strong></p><p style="">Wotje Atoll houses a heavily-fortified Japanese seaplane base. The aim of Enterprise’s raid is to disrupt it, not dislodge the Japanese – merely to keep the base destabilised until a better opportunity arises. Planes from the Enterprise eliminate the enemy aircraft and then attack enemy artillery and fuel tanks.</p><p style="">More information: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshalls%E2%80%93Gilberts_raids" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">Marshalls-Gilberts Raids</a></p><p style=""><strong>Watchtower Patrol</strong></p><p style="">A bombing raid is spotted. For unknown reasons the plane appears to malfunction and plunges towards the Enterprise, but is shot down. The deliberate suicide is not recognised.</p><h4>Chapter 3: Wake Islands</h4><p style=""><strong>Battle of Wake Island (Battle)</strong></p><p style="">In November of the previous year, American military personnel were transported to Wake Island on the USS Enterprise. In December, after Pearl Harbour, the island was captured by the Japanese, with the personnel killed or taken prisoner. Enterprise’s squadrons destroy enemy planes and hangars, eliminate AA emplacements, and then kill prison personnel &amp; vehicles. Enterprise liberates Wake Island and rescues the American troops.</p><p style="">More information: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Wake_Island#Japanese_occupation" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">Battle of Wake Island</a></p><p style=""><strong>Airborne Patrol</strong></p><p style="">During a routine patrol, a US submarine is located while attempting to sink a Japanese cargo convoy.

B-25 bombers launched from the USS Hornet destroy ground targets, supported by pilots from the USS Enterprise. Each bomber only has time and fuel for one pass before heading to a landing site in China, as the Hornet is too small for them to land on. Several nearby patrol boats are also destroyed to prevent early warning.</p><p style="">More information: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doolittle_Raid" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">Doolittle Raid</a></p><p style=""><strong>Watchtower Patrol</strong></p><p style="">The watchtower spots patrol boats at a safe distance.</p><h4>Chapter 5: Coral Sea</h4><p style=""><strong>Battle of Coral Sea (Battle)</strong></p><p style="">In the first carrier-on-carrier battle, though there are losses on both sides, it is a strategic victory for the Allies. Torpedo bombers sink the Zuikaku and dive bombers sink the Shokaku, and the Enterprise is successfully defended, but the USS Lexington is scuttled.</p><p style="">More information: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Coral_Sea" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">Battle of the Coral Sea</a></p><p style=""><strong>Attack Tulagi Island</strong></p><p style="">The Island of Tulagi, taken from the Allies in May, is disrupted by an attack from Enterprise pilots.

Codebreakers know about a Japanese trap to remove the US forces. Hornet and Yorktown are present, though the latter is damaged. Japanese carriers Akagi and Kaga are sunk, and their remaining aircrew, with nowhere to land, attempt kamikaze attacks on the USS Enterprise. At the end of the battle then Yorktown and Soryu have also been sunk, the Hornet’s aircrew lost, and Hiryu retreats.</p><p style="">More information: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Midway" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">Battle of Midway</a></p><p style=""><strong>Defend Midway</strong></p><p style="">With the Midway airfields under attack, Enterprise provides support until allied planes can take off; the fight is then left to the local aircraft who eventually succeed.</p><p style="">More information: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Midway#Initial_air_attacks" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">Battle of Midway (Initial air attacks)</a></p><p style=""><strong>Last Carrier</strong></p><p style="">Enterprise planes search among the retreating Japanese forces for Hiryu, the sole carrier to escape the Battle of Midway.

Against ‘tremendous’ odds the Enterprise survives an attack from enemy carriers, though damage to its deck temporarily makes it impossible for damaged planes to land. Neither side scores a decisive victory.</p><p style="">More information: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Eastern_Solomons" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">Battle of the Eastern Solomons</a></p><p style=""><strong>Tulagi Landings</strong></p><p style="">With Tulagi a vital location for both sides, the Enterprise defends landing craft as they approach the land and then support the allied invasion force.</p><p style="">More information: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Tulagi_and_Gavutu-Tanambogo#Tulagi" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">Battle of Tulagi and Gavutu-Tanan</a>, though it has no reference to allied air support.</p><p style=""><strong>Airborne Patrol</strong></p><p style="">A routine patrol unexpectedly comes across the Zuikaku and Shokaku.

Once resisted, the biggest threat becomes the battleship Hiei, with prodigious AA defences. Enterprise planes distract it until B-25 bombers can take off from the now-safe Henderson Field and destroy it from a safe distance with torpedoes and high altitude dive bombing.</p><p style="">More information: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_battleship_Hiei#1942:_Combat_and_loss" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">Hiei</a>, which has little in common with the events depicted in-game</p><p style=""><strong>Night Naval Battle</strong></p><p style="">The first mission in game to take place at night, the Deputy Commander of the Air Group from the USS Yorktown has devised a technique to navigate at night. A single plane is sent as a test to take out enemy searchlights. It succeeds in blinding several ships including the Hiei, at least until dawn.</p><p style=""><strong>Watchtower Patrol</strong></p><p style="">An enemy submarine is spotted. Before any action can be taken, it torpedoes and sinks the USS Juneau.</p><p style="">More information: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Juneau_(CL-52)#Naval_Battle_of_Guadalcanal" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">USS Juneau (CL-52)</a></p><p style=""><strong>Eliminate Submarine</strong></p><p style="">A force is launched after the sinking of the USS Juneau to destroy the submarine before it can submerge.

The Japanese stage a suicide attack on the ship regardless and manage to sink it, though the planes do achieve some level of revenge by preventing the escape of the enemy bombers. The Enterprise then comes under attack and is forced to defend itself with torpedo bombers (armed with rockets instead of torpedoes). With one enemy bomber left and all aircraft out of ammunition the Command of the Air Group gives his life by ramming it to save the Enterprise.</p><p style="">More information: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Rennell_Island#Action_on_30_January" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">Battle of Rennell Island</a></p><p style=""><strong>Watchtower Patrol</strong></p><p style="">A fleet of enemy cruisers is detected.

Once they arrive, they devastate the area – attacking the USS West Virginia, bombing enemy hangars, destroying planes on the ground, eliminating pilots heading to the airfields, eliminating incoming enemy planes and destroying the USS Arizona. With the declaration of war after the surprise attack, the Japanese now plan to drive the US forces from the pacific entirely.</p><p style="">More information: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor#First_wave_composition" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">Attack on Pearl Harbour</a></p><p style=""><strong>Airborne Patrol</strong></p><p style="">As Akagi moves away from Hawaii, it encounters a lone enemy submarine – either confused or unaware of the recent events. The submarine is sunk.</p><h4>Chapter 2: Rabaul</h4><p style=""><strong>Battle of Rabaul (Battle)</strong></p><p style="">Rabaul is the main port of ‘New Britain’, north-west of the Solomon Islands. Only lightly defended, Japanese aircraft eliminate local air defences, and then attack Australian artillery and retreating Australian forces, resulting in the capture of Rabaul for the establishment of an airbase.</p><p style="">More information: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Rabaul_(1942)#Battle" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">Battle of Rabaul (1942)</a></p><p style=""><strong>Airborne Patrol</strong></p><p style="">A patrol discovers a Japanese supply convoy under attack from British fighter planes, which are quickly defeated.</p><p style=""><strong>Capture Rabaul</strong></p><p style="">Aircraft search Rabaul for any remaining Australian units, and dispose of them. With the island clear, the construction of the airbase can begin. A large number of Australian soldiers are also taken prisoner.</p><h4>Chapter 3: Darwin</h4><p style=""><strong>Bombing of Darwin (Battle)</strong></p><p style="">In a bombing raid considered as successful as the operation on Hawaii, Australian forces in the area are neutralised. Three warships in Darwin Harbour are sunk, enemy fighters are destroyed before they can take off, remaining fighters and a British ace are killed, and finally the airfields are bombed. The Japanese, believing the Australians will no longer be a factor in the pacific, plan to next target British forces in the Indian Ocean.</p><p style="">More information: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Darwin#Air_raids" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">Bombing of Darwin</a></p><p style=""><strong>Airborne Patrol</strong></p><p style="">Two planes from the Akagi are sent with photographers to document the results of the bombing.

With Japanese codes cracked by the US their plans were revealed, and the Zuikaku and Shokaku being repaired elsewhere, and too many pilots sent to attack American ships, there was little hope. It is a significant failure for the Japanese, losing not only Akagi but Hiryu, Soryu and Kaga. With nowhere to land, the pilots perform kamikaze attacks on the USS Yorktown and Enterprise, succeeding in sinking only the former.</p><p style="">More information: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_aircraft_carrier_Akagi#Sinking" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">Akagi</a></p><p style=""><strong>Attack Midway</strong></p><p style="">Planes are sent to Midway, intended as a feint to draw other forces into a trap, but the damage they cause is still of benefit.

Torpedo bombers are escorted to the Enterprise in yet another attempt to sink it, but fail to inflict enough damage. Shokaku is attacked with torpedoes, and sunk, leaving Zuikaku as the sole Japanese carrier alive that took part in the Hawaii operation. Though an enemy light carrier and submarines are destroyed, they are not equal to the Shokaku.

The remaining crew are now expected to sacrifice themselves if necessary; kamikaze attacks result in the sinking of several light carriers, with the fighter squadron protecting the Zuikaku only so it can fight as long as possible. The Chiyoda and Zuihō are lost, and finally the Zuikaku itself is sunk, effectively ending the American-Japanese pacific naval war.</p><p style="">More information: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_aircraft_carrier_Zuikaku#Battle_of_Cape_Enga.C3.B1o" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">Zuikaku</a></p><p style=""><strong>Attack US Fleet</strong></p><p style="">The Island of Leyte is vital for oil supply, and if the US capture it Japanese access to fuel will be severely restricted.

The game is available digitally for PC and physical copies can sometimes be obtained via the game's website. The game is highly reminiscent of Capcom's <a href="/street-fighter-iii-3rd-strike/3030-1615/" data-ref-id="3030-1615">Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike</a>, having had its development heavily advised upon by several high-profile Japanese 3rd Strike players.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6685/2197225-7hjk9.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2197225" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6685/2197225-7hjk9.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2197225"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6685/2197225-7hjk9.jpg"></a><figcaption>Versus screen featuring Shimo and Chadha.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The game features a six-button control layout and assigns two of these buttons to high and low <a href="/parrying/3015-2485/" data-ref-id="3015-2485">parry</a>. Much like the Capcom games it is influenced by, Yatagarasu also features special moves, normal move <a href="/animation-canceling/3015-1568/" data-ref-id="3015-1568">cancels</a>, super moves, super move cancels, and long, damaging <a href="/combo/3015-18/" data-ref-id="3015-18">combos</a>.The game's animation style is also heavily influenced by Capcom's later 2D fighters, and features lavishly animated 2D sprite work, although the number of characters in Yatagarasu is considerably lower than any of those games.</p><p style="">One notable feature of Yatagarasu is the ability to unlock match commentary by famed Japanese 3rd Strike players and commentators such as Tokido, KSK, and Kokujin. These announcer voices are unlocked via the game's arcade mode and replace the game's default announcer voice with each player's unique, boisterous Japanese match commentary.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">Yatagarasu's gameplay can be described as deliberate compared to the games it is influenced by, with an emphasis on spacing and proper use each character's normal moves. Every normal move in the game is super cancellable, which can lead to extreme amounts of damage being dealt at mid-range via option selecting supers behind each poke. Throws are performed with light punch and light kick, and feature a whiff animation. Parrying is unique in that because it is mapped to a set of buttons, parries can be performed from crouch block at little risk; this can make predictable attacks very risky but also creates opportunities to throw opponents who fish for parries. The game also features universal overhead attacks that are performed in the same manner as those found in the Street Fighter III series.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>38196</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/0/6685/2197228-zfj6j.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/6685/2197228-zfj6j.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/0/6685/2197228-zfj6j.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6685/2197228-zfj6j.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/6685/2197228-zfj6j.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/6685/2197228-zfj6j.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/0/6685/2197228-zfj6j.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Yatagarasu]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating/><original_release_date>2011-08-13 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-143/]]></api_detail_url><id>143</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation Network (Vita)]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-network-vita/3045-143/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PSNV]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-145/]]></api_detail_url><id>145</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox One]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-one/3045-145/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[XONE]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/]]></api_detail_url><id>146</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 4]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS4]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/yatagarasu/3030-38196/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[Elder Scrolls: Online

The game begins with Katie arriving home after traveling abroad to discover an empty home. The player finds various clues left from family members, such as letters, diary tape recordings, and maps leading to secret areas, in order to learn more about Sam's story. The game rarely tells the player where to look for the next relevant clue. This requires the player to scavenge the house for clues that will connect the dots to discovering more of the narrative. Access to certain parts of the house are gated using locked doors and require matching keys to be found before progressing.</p><p style="">There is no combat or difficult puzzles. The player progresses through the story by finding clues that lead them to discovering the next piece of the narrative, eventually leading to the game's ending. Most small objects can be picked up and examined from any angle. Additionally, finding certain notes will activate voice over narration from Sam that plays automatically and can be listened to again from the inventory screen. This is similar to how audio logs function in games such as <a href="/bioshock/3030-17280/" data-ref-id="3030-17280">BioShock</a><em>. </em></p><h2>Development</h2><p style="">The development of Gone Home was led by <a href="/steven-gaynor/3040-98001/" data-ref-id="3040-98001">Steve Gaynor</a>. In May 2012, he appeared in a Giant Bomb <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/videos/fullbright-clear-eyes-cant-lose/2300-5974/" data-ref-id="2300-5974">video interview</a> to discuss the founding of The Fullbright Company and the early development of Gone Home.

If you're hit by the words, you lose all of your kick factor meter, which will also knock you out of kick factor.

The angle of the divekick itself is manually chosen by the player, pressing kick straight after dive results in a complete vertical divekick, while holding the kick button rotates The Baz to varying angles. The maximum is a 90 degrees angle, resulting in a complete Horizontal divekick. At 3 seconds, The Baz has the shortest Kick Factor in the game. Like Jefailey he also doesn't get any traditional bonuses. Instead, for those 3 seconds The Baz emits electricity, knocking out any who touch him.

The longer dive and kick are held down for, the longer the Mighty Swing, resulting in longer loops. It can also be cancelled into more Mighty Swings and divekicks. The <a href="http://store.tcgplayer.com/Products.aspx?GameName=Magic&amp;Name=Shocker&amp;partner=AUTOANY" rel="nofollow">Shocker</a> is The Baz's ground special that, like his Kick Factor activation, serves as an unconventional means to KO an opponent.

Doing so, activates Upkick mode making MarkMan the only character with a shoryuken/dragon punch anti-air move. If MarkMan is unsuccessful in picking up either the kickbox, the yellow button or the blue button he will instead pick up one of five random throw-away items. Both the positive and negative effects of these items can affect MarkMan and his opponent.

It introduces new elements to the franchise, such as co-op gameplay and decision-making as well as a more interactive world.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Divinity: Original Sin was released on June, 30th 2014 on PC and Mac. An enhanced edition of the game, which includes additional story bits and new gameplay options is currently is released on PC, PS4 and Xbox One. This version (even on consoles) is free to players that already bought the original PC version.</p><p style="">The game was Kickstarter funded.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">The game allows players to control a party, which initially consists of two characters:</p><ul><li>A woman who has recently been resurrected</li><li>A condemned warrior who has suffered years of agony and torture</li></ul><p style="">Additional characters can later be recruited in the game world itself (there are four story-specific pre-made characters in the game currently) or in the game's hub world. Characters recruited in the hub world can be further customized to perfectly fit the player's party needs.</p><p style="">During the course of the game, players will either control the characters independently in the single player mode or have separate players controlling separate characters in multiplayer co-op. Along with multiplayer co-op control, a co-op dialogue decision system (using a stone/paper/scissors mini-game based on player stats, much like that found in Star Wars: The Old Republic) will allow both players the ability to make decisions within the game's world.</p><p style="">Almost everything can be directly interacted with, while some objects can offer bonuses. One example is that a mushroom on the ground can be picked up and applied to your weapon in order to give it a few stacks of a poison damage buff.</p><p style="">The game also features a magic system that allows players to take advantage of reactive spells. As an example, if a player casts an ice spell and it freezes something, the player can then cast fire and it will cause the ice to melt. After that, the player could cast a lightning spell and it will electrocute the enemy in the melted ice water.</p><p style="">Divinity: Original Sin shipped with a full level editor using many of the same tools that Larian has used to make the Divinity games in recent years, and any adventures/areas/etc will be made available through direct interface built into the game for players to download and use. The world itself is far more interactive than any previous iteration of the games.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style="">The game follows two characters, a man and a woman, who are part of an organization called the Source Hunters, which is tasked with eradicating the dangerous magic known as The Source and everyone that's trying to wield or control it.</p><p style="">They soon uncover a conspiracy by The Immaculates, a hidden cult, that has been mining and monopolizing the dangerous mineral Tenebrium for yet unknown reasons. The cult is led by a being called The Conduit which is in command of immortal and indestructible warriors known as Death Knights.</p><p style="">Along the way the Source Hunters can recruit Madora, a female knight that despises all magic; Jahan, a wizard that paradoxically hates most forms of magic; Bairdotr, a ranger that was raised by a bear and Wolgraff, a rouge who is mute because sorcerers stole his voice when he was younger.</p><p style="">Eventually the party comes across magical crystals strewn all over the world known as Star Stones. Upon finding the first crystal they immediately get transported to a place that exists outside of known spacetime called The Homestead.</p><p style="">It is here they meet an imp historian, Zixzax, who has been ordered by the gods to record everything that has ever happened until the end of time. From him, and by collecting more and more Star Stones, the party learns the secrets behind the Immaculates, The Death Knights, their own past and the universe ending threat that looms over everything, known as The Void.</p><p style="">Thus they embark on a quest to stop the Immaculates and hinder The Void from destroying all of creation.</p><h2>Kickstarter Campaign</h2><p style="">The game's Kickstarter campaign was very successful, garnering over $940,000 against a $400,000 goal.</p><h2>System Requirements</h2><h3><strong>Windows</strong></h3><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col"><strong>Minimum</strong></th><th scope="col"><strong>Recommended</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="1"><strong>OS</strong>: Windows XP SP3 or higher</td><td colspan="1"><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8.1</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel Core2 Duo E6600 or equivalent</td><td colspan="1"><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel i5 2400 or higher</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><strong>Memory</strong>: 2048 MB RAM</td><td colspan="1"><strong>Memory</strong>: 4096 MB RAM</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><strong>GPU</strong>: HD Intel Graphics 4000 or NVIDIA® GeForce® 8800 GT (512 MB) or ATI™ Radeon™ HD 4850 or equivalent</td><td colspan="1"><strong>GPU</strong>: NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 550 ti 1GB ram or or ATI™ Radeon™ HD 6XXX or higher</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 9.0c</td><td colspan="1"><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 9.0c</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><strong>Hard Drive</strong>: 10 GB available space</td><td colspan="1"><strong>Hard Drive</strong>: 10 GB available space</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><strong>Sound Card</strong>: DirectX9c compliant</td><td colspan="1"><strong>Sound Card</strong>: DirectX9c compliant</td></tr></tbody></table><h3><strong>Mac</strong></h3><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col"><strong>Minimum</strong></th><th scope="col"><strong>Recommended</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="1"><strong>OS</strong>: OS X 10.8.5</td><td colspan="1"><strong>OS</strong>: OS X 10.9.3</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel Core 2 Duo</td><td colspan="1"><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel i5 or higher</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><strong>Memory</strong>: 4 GB RAM</td><td colspan="1"><strong>Memory</strong>: 4 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><strong>GPU</strong>: Intel HD Graphics 3000/4000</td><td colspan="1"><strong>GPU</strong>: Intel Iris (Iris Pro) or ATI™ Radeon™ HD 6XXX or higher or NVidia 6xx series or higher</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><strong>Hard Drive</strong>: 10 GB available space</td><td colspan="1"><strong>Hard Drive</strong>: 10 GB available space</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><strong>Additional Notes</strong>: HD3000 &amp;

This feature allows for the characters to perform maneuvers involving objects within the stage. However, different characters use the same environmental objects in different ways. A character with super strength like <a href="/solomon-grundy/3005-10165/" data-ref-id="3005-10165">Solomon Grundy</a> may pick up a car and smash an opponent with it, but someone like <a href="/batman/3005-66/" data-ref-id="3005-66">Batman</a> would be unable to do so, and would instead smash his opponent's face into the hood of the car. There are three main attack buttons (light, medium, strong) and one "gimmick" button that performs character-specific tasks. For <a href="/wonder-woman/3005-2301/" data-ref-id="3005-2301">Wonder Woman</a>, it performs a stance change between sword/shield and lasso. For <a href="/superman/3005-47/" data-ref-id="3005-47">Superman</a> it burns a bit of meter to enhance damage for a set period of time.</p><p style="">Additionally, stage transitions return from <a href="/mortal-kombat-vs-dc-universe/3030-20449/" data-ref-id="3030-20449">Mortal Kombat vs DC Universe</a>, allowing players to move throughout various parts of each arena over the course of the fight. The game is expected to receive a T rating and will not feature <a href="/fatality/3015-10/" data-ref-id="3015-10">Fatalities</a>, but instead, elaborate and over-the-top <a href="/super-combo/3015-6149/" data-ref-id="3015-6149">super moves</a> such as punching an opponent into <a href="/space/3035-50/" data-ref-id="3035-50">space</a>, with the in-universe explanation that the less superhuman characters are surviving their injuries thanks to a medicine that allows human characters like Batman and Green Arrow to go toe-to-toe with metahuman characters like Black Adam and Solomon Grundy.

Additionally, Joker had attuned a nuclear bomb to Lois' pulse, and when she died, the WMD detonated, destroying the city of <a href="/metropolis/3035-114/" data-ref-id="3035-114">Metropolis</a>. Despite <a href="/batman/3005-66/" data-ref-id="3005-66">Batman</a>'s efforts to calm him down, an enraged Superman murdered the Joker with his bare hands, and subsequently took it upon himself to forcibly subdue all the governments of the world, unifying them into his <a href="/one-earth-regime/3015-8018/" data-ref-id="3015-8018">One Earth Regime</a>, believing that the only way to protect mankind from themselves was to control them utterly. The Regime then sets out to kill every metahuman, hero <em>or </em>villain, who stands in their way, with many heroes and villains choosing to join the Regime out of fear or misplaced respect.</p><p style="">Superman rules with an iron fist, using his massive army to keep the planet in line, and to prevent crime no matter what the cost. Only Batman and his <a href="/insurgency/3015-8022/" data-ref-id="3015-8022">Insurgency</a>, a group of rebels comprised mainly of reformed supervillains, dare to stand against this new Regime in the hopes of freeing Earth from the rule of the Man of Steel.The game properly begins five years later, in our universe, where a huge force of supervillains are waging an attack against the Justice League. While investigating <a href="/arkham-asylum/3035-1236/" data-ref-id="3035-1236">Arkham Asylum</a> to see if they freed the Joker for the attack, Batman is attacked by <a href="/deathstroke/3005-7440/" data-ref-id="3005-7440">Deathstroke</a>, whom he subsequently defeats in combat, before teleporting to the Watchtower, the Justice League's orbital headquarters, where he saves <a href="/nightwing/3005-8204/" data-ref-id="3005-8204">Nightwing </a>and <a href="/cyborg/3005-8268/" data-ref-id="3005-8268">Cyborg </a>from <a href="/bane/3005-6674/" data-ref-id="3005-6674">Bane</a> and <a href="/lex-luthor/3005-6225/" data-ref-id="3005-6225">Lex Luthor</a>, who is overcome despite an impressive suit of powered armour. Just as the coordinated efforts of the entire League seem to have overcome the villainous attack, a new alert is sounded as the Joker and <a href="/harley-quinn/3005-2979/" data-ref-id="3005-2979">Harley Quinn</a> have been spotted in Metropolis, setting up a nuclear weapon. Several members of the Justice League converge on the site as the Joker sets the bomb to standby, but before it can be detonated, Batman, the Joker, <a href="/wonder-woman/3005-2301/" data-ref-id="3005-2301">Wonder Woman</a>, <a href="/green-lantern/3005-2292/" data-ref-id="3005-2292">Green Lantern</a>, <a href="/green-arrow/3005-2296/" data-ref-id="3005-2296">Green Arrow</a>, and <a href="/aquaman/3005-2321/" data-ref-id="3005-2321">Aquaman</a> all vanish in a burst of light.</p><p style="">Batman and the Joker find themselves in the alternate reality's version of Metropolis, where the Joker attacks the Dark Knight and is easily defeated, but before Batman can even catch his breath, they are immediately surrounded by soldiers of the Regime. Batman is forced to use his gadgets to escape, which allows Joker to slip away on his own in the confusion. Listening in on the military's radio chatter, Batman is horrified to learn about the tyrannical One Earth government. Meanwhile, the other heroes who vanished find themselves in <a href="/gotham-city/3035-111/" data-ref-id="3035-111">Gotham City</a>, trying to figure out what happened and how they got there. Not yet realizing they are in an alternate universe, and looking for answers, Green Arrow and Wonder Woman quietly explore Gotham, while Aquaman heads to the kingdom of <a href="/atlantis/3035-399/" data-ref-id="3035-399">Atlantis</a>. Meanwhile, Green Lantern heads to the headquarters of Ferris Aircraft, inc. in Coast City, where he keeps his Green Lantern Battery in our world.</p><p style="">When he arrives, he realizes that things are different here, and stumbles across the alternate versions of Cyborg and <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/raven/3005-8266/" data-ref-id="3005-8266">Raven</a>, who became bitter and twisted after the deaths of the other members of the Teen Titans, and joined Superman's Regime as two of his top enforcers. Additionally, Raven has embraced her demonic heritage, and Green Lantern comes across her using evil magic to torture their version of Deathstroke, who is a member of the Insurgency. Preventing them from killing Slade, Green Lantern is forced to fight the fallen heroes, but before he can get answers from a not-terribly-grateful Deathstroke, Hal is contacted by Wonder Woman, saying she and Green Arrow are being attacked by Green Lantern's archenemy <a href="/sinestro/3005-6693/" data-ref-id="3005-6693">Sinestro</a> back in Gotham City. Upon returning, Green Lantern finally learns explicit details of the Regime as Sinestro brags that it's similar to the government he imposed over his own homeworld of Korugar. Sinestro also reveals that the Green Arrow of this universe was killed for siding with the Insurgents, and that Green Lantern's counterpart actually sided with the Regime, and works alongside Sinestro. Green Lantern manages to defeat Sinestro, only to be shocked by the arrival of said counterpart, and the revelation that this universe's version of Hal Jordan has abandoned the <a href="/green-lantern-corps/3015-7593/" data-ref-id="3015-7593">Green Lantern Corps.</a> and joined the <a href="/sinestro-corps/3015-7595/" data-ref-id="3015-7595">Sinestro Corps.</a>, being known to the people of Earth as Yellow Lantern.</p><p style="">The Green and Yellow Lanterns do battle, with our Hal Jordan being the victor, and after he, Wonder Woman, and Green Arrow are forced to flee from incoming soldiers, they run into the alternate Batman. Meanwhile, back in our universe, an anxious Superman checks in with <a href="/flash/3005-541/" data-ref-id="3005-541">the Flash</a> and Cyborg, who are trying to trace the signal and find out where the missing heroes went.In Atlantis, Aquaman pretends to be his counterpart in order to gain access to the Atlantean archives and learn more about this world.</p><p style="">After discovering the origins of the Regime, an aide informs him that envoys from Superman have arrived, and Aquaman greets the alternate versions of <a href="/shazam/3005-4576/" data-ref-id="3005-4576">Captain Marvel</a> and the Flash, who have brought a treaty to be signed formalizing an alliance between Atlantis and the Regime. However, Aquaman is unable to keep up the charade after realizing that his counterpart was willing to sign an agreement which would have subjugated Atlantis to the Regime, allowing Superman to control their armies and dictate their laws. After attacking and defeating the envoys, Aquaman is then confronted by his own counterpart, who orders his soldiers to capture 'the imposter'.</p><p style="">Aquaman easily fights them off before managing to defeat his own counterpart, but the armies of Atlantis are vast. However, before he could be overwhelmed, time freezes in place, and our Aquaman is confronted by the Greek god <a href="/ares/3005-10151/" data-ref-id="3005-10151">Ares</a>, who was drawn to Atlantis by the conflict, which he feeds on to charge his magical powers. Before Ares can explain himself, Aquaman attacks, and actually manages to defeat the god in a one-on-one fight, after which the god of war reveals that he is the weakest he's ever been, since Superman's Regime has virtually eliminated conflict throughout the world, and he actually wants to help Aquaman escape from Atlantis, since the heroes from our universe are creating the most interesting conflict this world has seen in five years. He then uses his magical powers to reunite Aquaman with his friends, teleporting him to safety at the secret headquarters of the Insurgency. There, the alternate Batman reveals the Insurgency's greatest weapon, a pill that temporarily grants normal human beings the superhuman durability necessary to go toe-to-toe with metahuman opponents.</p><p style="">Batman then introduces his greatest ally, the alternate Lex Luthor, who was never a villain to begin with in this universe, and in fact pretends to be a close friend of Superman's, while secretly funding and aiding the Insurgents. Then, Batman reveals the reason he brought the heroes to his world; years ago he created a <a href="/kryptonite/3055-1216/" data-ref-id="3055-1216">kryptonite</a>-based laser weapon that would kill Superman, should the hero ever go rogue, but it's sealed in the abandoned Batcave behind a lock that required the agreement of four other founding members of the Justice League in order to open. Those four members were Wonder Woman, Green Arrow, Green Lantern, and Aquaman, but his world's Green Arrow died fighting the Regime, and the alternate versions of the other three heroes all sided with Superman, so Batman called upon the equivalents from our world, as their DNA would be identical.Meanwhile, the alternate Superman oversees the brainwashing and mind control of the monster Doomsday, while the alternate Wonder Woman, whom he is in a romantic relationship with, checks in on him, before they are interrupted by Yellow Lantern, who informs them of the existence of the 'duplicate' heroes from our world.</p><h2>Characters</h2><p style="">The game includes 24 playable characters, split up in the character select screen into heroes (left side) and villains (right side).</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Playable Heroes</th><th scope="col">Voice Actors</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="//www.giantbomb.com/aquaman/3005-2321/" data-ref-id="3005-2321">Aquaman</a></td><td><a href="//www.giantbomb.com/phil-lamarr/3040-89594/" data-ref-id="3040-89594">Phil LaMarr</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href="//www.giantbomb.com/batman/3005-66/" data-ref-id="3005-66">Batman</a></td><td><a href="//www.giantbomb.com/kevin-conroy/3040-30178/" data-ref-id="3040-30178">Kevin Conroy</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href="//www.giantbomb.com/cyborg/3005-8268/" data-ref-id="3005-8268">Cyborg</a></td><td><a href="//www.giantbomb.com/khary-payton/3040-85169/" data-ref-id="3040-85169">Khary Payton</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href="//www.giantbomb.com/flash/3005-541/" data-ref-id="3005-541">The Flash</a></td><td><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0568180/?ref_=nv_sr_2" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">Neal McDonough</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href="//www.giantbomb.com/green-arrow/3005-2296/" data-ref-id="3005-2296">Green Arrow</a></td><td>Main: <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/alan-tudyk/3040-80822/" data-ref-id="3040-80822">Alan Tudyk</a>/Arrow: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1854386/?ref_=nv_sr_1" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">Stephen Amell</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href="//www.giantbomb.com/green-lantern/3005-2292/" data-ref-id="3005-2292">Green Lantern</a></td><td><a href="//www.giantbomb.com/green-lantern/3005-2292/" data-ref-id="3005-2292">Hal</a>: <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/adam-baldwin/3040-89735/" data-ref-id="3040-89735">Adam Baldwin</a>/<a href="//www.giantbomb.com/john-stewart/3005-17707/" data-ref-id="3005-17707">John</a>: <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/phil-lamarr/3040-89594/" data-ref-id="3040-89594">Phil LaMarr</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href="//www.giantbomb.com/hawkgirl/3005-7153/" data-ref-id="3005-7153">Hawkgirl</a></td><td><a href="//www.giantbomb.com/jennifer-hale/3040-4269/" data-ref-id="3040-4269">Jennifer Hale</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href="//www.giantbomb.com/nightwing/3005-8204/" data-ref-id="3005-8204">Nightwing</a></td><td><a href="//www.giantbomb.com/nightwing/3005-8204/" data-ref-id="3005-8204">Dick</a>: <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/troy-baker/3040-93651/" data-ref-id="3040-93651">Troy Baker</a>/<a href="//www.giantbomb.com/damian-wayne/3005-24225/" data-ref-id="3005-24225">Damian</a>: Neal McDonough</td></tr><tr><td><a href="//www.giantbomb.com/raven/3005-8266/" data-ref-id="3005-8266">Raven</a></td><td><a href="//www.giantbomb.com/tara-strong/3040-22863/" data-ref-id="3040-22863">Tara Strong</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href="//www.giantbomb.com/shazam/3005-4576/" data-ref-id="3005-4576">Shazam</a></td><td><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0618577/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">Joey Naber</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href="//www.giantbomb.com/superman/3005-47/" data-ref-id="3005-47">Superman</a></td><td><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0627624/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">George Newbern</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href="//www.giantbomb.com/wonder-woman/3005-2301/" data-ref-id="3005-2301">Wonder Woman</a></td><td><a href="//www.giantbomb.com/susan-eisenberg/3040-104949/" data-ref-id="3040-104949">Susan Eisenberg</a></td></tr></tbody></table><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Playable Villains</th><th scope="col">Voice Actors</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="//www.giantbomb.com/ares/3005-10151/" data-ref-id="3005-10151">Ares</a></td><td><a href="//www.giantbomb.com/j-g-hertzler/3040-51568/" data-ref-id="3040-51568">J.

A vigilante group called the Watch_Dogs hacks into this data, using it to hunt criminals.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Watch Dogs (styled Watch_Dogs in marketing) follows <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/aiden-pearce/3005-23427/" data-ref-id="3005-23427">Aiden Pearce</a>, a hacker who can control the electrical grid and other systems in the city of <a href="/chicago/3035-293/" data-ref-id="3035-293">Chicago</a>. He possesses mobile hacking technology, which allows him to match people's real life identities with their online presences on the fly; he can also shut down mobile phone reception and listen in on phone calls.</p><p style="">Players can also take on the roles of other Watch Dogs and protect Aiden as he is chased by police. Multiple players exist in the city at one time, although when this multiplayer triggers or what other players would be doing when Aiden is not in trouble is unclear.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">Aiden Pierce has multiple smart-phone abilities that affect the environment of the city. He can hack into any device to receive information, gain abilities, or see through any camera. He can stop trains, raise security barriers, and black out the entire city. He can slow down time to shoot. He can direct companions through stealth sequences. And in all this he can call in the help of mobile players if he gets in a bind.</p><p style="">When the game was announced at the Ubisoft E3 2012 conference, a lengthy gameplay demonstration was shown. In this demonstration, the protagonist is shown controlling the electricity grid, which allows him to manipulate street lights. This power was used to create a pile-up to entrap a digital artist named Joseph Demarco. Another section of the demo shows him trying to gain access to a building. In order to distract the guard at the door he shuts down communications in that area of the city at which point calls are cut off for NPC's. This causes enough confusion that the guard effectively abandons his post and allows the player into the building.</p><p style="">At Sony's Playstation Meeting where they revealed the PS4, Ubisoft played through a brief open-world section of the game. "There is no mission," they said, as Aiden walked the streets of Chicago. Most NPCs he encountered had dossiers projected for Aiden to see, revealing a homeless man to be an Iraq War veteran and a suited man to be a Tobacco Executive and Pro Life activist. Using a radial menu Aiden hacks the suited man's bank account and takes out of a nearby ATM.</p><p style="">Aiden cannot control everything. A security camera run by another entity was marked in red and secure. He can, however, using background histories and probabilities, detect the likelihood of events. Because a woman who had recently won a child custody battle was walking near an alley where her former husband was waiting, a crime probability bar began filling up as she walked toward the ambush. Aiden had the choice to help her and he did, interceding when the man put her at knife point. There is then an optional chase sequence where cops are alerted due to gun fire. In an alley, Aiden takes control of an electrical panel, overheats it, and takes down the man. To escape the cops, he stops an El-Line train and hops aboard.</p><p style="">As well as Aiden's ability to use technology to hack into systems and manipulate electrical devices, he can also employ many other skills to accomplish his goals. These include sneaking around environments and hiding behind cover, parkour-like actions to quickly traverse the city, and the ability to slow down time.</p><p style="">At the Sony Press Conference at E3 2013, another gameplay demo showed Pierce navigating an alerted city in order to save his colleague T-Bone from discovery. Pierce drove his car stealthily through the city streets, using the mini-map and environmental awareness to avoid patrolling police vehicles. When spotted by a helicopter search light, however, he drove to a hidden parking garage on Chicago's Lower Wacker Drive, losing the cops and taking the back entrance into a humming coffee shop. However, due to his raised alert status, the TV in the shop projected his image and Pierce had to smash the cell phone of a patron calling 911. This sequence demonstrated the real-world impact of a raised alert, where even after breaking line of sight the player must be cautious as any TV could begin the chase anew.</p><p style="">Pierce reaches his destination of a nondescript building where he hacks into the security cameras, then into a laptop camera to locate T-Bone, who has found a piece of computer hardware that impresses him. Pierce appears to need line of sight in order to hack and affect the world, but he can gain it through any camera in the world. In this case, he sees a screen array that he can turn on to distract the guard and give T-Bone an exit. Pierce then takes on a squad-command role as he directs T-Bone across a courtyard patrolled by guards, with T-Bone following the player's commands. Pierce can turn the lights on the parked cars on to distract guards as well.</p><p style="">However, they are discovered as they escape and Pierce kills a private security man before being sighted by a police helicopter.</p><p style="">The "second-screen" functionality was then revealed further as Pierce called for a random mobile user's help. This user, on a tablet, is playing at the CtOS system itself. The user shuts down the helicopter's systems for a second, momentarily disabling it but not destroying it, giving Pierce the time to get away.</p><p style="">He runs into some cops, though, and must employ more gadgetry. On his smart-phone select screen of abilities, he chooses total blackout, which kills every light in the city. He then uses his unexplained slow motion power to aim and shoot out the cop's knee caps before escaping on a boat down the Chicago river</p><h2>Story</h2><p style="">In 2003, a disgruntled employee at a New York power plant secretly planted a virus in his company's computer system, which led to a massive blackout that disrupted power and communications to the entire northeastern US, resulting in hundreds of injuries and even a small number of deaths. 10 years later, a system called "CtOS" (Centralized Operating System) has simplified these connections, connecting entire cities in one gigantic network. The computers that run the CtOS are owned by corporations interested in collecting the massive "data shadows" of every person, for uses from selling products to influencing worldviews.</p><p style="">While the CtOS makes such connections easier, it is only a matter of time before someone figures out a way to hack into this network and use or abuse it to suit their own purposes, and when that happens, the damage could be even more catastrophic.</p><p style="">Enter the "Watch_Dogs", a group of vigilantes who have found a way to exploit this network to deal with criminals where normal law enforcement can't or won't do the job.<span style="font-size:16px;line-height:25px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', HelveticaNeue, Arial, sans-serif;">.</span></p><h2>Special Editions</h2><table

After being interrogated and lastly comforted, it is revealed that she posses a supernatural ability related to her newly shaved head bearing a fresh scar. According to game creator <a href="/david-cage/3040-20744/" data-ref-id="3040-20744">David Cage</a>, Jodie seems to be linked to the soul of a being trapped between life and death which grants her abilities that are beyond human understanding. Abilities like <a href="/telekinesis/3015-166/" data-ref-id="3015-166">telekinesis</a> and physical possession. She is powerful enough that a SWAT team was brought in covertly to bring her in. The game follows 15 years of Jodie's life, although it is unclear at this time how different years are handled or if they are even shown in any type of order.</p><p style="">Jodie Holmes is portrayed by and modelled after actress <a href="/ellen-page/3040-102137/" data-ref-id="3040-102137">Ellen Page</a>. An uncanny likeness is achieved using full body scanning. Ellen Page was chosen for the role by David Cage for her ability to portray strong yet flawed characters. He believes she is the perfect actress for the role and gamers will "fall in love" with her from the start of the game.</p><h3>"Kara" Technology</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6317/2227249-kara.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2227249" data-size="medium" style="width: 250px" data-ratio="0.56" data-width="250" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6317/2227249-kara.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2227249"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/6317/2227249-kara.jpg"></a><figcaption>Quantic Dream's "Kara" demo.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Although it is not confirmed, many have claimed it apparent that the facial animation engine utilized in the game's initial trailer, bares resemblance to the developing "Kara" technical demonstration. <a href="/quantic-dream/3010-2005/" data-ref-id="3010-2005">Quantic Dream</a> is using an evolved version of the technology used in <a href="/heavy-rain/3030-21304/" data-ref-id="3030-21304">Heavy Rain</a>; the updated tech combines body performance motion capture with full facial <a href="/motion-capture-animation/3015-5882/" data-ref-id="3015-5882">motion capture</a> which is used to deliver sophisticated performance animation.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>38541</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/82063/2555559-beyondclean.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82063/2555559-beyondclean.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/82063/2555559-beyondclean.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2555559-beyondclean.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/82063/2555559-beyondclean.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/82063/2555559-beyondclean.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/82063/2555559-beyondclean.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Beyond: Two Souls]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>13</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-16/]]></api_detail_url><id>16</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: M]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-2/]]></api_detail_url><id>2</id><name><![CDATA[PEGI: 16+]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2013-10-08 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-88/]]></api_detail_url><id>88</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation Network (PS3)]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-network-ps3/3045-88/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3N]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/]]></api_detail_url><id>146</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 4]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS4]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/beyond-two-souls/3030-38541/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[Payday: The Heist 2

Along with their handler (the mysterious Bain), the crew now take advantage of CRIMENET, an underground criminal network where they contract with local criminal contacts (such as deranged up-and-coming Vlad the Ukrainian, shady American politician "The Elephant", and Mexican drug trafficker Hector).</p><p style="">Using the CRIMENET interface, players can progress through various sizes of heists (from small-time convenience stores to major bank vaults), upgrade their criminal's special skills (through special <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/skill-tree/3015-382/" data-ref-id="3015-382">Skill Trees</a>), purchase various unlocked weapons (and weapon modifications), and customize their unlocked masks (with randomly-earned materials, patterns, and pattern colors). Along with an expanded metagame, the game now takes advantage of heists that are dynamic (with random geometry and events), multi-part (splitting the heist into separate levels), and open-ended (including branching paths that lead to completely different levels).</p><p style="">The PC version of the game later received numerous updates and <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/downloadable-content/3015-329/" data-ref-id="3015-329">downloadable content</a>, both free and paid, that include additional weapons, masks, heists (including cross-promotions with <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/valve-corporation/3010-1374/" data-ref-id="3010-1374">Valve's</a> <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/3030-36113/" data-ref-id="3030-36113">Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</a> and <a href="/dennaton/3010-8225/" data-ref-id="3010-8225">Dennaton's</a> <a href="/hotline-miami/3030-39452/" data-ref-id="3030-39452">Hotline Miami</a>), and changes to gameplay mechanics. Since January 2015, some of the DLC will be developed by spin-off developer <a href="/liongamelion/3010-11246/" data-ref-id="3010-11246">LionGameLion</a>. Much of the changes and DLC will be rolled into an upcoming "Crimewave Edition" for the <a href="/xbox-one/3045-145/" data-ref-id="3045-145">Xbox One</a> and <a href="/playstation-4/3045-146/" data-ref-id="3045-146">PlayStation 4</a> sometime in 2015.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h4>Offshore Account</h4><p style="">With each successful heist accomplished you will receive two different types of payments. Your offshore account is money that is presented to you at the beginning of a heist, it is a set amount given if you accomplish all parts of a heist successfully. The offshore funds can be used in several different ways.</p><p style="">The main purpose of the offshore funds is used for purchasing contracts from the brokers if you are hosting a game. The offshore funds can also be used in a hand of gambling through the offshore payday icon on the main map or to achieve infamous level if you are at level 100 and have the correct amount of cash.</p><h4>Cash</h4><p style="">This is the money that comes from loot bags and loose cash and jewelry successfully stolen during a heist. The cash funds is tallied at the end of a heist and is determined by the total amount divided by the number of players playing at the end of the mission. These funds are used for upgrading your skills, purchasing extra slots for your inventory, weapons, masks, and modifiers for the weapons and guns.</p><h2>Heisters</h2><p style="">In the first year of the game's release, the game only had four playable characters to choose from (smooth mobster Dallas, hardened mercenary Chains, happy-go-lucky Wolf, and the new Hoxton: Dallas's younger, more serious brother). As The Dentist and The Butcher heists were released, players could choose more characters (including the original Hoxton, if the player breaks him out of custody).</p><p style="">Some of the new characters must be unlocked as DLC (which includes additional weapons and Perk Decks associated with each character).</p><p style="">While characters are often associated with certain Skill Trees and Perk Decks, they are not limited to any and have no additional benefits with any. However, they do have their own uniquely-colored suits and have a unique default mask (though a special version of the masks can be unlocked for further customization and use by any character).</p><ul><li><a href="/dallas/3005-21878/" data-ref-id="3005-21878">Dallas</a> - The Crew Chief (and Mastermind) of the gang.</li><li><a href="/chains/3005-21879/" data-ref-id="3005-21879">Chains</a> - The Muscle (and Enforcer) of the gang.</li><li><a href="/wolf/3005-21877/" data-ref-id="3005-21877">Wolf</a> - The Armorer (and Technician) of the gang.</li><li><a href="/houston/3005-31116/" data-ref-id="3005-31116">Houston</a> - The Rogue (and Ghost) of the gang.

Unlocked as DLC.</li></ul><p style=""> </p><h2>Enemies</h2><p style="">Payday 2 includes a wide variety of enemies ready to take down the Payday crew.</p><p style="">All enemies are stronger in the Death Wish difficulty, having more HP (almost double) and headshot resistance.</p><p style=""> </p><h3>Normal Enemies</h3><p style="">Normal enemies are the most common type of enemies encountered and usually carry no special traits. They can be intimidated with the Dominator skill and forced to fight on your side with the Joker skill.</p><p style=""> </p><h4>Security Guards</h4><p style="">Weak security guards (30 HP) who patrol a given area, causing difficulty to players who want to stealth the mission.</p><p style="">In addition to bypassing them, they can be taken down in one hit (when not alerted) and can be dominated easily. Either way, a player must answer a pager located on the dead/cuffed enemy in order for the alarm not to be raised. If the player answers more than four pagers, cancels interaction with the pager, or fails to respond to the pager after a short amount of time, the alarm is immediately raised.</p><p style="">If the guard detects suspicious behavior (such as loud gunfire, broken cameras, and loot bags), he will raise an alarm and call his operator using his earpiece. If the player fails to eliminate him while he's calling his operator (and there is no ECM Jammer in place), the alarm is immediately raised. Guards also draw their weapons and can fire at a nearby player (causing all other guards to be alarmed).</p><p style="">It is possible for the guard, when he's nearby a player and detects him, to place the player in <a href="/handcuffs/3055-1441/" data-ref-id="3055-1441">handcuffs</a>. Players who are cuffed can be uncuffed by another player or can lockpick their handcuffs after one minute.</p><p style="">In some occasions, players can find red-shirted GenSec security guards. They are slightly tougher (with 50 HP).</p><p style="">In the Shadow Raid heist, the guards are heavily-armored (with 130 HP) and carry sub-machine guns and assault rifles. Despite their increased durability, they can still be taken out in one hit when they are not alerted.</p><p style=""> </p><h4>Gangs/Mobsters</h4><p style="">Only found in the beginning of some heists, these enemies are weak (40 HP) and use pistols or sub-machine guns.</p><p style="">In some occasions, players can use stealth to bypass a loud fight with them. While they do not utilize pagers, alerting one of them can quickly alert the entire gang/mob. Also, in some occasions, these enemies initially appear friendly towards the players (but quickly turn when things go sour).</p><p style="">They cannot be intimidated by the Dominator skill.</p><p style=""> </p><h4>First Responders</h4><p style="">Weak police officers (30 HP) that arrive at the heist location shortly after an alarm is raised. They carry pistols, revolvers, sub-machine guns, or shotguns. They do not usually appear on Overkill and Death Wish difficulties.</p><p style="">Eliminating a lot of them before the first assault wave quickens the arrival of that wave.</p><p style=""> </p><h4>Hostage Rescue Units</h4><p style="">Special FBI agents that are sent in to rescue hostages in the area (usually between assault waves). Agents with no armor (known by their blue jackets or white shirts) have 50 HP and utilize pistols or assault rifles. Agents with light armor (known by their <a href="/ski-mask/3055-1815/" data-ref-id="3055-1815">balaclavas</a>) have 80 HP and utilize sub-machine guns.</p><p style=""> </p><h4>SWAT Teams</h4><p style="">The most common enemies found in the game are the many variants of SWAT squads:</p><ul><li>Commonly found in the Normal difficulty are lightly-armored SWAT squads (with a blue uniform, light helmets, 80 HP, and the use of either sub-machine guns or pump-action shotguns).</li></ul><ul><li>Commonly found in the Hard difficulty are heavier SWAT squads (with heavier helmets that resist headshot bonuses, 100 HP, and the use of assault rifles).</li></ul><ul><li>Commonly found in the Very Hard and Overkill difficulties are FBI SWAT squads (with a green uniform, light helmets, 130 HP, and the use of either assault rifles or pump-action shotguns).</li></ul><ul><li>Only found in the Death Wish difficulty are Elite SWAT squads (with an urban camo uniform, heavy helmets, 200 HP (after DW bonus), and the use of custom assault rifles, sub-machine guns, and semi-automatic shotguns).</li></ul><p style=""> </p><h4>Heavy SWAT Teams</h4><p style="">Heavily-armored Special Ops squads (with 200 HP) known for their heavy helmets (with high headshot damage resistance) and tan/brown body armor (protecting them from most small-arms fire). They will not appear on Normal and Hard difficulties.</p><p style=""> </p><h3>Special Enemies</h3><p style="">Special enemies are unique enemies that carry special traits. Their ability to take down players quickly forces players to adjust their strategy.</p><p style="">All special enemies can be marked by players, alerting other players of their location. These markings disappear after a short time. Learning the Spotter skill causes your markings to add a 15% damage bonus against them.</p><p style="">They cannot be intimidated by the Dominator skill.</p><p style=""> </p><h4>Shields</h4><p style="">Standard (100 HP) SWAT officers (with a pistol) or FBI SWAT officers (with a submachine gun) who carry <a href="/riot-shield/3055-2537/" data-ref-id="3055-2537">riot shields</a> to protect them (and any units behind them).</p><p style="">While most weaponry cannot penetrate the riot shields (the only exclusions being sniper rifles and shotguns with AP slug ammo), they can be flanked from the sides (and from behind). Dropped riot shields can still block covering fire, to the benefit or detriment of the player.</p><p style="">Acing the Iron Man skill allows the player to melee Shields, knocking them back while exposing their front).</p><p style=""> </p><h4>Tasers</h4><p style="">Special SWAT units with heavy armor (360 HP with helmet) and <a href="/taser/3055-748/" data-ref-id="3055-748">tasers</a> (in addition to his rifle) that can paralyze players where they stand.</p><p style="">When they are close enough to a player (and have line-of-sight), they will charge their tasers (as noted by a high-pitched buzzing noise) before firing. The player who is hit will convulse (not allowing them to move or interact with any object) and randomly fire their weapons until the Taser is knocked away (or dead) or until ten seconds elapses (in which the player will immediately become incapacitated).</p><p style="">Learning the Shockproof skill allows the player to easily survive being tased by automatically knocking back the Taser after a few seconds. Acing the skill allows the player to turn the tables on the Taser by shocking them back (dealing major damage).</p><p style=""> </p><h4>Snipers</h4><p style="">Weak <a href="/enemy-sniper/3015-3655/" data-ref-id="3015-3655">sniping </a>enemies (40 HP) who, far away on windows and rooftops, can take out a large chunk of health and armor with their long-ranged rifles.</p><p style="">Bain will usually announce their arrival, and sometimes they come by helicopter. After finding their perch, they will scan for players with a bright red laser.</p><p style=""> </p><h4>Cloakers</h4><p style="">Powerful stealth units (600 HP) who are quick and nimble, allowing them to bull-rush forward and incapacitate players with one well-placed kick. Fortunately, their lightly-armored helmets make their heads very weak targets.</p><p style="">They will normally appear from unexpected locations, such as manhole covers and ventilation ducts (sometimes in close proximity to a player) and will always emit a low-pitched humming noise. Often times, they either hide in various locations (such as behind doors and under vehicles) or fire against the player (with their sub-machine guns) while evading player fire.</p><p style="">When a Cloaker is ready to ambush a player, he will emit a higher-pitched shrill and rush towards the player (even following it around corners) before delivering a special kick (<a href="/roundhouse-kick/3015-509/" data-ref-id="3015-509">roundhouse</a>, drop-kick, or <a href="/somersault/3015-2663/" data-ref-id="3015-2663">somersault</a>). If the player is close enough and behind an object, the Cloaker will instead perform a jump-kick over the object (rarely missing the player). Once the player is down, he will relentlessly beat the player with a baton while taunting (often <a href="/breaking-the-fourth-wall/3015-138/" data-ref-id="3015-138">breaking the fourth wall</a>). If he is spotted by other players, he will throw down a <a href="/smoke-grenade/3055-621/" data-ref-id="3055-621">smoke grenade</a> and back away.</p><p style="">The Cloaker was originally removed from the game since the beta version, and was later added to the PC version when the Gage Weapons Pack #2 DLC was released.</p><p style=""> </p><h4>Bulldozers</h4><p style="">The strongest enemy in the game (with a whopping 5,500 HP), Bulldozers wear huge bomb disposal suits and carry powerful weapons (causing massive damage if the player is in line-of-sight). Despite their massive strength, they have slow movement speed and lightly-armored visors (which must be weakened by constant shots to the headpiece).</p><p style="">There are three types of Bulldozers found in the game:</p><ul><li>Green Bulldozers that wield pump-action shotguns. Powerful damage per shot, but low rate-of-fire and shorter range efficiency.</li></ul><ul><li>Black Bulldozers that wield semi-automatic shotguns. Less damage per shot, but high rate-of-fire and longer range efficiency.</li></ul><ul><li>GenSec Elite Bulldozers (known as Skulldozers due to wearing a skull decal on their faceplates) that wield light machine guns. Only found in the Death Wish difficulty. Powerful damage and high rate-of-fire, despite a longer reload time.</li></ul><p style="">An additional type of Bulldozer, the Headless Bulldozer, was found in the Safehouse Nightmare heist during the Halloween 2013 update. They are similar to Black Bulldozers, but they have no additional bonus to headshots (due to having no heads). For the Halloween 2014 update, it was replaced with the Headless Titandozer (who now carries the light machine gun and a whopping 11,000 HP, despite weakened enemy AI in which it will not attack players that do not look at it).</p><p style=""> </p><h2>Skills</h2><p style="">Replacing the Upgrades system of Payday: The Heist is the Skills system, in which players can upgrade each of five unique <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/skill-tree/3015-382/" data-ref-id="3015-382">skill trees</a>, granting them unique and beneficial bonuses (which can be further upgraded for even new bonuses). Unlike the Upgrades system, weapons and specific weapon upgrades are not tied to skill trees, players can not upgrade their skill tree in the middle of a heist, and players must map out their skill tree in a certain way with a limited amount of Skill Points (rather than unlock each upgrade level consecutively).</p><p style="">Each of the five Skill trees has 17 Skills, grouped into six tiers of three Skills each (and one Skill to unlock the tree). Depending on their tier, they require either 1 SP or 4 SP to unlock. Each Skill can be "Aced" to significantly buff the effect (or give another effect entirely) for either 3 SP or 8 SP (depending on tier). Players must spend earned cash to unlock (or Ace) a Skill, and can only access the next tier by putting a certain amount of SP into Skills below that tier. Unlocking tiers used to give passive bonuses for the player in earlier versions of the game, which are now instead put into Perk Decks.</p><p style="">Players earn 1 SP each time they level up (with a bonus 2 SP for every 10 levels), giving them a total of 120 SP when fully leveled. Although they cannot refund their Skills individually, they can refund an entire skill tree (including most of the cash that was used to unlock those Skills). Players lose all of their SP every time they become Infamous.</p><p style="">In earlier versions, players had only one "Skill Set" for their Skill configuration (requiring players to rebuy their skill trees for certain situations). Now, players can unlock new "Skill Sets" which can be swapped for no cash penalty (other than the initial set-up), but only from the heist setup menu, so if you choose a setup for day 1, you have to keep it for the rest of the heist.</p><p style=""> </p><h3>Mastermind</h3><p style="">The Mastermind tree is beneficial for players who want to control tense situations, giving them abilities to assist the rest of the crew (mostly <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/healer/3015-188/" data-ref-id="3015-188">medical</a> assistance) while allowing them to easily control the crowd (and even control enemies).</p><p style="">The deployable unlocked by the Mastermind tree is the <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/first-aid-kit/3055-1285/" data-ref-id="3055-1285">Doctor Bag</a>, which can be placed to allow players to fully heal and reset the number of bleedouts before being immediately incapacitated. Each Doctor Bag has two "uses" before being removed from the game. Optional Skills in the tree allow players to deploy two bags in one level, and to double the amount of "uses" per bag.</p><p style="">Other important parts of the Mastermind tree revolve around the ability to shout down enemies to use as hostages, and even convert those enemies to fight on the side of the players.</p><p style=""> </p><h3>Enforcer</h3><p style="">The Enforcer tree is beneficial for players who prefer aggression, increasing their survivability while allowing them to carry heavier gear (including a portable saw and heavy armor).</p><p style="">The deployable unlocked by the Enforcer tree is the <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/ammo/3055-533/" data-ref-id="3055-533">Ammo Bag</a>, which can be placed to allow players to fully restock their weapons. Each Ammo Bag has a limited amount of uses (depending on the amount of ammo restocked) before being removed from the game. Optional Skills in the tree allow players to deploy two bags in one level, to double the amount of ammo per bag, and to fire their weapon without using any ammo for a limited amount of time after deploying the bag.</p><p style="">The other important part of the Enforcer tree is the Circular saw, which is an important item to save time on a lot of heists, allowing the Enforcer to cut through doors and into lockboxes much quicker than they could otherwise.</p><p style=""> </p><h3>Technician</h3><p style="">The Technician tree is beneficial for players who work with a variety of devices (including <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/drill/3055-1946/" data-ref-id="3055-1946">drills</a>, multi-functional <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/explosives/3055-91/" data-ref-id="3055-91">explosives</a>, and <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/automated-sentry-gun/3055-68/" data-ref-id="3055-68">automated sentry guns</a>).</p><p style="">The main deployable unlocked by the Technician is the <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/laser-trip-mine/3055-3434/" data-ref-id="3055-3434">Trip Mine</a>, which can be placed (up to two per level) to explode when an enemy passes through its laser sensor. Optional Skills in the tree grant additional Trip Mines for the level, reduces the arming time, change it to a non-exploding <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/motion-sensor/3055-5809/" data-ref-id="3055-5809">motion sensor</a> (which also spots special enemies), increase the blast radius, and allow players to use them as "shaped charges" (allowing them to breach through certain safes and doors).</p><p style="">The second deployable unlocked by the Technician (late in the tree) is the Sentry Gun, which can be deployed to automatically fire upon enemies for a short amount of time (until it runs out of ammo or until it is destroyed by enemies). Optional Skills in the tree increase the amount of health and ammunition, give it a <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/shield/3055-87/" data-ref-id="3055-87">shield</a> for protection, increase the amount of damage it can deal, allow players to replenish its ammunition with their own, and allow the player to deploy two Sentry Guns per level.</p><p style="">The Technician can eventually get a skill to allow the use of both of their deployables in one level, which is incredibly handy. The Technician also focuses heavily on being able to speed up and eventually silence the drills that the players use in the majority of levels.</p><p style=""> </p><h3>Ghost</h3><p style="">The Ghost tree is beneficial for players who prefer <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/stealth/3015-24/" data-ref-id="3015-24">stealth</a>, giving them abilities to prevent detection while increasing their agility.</p><p style="">The deployable unlocked by the Ghost tree is the ECM Jammer, which can be placed to temporarily disable electronic devices (such as surveillance cameras). Optional Skills in the tree grant an additional ECM Jammer for the level, increase the time that it is active, disrupt enemy pagers, hack open doors that require keycards, and allow players to interact with it (causing a "feedback loop", which have a chance to stun nearby enemies for a limited time and can be reset every four minutes).</p><p style="">The Ghost can also put nearby security cameras into a loop for an amount of time, allowing the players to sneak past. They can also pick locks much faster than the rest of the crew, eventually culminating in being able to crack safes by hand.</p><p style=""> </p><h3 style="margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;">Fugitive</h3><p style="">The Fugitive tree, added in the Hoxton Breakout update, is beneficial for players who want to survive with low armor, increasing their agility while giving them abilities that benefit from minimum armor.</p><p style="">The main deployable unlocked by the Fugitive tree is the <a href="/first-aid-kit/3055-1285/" data-ref-id="3055-1285">First Aid Kit</a>, which can be placed (up to four per level) to allow players to quickly and fully heal. Unlike the Doctor Bag, the smaller first aid kits are quicker to interact with and the player can carry more of them, at the cost of its one-time use and inability to reset the number of "bleedouts". Optional Skills in the tree allow players to deploy up to 14 kits in one level, and to deploy the bag twice as fast.</p><p style="">The second deployable unlocked late in the tree is the Body Bag Case, which can be placed to allow players to replenish their count of body bags. Each case has three body bags and players can not exceed their maximum amount of carried bags (by default, one bag). An optional skill in the tree allows players to carry two cases in one level.</p><p style="">The Fugitive also heavily relies on a stat known as 'Dodge' which is boosted in the upper echelons of the Fugitive tree. This allows them to wear very little armor while not getting hit by bullets, making The Fugitive handy when the players need to get across the map quickly.</p><p style=""> </p><h2>Heists</h2><p style="">There are five contract brokers that players can earn (or purchase) jobs from. Some heists also have an alternate "Pro Job", which earn players more experience points and cash (but must be earned or purchased again when failed). Bank Heist, Bank Heist: Gold, Big Oil, and Ukrainian Job can only be completed as Pro Jobs.</p><p style="">Some heists are sold as downloadable content, in which players can only receive those jobs if they own the corresponding DLC packs. Players without the DLC can still join games of other players who do and can still earn job-specific achievements, however if those achievements would unlock cosmetic items, the items remain locked until that player has purchased the DLC.</p><h3>Bain</h3><p style="">Bain is the person who set up the crime.net system the payday gang uses to get contracts. His jobs encompass a wide range of themes and skills.</p><ul><li>Art Gallery <ul><li>The first day of Framing Frame as a separate heist.

It is developed by <a href="/digital-extremes/3010-2159/" data-ref-id="3010-2159">Digital Extremes</a>, the team responsible for <a href="/dark-sector/3030-20497/" data-ref-id="3030-20497">Dark Sector</a>, <a href="/the-darkness-ii/3030-22425/" data-ref-id="3030-22425">The Darkness 2</a> and the multiplayer component of <a href="/bioshock-2/3030-20827/" data-ref-id="3030-20827">Bioshock 2</a>. Warframe is loosely based on the <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/articles/closing-digital-extreme-s-psychic-wound/1100-4555/" data-ref-id="1100-4555">original design document for Dark Sector</a>, which dates back to 2004 at the latest. Since its launch in March 2013, the game has seen a number of system-wide changes such as replacing a node-based upgrade tree with ability cards, the addition of Sentinels and Clans, and soon, player-to-player trading.</p><p style="">Along with their own games, the developer also cited the influence of online multiplayer games such as <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/phantasy-star-online/3025-453/" data-ref-id="3025-453">Phantasy Star Online</a> and <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/left-4-dead/3025-1342/" data-ref-id="3025-1342">Left 4 Dead</a>.</p><p style="">Several character and environment designs in the game are the work of illustrator Keith Thompson, who has also contributed to <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/borderlands/3030-20487/" data-ref-id="3030-20487">Borderlands</a> and the film <em>Pacific Rim</em>.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style=""><a href="/tenno/3015-8338/" data-ref-id="3015-8338">Tenno</a>, warriors of blades, guns and masters of the Warframe armor were left drifting in the ruins of an old war are now needed again to stop the vast armies of the <a href="/grineer/3015-8342/" data-ref-id="3015-8342">Grineer</a> from taking over the entire solar system.

Stored in their cryopods for centuries after an old war are awakened into a new war were they must fight and resist the Grineer Empire's attempt to conquer the Solar System. Their memories have faded but their ability to use a gun, sword and exo-armor have not. The historic values of the Tenno are chivalry and discipline but they may not all be so in this new war as they emerge into this unfamiliar world.

They took over Earth by their numbers alone. While high in power the Grineer army is decaying. The constant cloning is increasingly making them more primitive.

The Corpus are rarely seen by others and are better known for their robot proxies that serve them. The Corpus have taken the social structure from ancient mercantile guilds from the old Earth.

It is speculated that J3-Golem, a boss of the Infected, was created alongside the plague by the Orokin themselves as a super weapon against "the Sentients". This boss also hints to the player during battle that it may be Tenno itself, which would contradict the Lotus' statement that "no Tenno have fallen to the plague". It is unknown whether J3-Golem was at one point a Tenno, or if the Lotus is an unreliable narrator.</p><h3>Lotus</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="medium" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/26998/2476531-1366766263234.png" data-ref-id="1300-2476531" style="width: 256px" data-ratio="1" data-width="256" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/26998/2476531-1366766263234.png" data-ref-id="1300-2476531"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/26998/2476531-1366766263234.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/26998/2476531-1366766263234.png"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">The Lotus is an organization of mysterious origins who has close links to the Tenno and their technology.

These consist of a Long Gun (such as a rifle, shotgun, or sniper rifle), a sidearm that can be used single-handed or dual-wielded, and a melee weapon.</p><p style="">Weapons level up by using them in combat and by picking up white Affinity orbs. By leveling up, weapons gain new ranks that offer the ability to equip more mods. Each weapon can be ranked to level 30 but this can go up to a total of 60 once the weapon has been supercharged. To improve a weapon further, mods can be used and placed within the eight mod slots available for every weapon. Mods are randomly dropped from enemies and bosses and can significantly boost base weapon attributes or add unique effects to the weapon.</p><p style="">New players start with the MK1-Braton automatic rifle, Lato pistol and Skana sword as their default loadout. Additional weapons can be acquired either from crafting them from blueprints in the Forge or by purchasing them directly from the Marketplace.</p><h2>Mastery Rank</h2><p style="">Mastery is an in-game method of measuring a players cumulative skill by how many weapons they have increased in rank. Protected by anti-exploitative measures, this system has on some weapons a minimum level before mastery experience is given. Mastery Rank s unlocking weapons that are capped by level and can be viewed by clicking on the profile menu.</p><p style="">Sentinels earn 100 mastery points per level while upgrading your Warframe will garner you 200 mastery points per level. Certain weapons such as the Lato and Mk-1 Braton are weapons which currently have a threshold that must be hit in rank before they start giving Mastery Points.</p><h2>Tenno Armaments</h2><h3>Long

Most of these items can be crafted by using blueprints in the foundry, or by purchasing them from the in-game Marketplace using one of two currencies. F2P Credits are earned by completing missions, killing enemy units, or as random drops from breakables during each mission. Platinum on the other hand, can only be acquired using real money (US Dollars or other currency). The Marketplace has items that can be purchased with either Credits or Platinum. Certain items, mostly cosmetic, can only be purchased with Platinum</p><p style="">Platinum can currently be purchased in a variety of tiers:</p><table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Platinum Points</th><th scope="col">USD</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2100 Pt (1500 + 600 Bonus Pt)</td><td>$99.99</td></tr><tr><td>1000 Pt (750 + 250 Bonus Pt)</td><td>$49.99</td></tr><tr><td>570 Pt (450 + 120 Bonus Pt)</td><td>$29.99</td></tr><tr><td>170 Pt (150 + 20 Bonus Pt)</td><td>$9.99</td></tr><tr><td>75 Pt</td><td>$4.99</td></tr></tbody></table><p style="">These prices are subject to change before the time of launch.

The game takes place on a minimalist two-dimensional plane, with stark black surfaces and a moody electronic soundtrack. Players control a number of different characters, which are all simple colored quadrilaterals with varying degrees of movement speed, jump height, and other special abilities. With the ability to <a href="/on-the-fly-character-switching/3015-4385/" data-ref-id="3015-4385">switch characters on the fly</a>, players must get each shape to it's corresponding exit to complete the level, often helping each other by creating platforms, traversing spike pits, pushing switches, etc. The game is comprised of 100 levels, broken down into 10 chapters of 10 levels each.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style="">While aesthetically simplistic, the game places a large focus on narrative. None of the colored blocks ever speak, and instead a <a href="/dynamic-narration/3015-5955/" data-ref-id="3015-5955">narrator</a> (voiced by <a href="/daniel-wallace/3040-97200/" data-ref-id="3040-97200">Danny Wallace</a>) tells the story as players move through the game. The colored blocks are all given names and personalities, and as they help each other through the game, develop attachments and aversions to each other.</p><p style="">The game begins with Thomas becoming aware that he exists. As he moves through the game, he meets other characters who have also had a similar awakening. At the beginning of each chapter, quotes from various fictional software engineers and corporate CEOs are displayed on-screen, each one talking about how certain self-aware artificial intelligences emerged in the systems they were creating. It quickly becomes clear that the AIs they're referring to are the colored blocks themselves, and their quest to escape.</p><h2>Characters</h2><h4>Thomas</h4><p style="">The eponymous character that starts off the game. Thomas is a red rectangle with a chipper attitude, and has average jump height and movement speed.</p><h4>Chris</h4><p style="">Chris is a orange square with a more dismal outlook on life. He has a low jump height and slow movement speed.</p><h4>John</h4><p style="">John is a long yellow rectangle, and has a very high jump and fast speed. He is always eager to show off his better abilities.</p><h4>Claire</h4><p style="">Claire is a large blue square, whose jump height and speed are rather slow, but she has the extra ability of being able to float in water (all other characters die instantly.) This causes her to think she is a superhero.</p><h4>Laura</h4><p style="">Laura is a pink rectangle laid on its side. Her jump and speed are average, but she has the added ability to act as a trampoline for other characters, giving them a boost to higher areas.</p><h4>James</h4><p style="">A doppelganger to Thomas, this green rectangle has the same movement speeds as him, but falls up instead of down, traveling along the ceiling of levels. James would rather be left alone.</p><h4>Sarah</h4><p style="">A rectangle smaller than all the rest, Sarah has the special ability to perform a <a href="/double-jump/3015-1/" data-ref-id="3015-1">double jump</a>.

The player controls an unnamed character equipped with a flashlight. <i>Home</i> has few controls: the left, right, and up arrow keys and the space bar. Pressing left or right moves the character in those directions; pressing up makes the character shine his flashlight upward. The player can interact with highlighted objects by pressing the space bar. Interacting with items usually results in a description of the item. Occasionally, the game will allow the player to further interact with items through a "Yes/No" prompt. <i>Home</i> has few traditional puzzles. The true puzzle in <i>Home</i> is trying to figure out what is going on. <i>Home</i> never explicitly tells you its story. Instead, <i>Home</i> lets you piece together several pieces of the story while omitting critical details. Through your actions playing the game, <i>Home</i> encourages you to construct your own story. After you finish <i>Home</i>, it suggests you go to <a href="http://www.homehorror.com/whathappened" rel="nofollow">homehorror.com/whathappened</a>. On the site, you can submit your interpretation of the game's story or read others' interpretations.</p><h2>System Requirement</h2><h2><strong>OS:</strong><span> Windows XP, Windows 7</span></h2><ul><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Core 2 Duo or above</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2 GB RAM</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Graphics card with 256 MB RAM</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong> 300 MB HD space</li><li><strong>Sound:</strong> Soundblaster or equivalent</li><li><strong>OS:</strong> OS 10.7 Lion or above</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Core 2 Duo</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2 GB RAM</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Graphics card with 256 MB RAM</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong> 50 MB HD space</li></ul>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>38860</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/11/117587/2306492-homeboxc.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/117587/2306492-homeboxc.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/11/117587/2306492-homeboxc.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117587/2306492-homeboxc.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/11/117587/2306492-homeboxc.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/11/117587/2306492-homeboxc.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/11/117587/2306492-homeboxc.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Home]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>2</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating/><original_release_date>2012-06-01 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-17/]]></api_detail_url><id>17</id><name><![CDATA[Mac]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/mac/3045-17/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[MAC]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-96/]]></api_detail_url><id>96</id><name><![CDATA[iPhone]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/iphone/3045-96/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[IPHN]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-121/]]></api_detail_url><id>121</id><name><![CDATA[iPad]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/ipad/3045-121/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[IPAD]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-143/]]></api_detail_url><id>143</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation Network (Vita)]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-network-vita/3045-143/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PSNV]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/]]></api_detail_url><id>146</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 4]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS4]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/home/3030-38860/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-38889/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2012-07-04 15:05:50</date_added><date_last_updated>2015-10-13 17:59:05</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[Telltale's continuation of the Back to the Future story.

As with most rhythm games, multipliers are gained and scores are increased the longer you go without making a mistake.</p><p style="">The game features a tracklist of 18 songs.</p><h2>Tracklist</h2><p style=""><i>(partial)</i></p><ul><li>Pendulum – Self vs. Self</li><li>Marilyn Manson – The Beautiful People</li><li>Rob Zombie – Scum of the Earth</li><li>Voicians – The Construct</li><li>Shen Yi – War Dance</li><li>Celldweller – I Can't Wait</li><li>Styles of Beyond – Nine Thou</li><li>Southpaw Swagger – It's Showtime</li><li>Blue Stahli – Ultranumb</li><li>Papa Roach - Last Resort</li><li>P.O.D. - Boom</li></ul>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>38893</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/6/63119/2255930-kickbeat.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/63119/2255930-kickbeat.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/6/63119/2255930-kickbeat.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/63119/2255930-kickbeat.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/6/63119/2255930-kickbeat.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/63119/2255930-kickbeat.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/6/63119/2255930-kickbeat.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[KickBeat]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-1/]]></api_detail_url><id>1</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: T]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2013-09-03 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-88/]]></api_detail_url><id>88</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation Network (PS3)]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-network-ps3/3045-88/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3N]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-139/]]></api_detail_url><id>139</id><name><![CDATA[Wii U]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/wii-u/3045-139/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[WIIU]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-143/]]></api_detail_url><id>143</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation Network (Vita)]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-network-vita/3045-143/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PSNV]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-145/]]></api_detail_url><id>145</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox One]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-one/3045-145/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[XONE]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/]]></api_detail_url><id>146</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 4]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS4]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/kickbeat/3030-38893/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[World of Planes]]></aliases><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-38992/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2012-07-13 10:22:07</date_added><date_last_updated>2015-03-12 23:44:08</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[War Thunder is a free-to-play air combat game set in the World War II and Korean War eras.

Like its primary competitor <a href="/wargamingnet/3010-4066/" data-ref-id="3010-4066">WarGaming.net</a>, War Thunder will eventually span all three major types of warfare (aerial, naval, ground). The first type being focused on is aerial combat.</p><h2>Aerial Combat</h2><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82565/2473068-12843801563566702592_screenshots_2013-04-20_00003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2473068" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82565/2473068-12843801563566702592_screenshots_2013-04-20_00003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2473068"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82565/2473068-12843801563566702592_screenshots_2013-04-20_00003.jpg"></a></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The aerial portion of War Thunder was originally called World of Planes. The name was changed due to perceived confusion with WarGaming.net's <a href="/world-of-warplanes/3030-35772/" data-ref-id="3030-35772">World of Warplanes</a>. It features period accurate planes and locations from 1939 to 1953. Many historical battles from the second world war and the Korean war are represented as maps.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">There are multiple difficulty modes depending upon how much realism you desire. Arcade mode is essentially a more simplistic multiplayer shooter while historical battles mode will require more advanced techniques like taking off and landing during battles and realistic damage modelling.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">There are five countries represented in War Thunder; <a href="/the-united-states-of-america/3035-396/" data-ref-id="3035-396">United States</a>, <a href="/united-kingdom/3035-492/" data-ref-id="3035-492">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="/soviet-union/3035-507/" data-ref-id="3035-507">Soviet Union</a>, <a href="/japan/3035-37/" data-ref-id="3035-37">Japan</a>, and <a href="/germany/3035-281/" data-ref-id="3035-281">Germany</a>. There are two more planned countries which have yet to be included in the game; <a href="/australia/3035-292/" data-ref-id="3035-292">Australia</a> and <a href="/italy/3035-1451/" data-ref-id="3035-1451">Italy</a>. Each have their own unlock trees and sets of planes. As one is levelled, that progress is not transferred to the others. Within each nationality the player has a hangar holding 3-7 planes of their own with many levelling and customisation options. Researching planes and upgrading crews use a mixture of various currencies; some earned in gameplay, some purchased with money.</p><h4><em><strong>Alpha</strong></em></h4><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The War Thunder aerial alpha ran from October 2011 to March 2012.</p><h4><em><strong>Beta</strong></em></h4><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82565/2473072-11058465039659827200_screenshots_2013-04-22_00003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2473072" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82565/2473072-11058465039659827200_screenshots_2013-04-22_00003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2473072"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82565/2473072-11058465039659827200_screenshots_2013-04-22_00003.jpg"></a><figcaption>Crashing without a tail in the beta.</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The closed beta began in March 2012 and concluded in October 2012.

Xbox One.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Battlefield 4 is a modern-military first-person shooter developed by <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/ea-digital-illusions-ce/3010-4880/" data-ref-id="3010-4880">DICE</a> and published by <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/electronic-arts/3010-1/" data-ref-id="3010-1">Electronic Arts</a>. It was initially released for <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/" data-ref-id="3045-20">Xbox 360</a>, <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/" data-ref-id="3045-35">PlayStation 3</a>, and <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC</a> on October 29th, 2013 and later released as a day-one <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/launch-titles/3015-238/" data-ref-id="3015-238">launch title</a> for the <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/" data-ref-id="3045-146">PlayStation 4</a> and <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/xbox-one/3045-145/" data-ref-id="3045-145">Xbox One</a>.</p><h2>Campaign</h2><figure style="width: 480px" data-align="right" data-size="medium" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56742/2460484-close_1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2460484" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56742/2460484-close_1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2460484"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/56742/2460484-close_1920x1080.jpg"></a></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Battlefield 4's single player campaign takes place in the year 2020, six years after the events of <a href="/battlefield-3/3030-27006/" data-ref-id="3030-27006">Battlefield 3</a>. The story primary follows Tombstone, a squad of US Marines tasked with stopping a military coup in China and preventing all-out war. Russia and China appear as the opposing factions.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Unlike the previous game, Battlefield 4's campaign is occasionally peppered with more open environments that allow for some player freedom, although the majority of the campaign still consists of scripted encounters. Completing campaign missions unlocks some weapons for use in multiplayer.</p><h3>Campaign Missions</h3><ol><li>Baku</li><li><a href="/shanghai/3035-2713/" data-ref-id="3035-2713">Shanghai</a></li><li>South China Sea</li><li><a href="/singapore/3035-1881/" data-ref-id="3035-1881">Singapore</a></li><li>Kunlan Mountains</li><li>Tashgar</li><li>Suez</li></ol><h2>Multiplayer</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Battlefield 4 continues the series tradition of <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/class-based-shooter/3015-305/" data-ref-id="3015-305">class-based</a> multiplayer mechanics with <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/objective-based-team-gameplay/3015-620/" data-ref-id="3015-620">objective-driven gameplay</a>. Maps and modes involve both large-scale vehicular warfare, as well as smaller infantry-only scenarios. The revamped <a href="/frostbite-3-0/3015-7847/" data-ref-id="3015-7847">Frostbite 3</a> engine allows for more enhanced destruction and interactive environments. A <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/spectating/3015-3179/" data-ref-id="3015-3179">Spectator Mode</a> has been added if players simply want to watch the action. Players will again have the ability to rent servers to personalize the experience.</p><h3>Levolution</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">"Levolution" refers to the dynamic destruction capable in multiplayer, so called because of the players increased ability to alter &amp; interact with the physical characteristics of the map. This includes small things like being able to open &amp; close doors, ride elevators, shoot out lights, as well as referring to much larger "events". Each map has one major Levolution event that significantly alters the terrain of the map, such as a toppling skyscraper in the map Siege of Shanghai, or a destroyer ship beaching onto an island in Paracel Storm.</p><h3>Commander Mode</h3><figure style="width: 480px" data-align="right" data-size="medium" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11986/2497511-bf4+commander+mode.png" data-ref-id="1300-2497511" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11986/2497511-bf4+commander+mode.png" data-ref-id="1300-2497511"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11986/2497511-bf4+commander+mode.png"></a><figcaption>Commander Mode is back in Battlefield 4</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Battlefield 4 also sees the return of Commander Mode, last seen in <a href="/battlefield-2/3030-16866/" data-ref-id="3030-16866">Battlefield 2</a>. In this mode, the player (who does not take up a spot on their team's leaderboard) provides aid to their team through intelligence and offensive support. Additionally, the Commander can select any player on their team and see a picture-in-picture view of that player's screen. This mode can even be played using mobile devices without connecting to the game via console or PC. Commander Mode is available only in Conquest, Rush, and Obliteration game modes.</p><h3>Classes</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Battlefield 4 retains the same four classes as the previous game, with a few alterations in available capabilities &amp; gadgets:</p><ul><li><strong>Assault:</strong> Largely the same as before, the assault class carries assault rifles &amp; medical packs, with the option of carrying <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/defibrillator/3055-3443/" data-ref-id="3055-3443">defibrillators</a> or grenade/smoke launchers.</li><li><strong>Engineer:</strong> The engineer's exclusive weapon class has been changed to PDWs instead of carbines. This class is again the anti-vehicle class, with the ability to carry RPGs and mines.</li><li><strong>Support:</strong> On top of ammo packs, <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/c4/3055-896/" data-ref-id="3055-896">C4</a>, and <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/claymore/3055-1272/" data-ref-id="3055-1272">claymores</a>, the support class also has remote controlled mortars available. They also have an increased ability for suppressive fire than the other classes.</li><li><strong>Recon:</strong> This class now has C4 and claymores available to them, as well as throwable motion sensors (last seen in Bad Company 2.) They also have the new ability to adjust sniper scopes to compensate for distance, known as "zeroing".</li></ul><h3>Game Modes</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">There are 7 game modes available at launch. Five return from Battlefield 3, with two new modes (Obliteration and Defuse) introduced.</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Mode</th><th scope="col">Player Count (X360, PS3)</th><th scope="col">Player Count (XOne, PS4, PC)</th><th scope="col">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="//www.giantbomb.com/conquest-mode/3015-1099/" data-ref-id="3015-1099">Conquest</a></td><td><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">26</p></td><td><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">66</p></td><td>The classic Battlefield game mode where teams battle for control of flags on the map, with the team that holds less flags bleeding respawn tickets.

Players can be revived one time before they are permanently removed from the round.</td></tr></tbody></table><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">* On the PC, server admins can choose to override the player cap in some game modes, up to a hard limit of 64 players (+ 2 Commanders.)</p><h3>Maps</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">There are ten maps available at launch. All game modes are playable on all the maps:</p><ul><li><strong>Dawnbreaker</strong> - A map that takes place just before dawn in and around the streets of an urban landscape. As time progresses, the sun comes up, and players can trigger underground gas pipes to explode and destroy the boulevard.</li><li><strong>Flood Zone</strong> - Another city map, this one allows for much of the fighting to occur along the rooftops. Players can destroy a levee and flood the streets, pushing the fighting to higher ground.</li><li><strong>Golmud Railway</strong> - A large, open prairie with a railway running through it, this map allows players to detonate IEDs causing large explosions in the open field. In conquest, one of the control points is a moving traincar.</li><li><strong>Hainan Resort</strong> - This map takes place in and around a large hotel in along a tropical coast. The large hotel in the middle can have either side collapsed</li><li><strong>Lancang Dam</strong> - A coastal expanse that features a large defunct dam, which can be collapsed with explosives, creating a deadly avalanche of debris.</li><li><strong>Operation Locker</strong> - A mostly indoor map through an abandoned prison, this map features lockable cell doors and a collapsable guard tower located in the center of the complex.</li><li><strong>Paracel Storm</strong> - This map is a series of islands that features destroyed warships to battle for. As time progresses, a large tropical storm rolls through, and players can unleash a destroyer ship to crash into one of the islands.</li><li><strong>Rogue Transmission</strong> - This map features a huge satellite to fight over and under. Players can destroy the cables holding the telescope over the dish, sending it toppling into the center.</li><li><strong>Siege of Shanghai</strong> - This map is another large urban environment, which features a huge skyscraper in the middle with a capture point on top. By exploding the supports of this building, players can send the entire structure crashing to the ground, creating a new control point.</li><li><strong>Zavod 311</strong> - This map centers around an abandoned tank factory, and if players can find a computer they can arm and detonate a warhead, which will send a large smokestack tumbling to the ground.</li></ul><h3>Battlepacks</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Battlepacks are an additional way to unlock items in multiplayer. They are awarded at set intervals by leveling up both soldiers and weapons. Much like the weapon packs in <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/mass-effect-3/3030-29935/" data-ref-id="3030-29935">Mass Effect 3</a>, items granted in Battlepacks are randomized. The items awarded are weapon attachments such as scopes and silencers, as well as cosmetic variants of accessories such as new knives, dog tags, soldier camouflages, weapon/vehicle paints, experience boosts, and more.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Items contained in Battlepacks have three levels of <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/color-coded-loot/3015-4702/" data-ref-id="3015-4702">color-coded</a> rarity; Standard (grey), Advanced (white), Superior (blue), &amp; Distinguished (orange).</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">There are three tiers of Battlepacks; Bronze, Silver, &amp; Gold, as well as black Weapon Packs. The Bronze Pack will contain three items: two Standard ones, and one that has a chance of being Advanced. The quantity and rarity of the items increase in the Silver and Gold Packs. The Weapon Pack is aimed specifically at the noted weapon and provides weapon accessories for that weapon.</p><h2>Downloadable Content</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">There are five expansion packs for Battlefield 4 that feature new maps, game modes, weapons, and more. Each expansion will be available individually for purchase, or can be bought in a <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/dlc-season-pass/3015-7186/" data-ref-id="3015-7186">bundle</a> with a membership to Battlefield Premium.</p><h3>China Rising</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The first expansion pack to be released was China Rising. It features the maps Silk Road, Altai Range, Guilin Peaks, and Dragon Pass, four large open area maps set in Mainland China. The Air Superiority Mode is also made available in this expansion, as well as new vehicles and weapons.</p><h3>Second Assault</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The second expansion is Second Assault, which takes four maps from Battlefield 3 (Operation Metro, Caspian Border, Gulf of Oman, &amp; Operation Firestorm) and updates them in the new Frostbite 3 engine. A new game mode of Capture the Flag is available in this expansion as well.</p><h3>Naval Strike</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The third expansion, made available in March 2014, is Naval Strike. It features water-based combat on four new maps; Lost Islands, Nansha Strike, Wave Breaker, and Operation Mortar. Naval Strike also introduces five new weapons as well as a new hovercraft vehicle. The new game mode Carrier Assault is an homage to the "Titan" game mode from Battlefield 2142.</p><h3>Dragon's Teeth</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The fourth expansion is called Dragons' Teeth, which is focused on much more close combat situations. The four maps included are Lumphini Garden, Pearl Market, Propaganda, &amp; Sunken Dragon. It features 5 new weapons, and opens up a ballistic shield gadget for the Support class. The new game mode is called Chain Link, which is a variation of Conquest where players must capture adjacent flags in order to reduce the other teams tickets.</p><h3>Final Stand</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The fifth expansion features four new maps set in Russia.</p><h2>Pre-Unveiling</h2><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39388/2456720-bf4_unveil_invite_metreon_sf.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2456720" data-ratio="1.3327868852459" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:133.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39388/2456720-bf4_unveil_invite_metreon_sf.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2456720"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/39388/2456720-bf4_unveil_invite_metreon_sf.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/39388/2456720-bf4_unveil_invite_metreon_sf.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The game was revealed during a promotion for <a href="/medal-of-honor-warfighter/3030-37580/" data-ref-id="3030-37580">Medal of Honor: Warfighter</a>, allowing beta access to those who pre-order Warfighter, or purchase the Limited Edition.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">At a company meeting on February 19, 2013, store managers and CEO of Gamestop were given a <a href="https://twitter.com/GameStop/status/303993777167667200" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">sneak peak</a> of Battlefield 4.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Media were sent an invite via email on March 15th, 2013, to an unveiling event hosted at AMC Metreon in San Francisco.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">On March 20th, 2013, EA created a teaser site that would slowly show artwork from the game as more members logged into the site.

His drive move is known as Spiral which transforms his scarf into a drill used to fight against opponents.</p><h3><a href="/azrael/3005-24029/" data-ref-id="3005-24029">Azrael</a></h3><p style="">A member of Sector Seven with inordinately high strength, he seeks out worthy adversaries and will attack anyone on the battlefield, friend or foe, to quench his thirst for battle. His drive move is known as The Terror which points out weak points when attacking the opponent.</p><h3><a href="/bullet/3005-24030/" data-ref-id="3005-24030">Bullet</a></h3><p style="">Part of a mercenary group that looks to oppose Sector Seven. She was raised and trained by the mercenary group from a young age so she fights from battlefield to battlefield. When her entire squad was wiped out, she decided to travel the world and find the one responsible to avenge their deaths. Her drive move is known as Lock On, allowing her to quickly target her opponent and grab them.</p><h3>Izayoi</h3><p style="">The "True Form" of Tsubaki Yayoi after breaking free from the Imperator's control by releasing the powers within her Sealed Weapon, Izayoi. Her drive is Scarlet Justice, which increases the speed and power of all her special attacks in "Gain Art Mode."</p><h3>Kagura Mitsuki</h3><p style="">Known as "The Black Gale" or "The Black Knight." The leader of the Imperator's Palace Guard, the supreme general of the NOL, and the head of the powerful Mutsuki family within the Duodecim. Kagura seeks to take the Imperator's position and become head of the Library himself. Carries a giant sword and can throw mini-black holes at enemies.</p><h3>Yuuki Terumi</h3><p style="">One of The Six Heroes long before he was trapped within The Boundary and became the man known as Hazama. A much faster and more sadistic version of Hazama with less range, but not to be taken lightly.</p><h3>Kokonoe</h3><p style="">The daughter of the Heroes <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/jubei/3005-11517/" data-ref-id="3005-11517">Jubei</a> and Nine. Capable of summoning a jet hammer and similar items from hammerspace to attack her enemy.</p><p style=""> </p><h2>Returning Characters</h2><ul><li><a href="/arakune/3005-7858/" data-ref-id="3005-7858">Arakune</a></li><li><a href="/bang-shishigami/3005-7860/" data-ref-id="3005-7860">Bang Shishigami</a></li><li><a href="/carl-clover/3005-7859/" data-ref-id="3005-7859">Carl Clover</a></li><li><a href="/hakumen/3005-11514/" data-ref-id="3005-11514">Hakumen</a></li><li><a href="/hazama/3005-11516/" data-ref-id="3005-11516">Hazama</a></li><li><a href="/iron-tager/3005-7856/" data-ref-id="3005-7856">Iron Tager</a></li><li><a href="/jin-kisaragi/3005-7855/" data-ref-id="3005-7855">Jin Kisaragi</a></li><li><a href="/v-13/3005-11515/" data-ref-id="3005-11515">Nu-13</a></li><li><a href="/litchi-faye-ling/3005-7607/" data-ref-id="3005-7607">Litchi Faye Ling</a></li><li><a href="/makoto-nanaya/3005-13475/" data-ref-id="3005-13475">Makoto Nanaya</a></li><li><a href="/mu-12/3005-22374/" data-ref-id="3005-22374">Mu-12</a></li><li><a href="/noel-vermillion/3005-7803/" data-ref-id="3005-7803">Noel Vermillion</a></li><li><a href="/platinum-the-trinity/3005-15848/" data-ref-id="3005-15848">Platinum the Trinity</a></li><li><a href="/rachel-alucard/3005-7821/" data-ref-id="3005-7821">Rachel Alucard</a></li><li><a href="/ragna-the-bloodedge/3005-7830/" data-ref-id="3005-7830">Ragna the Bloodedge</a></li><li><a href="/relius-clover/3005-16619/" data-ref-id="3005-16619">Relius Clover</a></li><li><a href="/taokaka/3005-7608/" data-ref-id="3005-7608">Taokaka</a></li><li><a href="/tsubaki-yayoi/3005-12480/" data-ref-id="3005-12480">Tsubaki Yayoi</a></li><li><a href="/valkenhayn-hellsing/3005-15849/" data-ref-id="3005-15849">Valkenhayn R.

The game was originally a first-person game that used the <a href="/playstation-move/3000-36/" data-ref-id="3000-36">Playstation Move</a> controller to control flashlights and guns. In this original version, players were able to switch between eight playable characters at will.</p><p style="">The game was originally set to launch in 2013, but missed this window. At this point, the game had not been shown since its reveal. After rumors spread about the game's supposed cancellation, Supermassive Games <a href="http://www.videogamer.com/ps3/until_dawn/news/has_until_dawn_been_cancelled.html" rel="nofollow">confirmed</a> it was still in development and would launch at a later date.</p><p style="">Until Dawn was re-revealed at <a href="/gamescom-2014/3015-8493/" data-ref-id="3015-8493">Gamescom 2014</a> as a third-person Playstation 4 game. This new version is an exploration based game in the same vein as <a href="/heavy-rain/3030-21304/" data-ref-id="3030-21304">Heavy Rain</a> and utilizes the <a href="/killzone-shadow-fall/3030-41690/" data-ref-id="3030-41690">Killzone: Shadow Fall</a> engine. The character switching mechanic was scrapped in favor having characters become playable in different sections of the game. The Playstation Move support was replaced by the the <a href="/dualshock-4/3000-42/" data-ref-id="3000-42">Dualshock 4's</a> motion sensor. Developers said the extra development time and the platform switch was used to make the game "darker and fundamentally more terrifying."</p><p style="">On July 31st, 2015, Sony announced the game had been completed. It was released on August 25th of that year. </p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>39358</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/0/3699/2805496-until+dawn+v6.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3699/2805496-until+dawn+v6.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/0/3699/2805496-until+dawn+v6.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3699/2805496-until+dawn+v6.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/3699/2805496-until+dawn+v6.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3699/2805496-until+dawn+v6.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/0/3699/2805496-until+dawn+v6.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Until Dawn]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-16/]]></api_detail_url><id>16</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: M]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-37/]]></api_detail_url><id>37</id><name><![CDATA[PEGI: 18+]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-34/]]></api_detail_url><id>34</id><name><![CDATA[CERO: Z]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2015-08-25 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/]]></api_detail_url><id>146</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 4]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS4]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/until-dawn/3030-39358/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-39452/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2012-08-20 18:55:19</date_added><date_last_updated>2015-09-19 03:10:49</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[A top-down action combat game with an 80s aesthetic, a brutal style, and a thoughtful, slightly surreal philosophy underlying the story about the nature of violence.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4992/2297694-hotline_miami___gamescom_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2297694" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.62086956521739" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4992/2297694-hotline_miami___gamescom_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2297694"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4992/2297694-hotline_miami___gamescom_1.jpg"></a><figcaption>The protagonist using an enemy as a human shield whilst shooting at another.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Set in the neon-soaked underground of the 1980s, Hotline Miami is a surreal tale of blood, guns and masks.

It was developed by <a href="/dennaton/3010-8225/" data-ref-id="3010-8225"> Dennaton</a>, a collaboration between designer <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/jonatan-soderstrom/3040-103165/" data-ref-id="3040-103165">Jonatan Söderström</a> and artist <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/dennis-wedin/3040-103182/" data-ref-id="3040-103182">Dennis Wedin</a>.</p><p style="">Hotline Miami features over 20 levels and features 35 unique weapons.

The player is a nameless, silent protagonist. Each mission begins at the player's apartment, with a message on the answering machine. After receiving the location of your job you walk out to your <a href="/delorean-dmc-12/3055-403/" data-ref-id="3055-403"> DeLorean</a> and are transported to the level where the action takes place.</p><p style="">The player must choose a mask to wear at the start of each level. These masks are fashioned after animals and confer bonuses to the player such as faster walking, further viewing distance, or the ability to start the level with a weapon already in hand. Each mask is named and they can be unlocked by a combination of high scores and as pick ups within the missions themselves.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4992/2297696-hotline_miami___gamescom_3.png" data-ref-id="1300-2297696" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.56059421422987" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4992/2297696-hotline_miami___gamescom_3.png" data-ref-id="1300-2297696"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4992/2297696-hotline_miami___gamescom_3.png"></a><figcaption>The game features copious amounts of blood.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Most missions are two level buildings, a series of rooms filled with criminals and guard dogs, all of whom the player must kill to progress, however both the player and the enemy can kill and be killed with a single hit. The player can use any method within their means to kill each enemy, including but not limited to, a barehanded knockdown, a one hit kill from any of the games melee weapons, impalement from a throwing knife or at a distance with one of the game's many firearms. Any weapon in the game can be picked up and used to either attack or be thrown, inflicting a kill or <a href="/knock-back/3015-1912/" data-ref-id="3015-1912">knock down</a> depending on the type of weapon and which part of it hits the enemy. If an enemy is knocked-down the player must approach and finish them. This can mean embedding a <a href="/katana/3055-690/" data-ref-id="3055-690">katana</a> into their head, cutting their throat, or bashing their brains out with a bat. Each kill is rewarded with points which contribute to the player's level score.</p><p style="">Hotline Miami combines elements of stealth gameplay (silent kills, line of sight, alerting enemies to the player's presence) with rapid arcade style action. Whenever the player is killed, a quick press of the R button returns them to the beginning of the floor; it's not uncommon for a life to last but a few seconds. This absence of hit points and the very fast reaction time of the enemy AI means that every encounter must be dealt with a combination of planning and reflexive response, giving the gameplay a distinct flow. Upon clearing the whole building the music dies down and the player can safely backtrack through their trail of carnage to return to the entrance and complete the chapter. Finally, the player's level points are accumulated and tallied, and the player is then given a grade score for the level, which may unlock a mask or weapon if high enough.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align="left" data-size="medium" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/15/158679/2434941-hm_dream.png" data-ref-id="1300-2434941" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/15/158679/2434941-hm_dream.png" data-ref-id="1300-2434941"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/15/158679/2434941-hm_dream.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/15/158679/2434941-hm_dream.png"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Hotline Miami takes place in 1989 throughout the titular city of Miami, Florida. The player assumes the role of a nameless <a href="/anti-hero/3015-424/" data-ref-id="3015-424">anti-hero</a>--officially nicknamed as '<a href="/jacket/3005-29309/" data-ref-id="3005-29309">Jacket</a>'--starting the game in a derelict basement, being instructed in the finer points of murder by a homeless man. After a vague, dreamlike confrontation with a trio of masked individuals, the player is thrust into a flashback of his "first encounter" with the rooster mask and the game begins in earnest. It is not clear how stable the main character's mind is throughout the game; now and then he will appear to hallucinate and see characters whose jaws are barely hanging on or who have bullet holes in their faces. The game implies that everything you are seeing is on a VHS tape which is periodically fast-forward, rewound, and mysteriously edited.</p><p style="">The story develops in various ways as each mission unfolds. The player glimpses portions of the story through the environmental details of Jacket's home, the newspaper clippings of Jacket's exploits, the messages left on Jacket's machine, and the post-mission payment pick-ups in the form of some free goods at one of four rotating businesses (including a VHS Rental and Pizzeria). Through these glimpses it ultimately becomes clear that the criminals Jacket kills each night are affiliated with the Russian Mafia. Discovering who is providing the work and ordering the hits remains the primary story goal of the game up to and beyond the final chapter.</p><h3>Endings</h3><p style="">Hotline Miami has three separate endings. The first is the resolution of the main character's story. After completing the 15th chapter and defeating the (supposed) <a href="/final-boss/3015-1537/" data-ref-id="3015-1537">final boss</a> there is a cut-scene and the credits sequence begins. Then the tape rewinds, and three more missions that task the player to find out who is behind the answering machine messages become available. The twist comes in that the player is now controlling a character who had been previously encountered as a boss. Completing these chapters and defeating another boss will unlock the second ending. The third ending can be seen by using a computer terminal in chapter 19 and inputting a password. This password is gained by collecting the letters (signified by small purple pixels with a white dot in the center) in each level and placing them in order in the pause menu "Puzzle" screen. Once unlocked this password will automatically be entered into the terminal on the next play through and award the final ending.</p><h3>Chapters</h3><ul><li>Metro (Prelude)</li><li>No Talk (Chapter One)</li><li>Overdose (Chapter Two)</li><li>Decadence (Chapter Three)</li><li>Tension (Chapter Four)</li><li>Full House (Chapter Five)</li><li>Clean Hit (Chapter Six)</li><li>Neighbors (Chapter Seven)</li><li>Push It (Chapter Eight)</li><li>Crackdown (Chapter Nine)</li><li>Hot &amp; Heavy (Chapter Ten)</li><li>Deadline (Chapter Eleven)</li><li>Trauma (Chapter Twelve)</li><li>Assault (Chapter Thirteen)</li><li>Vengeance (Chapter Fourteen)</li><li>Showdown (Final Chapter)</li><li>Safehouse (Chapter Sixteen)</li><li>Fun &amp; Games (Chapter Seventeen)</li><li>Prank Call (Chapter Eighteen)</li><li>Resolution (Chapter Nineteen)</li><li>Highball (Bonus Chapter)</li><li>Exposed (Special Chapter)</li></ul><h2>Masks</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/32858/2365204-02_rasmus.png" data-ref-id="1300-2365204" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/32858/2365204-02_rasmus.png" data-ref-id="1300-2365204"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/32858/2365204-02_rasmus.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/32858/2365204-02_rasmus.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>The mask selection menu.</figcaption></figure><p style="">There are 26 masks available in the game.

series.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams is a 2D platformer that is the third entry in the <a href="/giana-sisters/3025-1289/" data-ref-id="3025-1289">Giana Sisters</a> series. The game was created by <a href="/black-forest-games/3010-8302/" data-ref-id="3010-8302">Black Forest Game</a> which is made up of key members from the <a href="/giana-sisters-ds/3030-25757/" data-ref-id="3030-25757">Giana Sisters DS</a> development team from the now bankrupted <a href="/spellbound-entertainment-ag/3010-749/" data-ref-id="3010-749">Spellbound Entertainment</a>. Twisted Dreams was funded through <a href="/kickstarter-funded/3015-7378/" data-ref-id="3015-7378">Kickstarter</a> and was released for the <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC</a> on October 23, 2012. <a href="/playstation-network-ps3/3045-88/" data-ref-id="3045-88">PSN</a>, <a href="/xbox-live-marketplace/3045-86/" data-ref-id="3045-86">Xbox Live Arcade,</a> and <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/wii-u/3045-139/" data-ref-id="3045-139">Wii U</a> eShop ports followed afterwards. <a href="/xbox-one/3045-145/" data-ref-id="3045-145">Xbox One</a> and <a href="/playstation-4/3045-146/" data-ref-id="3045-146">PlayStation 4</a> version are set to release in December of 2014 these version will include all of the original game's content along with the previously PC-exclusive Rise of the Owlverlord and Halloween Level expansion packs.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style="">Giana's sister, Maria, has been kidnapped by a dragon, which has come to be the series' main antagonist. She follows her into the Dream World where she's able to transform between "good"/"cute" and "bad"/"punk" versions of herself. The environment, playstyle and enemies all directly reflect the opposite version of what form Giana current is in. When playing as "cute" Giana she's only able to jump and swirl along long trenches, as with "punk" Giana she's able to hurl herself as a fireball into enemies that are susceptible to defeat. This "twist" mechanic is one of the core fundaments throughout the entire game.</p><h2>Enemies</h2><p style="">Giana is able to take out enemies several ways. The regular jump on top of them works in both forms, but it doesn't take them out entirely. Giana's "punk" mode allows her to fireball herself into enemies, taking them out for the duration of the level or until she perishes and sent back to the previous checkpoint. Some enemies are however armored and require a different approach all together. Spiked enemies are invulnerable and must be avoided, while some presents themselves in a different form based on what version Giana is playing as.</p><h2>Extras</h2><p style="">Found under the "Extras" in the game's main menu, additional levels and content updates can be accessed. These are automatically updated for users that have the game on Steam and GoG, as well as backers versions of the game. So far Black Forest Games have provided owners of the game with two content updates in form of new levels.</p><p style=""><b>Halloween special:</b> On 30th October 2012, a free Halloween themed level was introduced. It is a rehash of one of the existing levels, Enchanted Mountain Path, but adds various Halloween themed objects to the game, along with naturally alot more ghosts to boot. Giana also has a pumpkin mask on her head covering her entire face.</p><p style=""><b>Christmas special:</b> Early December 2012 a free Christmas themed level was added. It features snow-covered environments with several holiday-themed objects where Giana can meet and fight off Santa-Owls. The maximum number of gems possible to acquire here is 750. Additionally, it features lava and snow.

It is complete with a directional microphone that can hear conversations. The binoculars also allow Snake to mark enemies and track their movement on the map and see them through walls depending on how close they are to the player. The player can also hit a button and have Kaz chime in on anything that the binoculars are pointed at, providing some more back story to the base and its soldiers.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Another new mechanic is the reflex mode. If the player is spotted the game will go into slow motion for around five seconds allowing the player to take down the guard that spotted him depending on how far or visible he is. If they fail to do so the entire base will enter alert status and soldiers will begin to converge on the player's position.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Snake has most of the moves players are accustomed to with a few differences. He can aim in all directions while prone by rotating his body as well as perform a combat dive to get out of sticky situations and into nearby cover. Snake will automatically stick to walls and low cover completely removing the need to keep holding the directional button in order to stay hidden. He can also use <a href="/close-quarters-combat/3015-865/" data-ref-id="3015-865">CQC</a> from cover and disarm enemies by using the correct order of button presses.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">During a mission, Snake can drop a flare grenade to signal a helicopter that can be used to retrieve hostages or abort the mission. After the landing zone is selected the helicopter plays a tune chosen by the player when approaching (e.g Heavens Divide or Ride of the Valkyries), though if the tune is too loud, or if the helicopter is too close to enemies, it can be shot down. It can also trigger a full alert status on the base depending on the chosen landjng zone but will not penalize the player´s stealth ranking, because enemies have spotted the helicopter and not Snake.</p><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/89459/2307936-1droid.png" data-ref-id="1300-2307936" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/89459/2307936-1droid.png" data-ref-id="1300-2307936"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/89459/2307936-1droid.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/89459/2307936-1droid.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>The iDroid Device</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Snake also carries with him an iDroid, a <a href="/hologram/3015-3695/" data-ref-id="3015-3695">holographic projection</a> device that is used to display the map and mission information, as well as allowing him to call in for a helicopter to rescue both prisoners or to extract himself from the base—all of this taking place outside of the pause menu in real time.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The game also features day/night cycles which enhance replay value by mixing up enemy patrol patterns as well as altering how far away guards will spot you, which in turn forces you to play differently.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Knocking on walls is no longer possible, but players can throw empty magazines in order to replicate the effect. Weapons have accessories that can be toggled on and off, such as suppressors and flash-lights. All suppressors—with the exception of the tranquilizer pistol—will eventually break with usage.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Tranquilizer shots no longer affect targets immediately when hit in the heart or genitals: only head shots instantly knocks out guards. The amount of shots below the neck will determine the delay of him going unconscious: one shot will take 30 seconds to take effect, two shots will take 10 seconds, 3 shots will take a guard down after 2 seconds, and 4 shots below the neck equal a head shot and take a guard out instantly.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Almost all of the story in Ground Zeroes is explained via <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/audio-cassette/3055-4054/" data-ref-id="3055-4054">cassette tapes</a>, which the player can collect in Side-Ops and the Main Mission. These can be accessed either in game via the Sony Walkman or in the main menu. These audio recordings provide many smaller details concerning the events leading up to the Ground Zeroes mission and the characters that play a role in the main story. Several of these cassettes also serve as a recap of the events in <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater/3030-18082/" data-ref-id="3030-18082">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a> and <a href="/metal-gear-solid-peace-walker/3030-26817/" data-ref-id="3030-26817">Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker</a>.</p><h3 style="margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;">Bonus Missions</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Along with the main story mission, there are six additional bonus missions that can be unlocked.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Like the main mission, players are scored at the end of each mission by several factors (including time spent, number of enemies killed, and number of alerts).

Chico divulges key information, such as the number of troops and the base's location out at sea, but most importantly he reveals the existence of Metal Gear ZEKE. He then tries to convince Paz to talk as well, but to no avail.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">After enduring more torture, Paz eventually reveals the location of Cipher to Skull Face, who plans to eliminate him once and for all. His reasons for wanting this are not revealed.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Kaz and Snake are both worried that Paz might reveal the truth about <em>MSF</em> and Metal Gear ZEKE. To complicate matters further, the UN (with US forces) is due to inspect Mother Base for nuclear weapons in order to determine whether or not MSF poses a real threat to the world.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">This inspection is forced upon them by <a href="/huey-emmerich/3005-12516/" data-ref-id="3005-12516">Huey Emmerich</a>, who, behind Kaz's and Boss' back, reached out to the UN and retracted Boss' initial response to "respectfully decline" the inspection.

All he can hope is that Chico is still alive and that Paz can be recovered for questioning. Unfortunately, the inspection team will be arriving the night he leaves for the prison camp, and Kaz warns Snake that he will be on his own without MSF backup for this mission.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Snake arrives quietly at the base and manages to rescue Chico, who becomes terrified and aggressive upon seeing Snake. Snake subdues Chico and carries him to the extraction point. Before Chico is extracted, he remarks that Paz is dead and gives Snake a cassette tape to prove it—this tape is a recording of Paz's torture and supposed death. Listening to the tape, Snake uses audio clues to deduce where Paz is being held and makes his way to the boiler room of the prison camp. There he finds Paz still alive and bound in chains. Snake frees her and carries her out for evacuation via helicopter. While en route to Mother Base, it is discovered that a live bomb was surgically implanted into Paz's abdomen by removing some of her organs in order to fit; it is promptly removed by the medic inside the helicopter and thrown into the sea by Snake.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Snake arrives back at Mother Base to find it under heavy attack—the inspection team was actually a ruse designed to give an enemy assault force access to the base. Snake attempts to rally his forces and fight back, but he is forced to extract with Kaz and fly away as the base explodes and crumbles into the ocean. Kaz is visibly shaken after witnessing the loss of Mother Base and lashes out at Paz, who he sees as the main culprit—he does not yet know that it was in fact Chico that gave XOF the intelligence about Mother Base. Snake and the others are closely pursued by enemy helicopters, which seem to be under the orders of XOF.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Paz then awakes and stands up in fright, stating that there is a bomb implanted in her body. Snake tries to calm her down by saying that it had been removed, but as this is being said Paz opens the door and reveals that an additional bomb was also implanted inside of her. She then throws herself out of the chopper in an attempt to save Snake and the others, but the bomb goes off when she is just outside the door, causing the chopper to lose control and collide with a pursuing enemy helicopter.

The trailer was as much of a reveal of Ground Zeroes as it was for FOX Engine. The setting for the footage was Camp Omega during a rainy night, showing <a href="/rain/3015-3077/" data-ref-id="3015-3077">rain</a> and <a href="/wind/3015-6208/" data-ref-id="3015-6208">wind</a> effects. Also detailed was plot points for the game, and Snake's objective at the facility.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Shortly after PAX Prime 2012, Kojima tweeted that Ground Zeroes is not what was known as Project Ogre, another "open world" game on the FOX Engine. Project Ogre was later revealed to be Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain.</p><h2>Reception</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Ground Zeroes received overall positive reviews, averaging <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/metal-gear-solid-v-ground-zeroes" rel="nofollow">75</a>, <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/metal-gear-solid-v-ground-zeroes" rel="nofollow">76</a>, and <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-ground-zeroes" rel="nofollow">80 </a>Metacritic scores for the Playstation 4, Xbox One, and PC versions of the game respectively. The game was praised consistently for its graphical fidelity and gameplay mechanics, providing an immersive espionage experience: "[w]ith Ground Zeroes’ minimal HUD, a narrow third-person camera angle, and a sprawling base filled with potential threats, sneaking behind enemy lines has rarely felt so tense and immersive," <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metal-gear-solid-5-ground-zeroes-review/1900-6415701/">said Gamespot staff member Peter Brown in his March 18, 2014 review</a>. The game was also praised by some outlets for its exploration of various political themes, particularly the imprisonment of war criminals in "black site" prison camps akin to Camp Omega. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/20/metal-gear-solid-5-ground-zeroes" rel="nofollow">Reviewer Rich Stanton elaborated on this point in his March 20, 2014 Guardian review</a>: "...as the repeating structure and evolving narrative are at pains to point out, black sites like this and their grey legal status are a tribute to bureaucracy's unerring ability to triumph over ethics and what is 'right' - just ask President Obama. If Kafka was alive today he'd be writing about Guantanamo, but instead we have Hideo Kojima and an irony; a medium predicated on interaction, a game about tactical espionage action, with an overarching theme of political inaction."</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The overarching criticism of Ground Zeroes was the length of its primary story-based mission, which could be completed in less than one hour. This led many to compare the game to a playable demo, which, when paired with its original price point of $40, led many to label the game as a "<a href="http://www.polygon.com/2014/3/18/5519578/metal-gear-solid-5-ground-zeroes-review" rel="nofollow">cash grab</a>." <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/reviews/11133-Metal-Gear-Solid-V-Ground-Zeroes-Review-Snake-Oil.2" rel="nofollow">Reviewer Jim Sterling stated the following in his Escapist Magazine review</a>: "The problem is, <em>Ground Zeroes</em> truly, honestly, does not feel like much of a game. Not a complete one. Not a full product, worthy of charging money." Konami responded to these criticisms on February 24, 2014 by reducing the cost of the Playstation 4 and Xbox One versions of the fame to $30, which was equivalent to the price tags of the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 versions.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>39575</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/82063/2578540-mgsvgz.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82063/2578540-mgsvgz.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/82063/2578540-mgsvgz.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2578540-mgsvgz.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/82063/2578540-mgsvgz.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/82063/2578540-mgsvgz.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/82063/2578540-mgsvgz.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-16/]]></api_detail_url><id>16</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: M]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-12/]]></api_detail_url><id>12</id><name><![CDATA[OFLC: MA15+]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-13/]]></api_detail_url><id>13</id><name><![CDATA[OFLC: M15+]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2014-03-18 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-86/]]></api_detail_url><id>86</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360 Games Store]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360-games-store/3045-86/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[XBGS]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-88/]]></api_detail_url><id>88</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation Network (PS3)]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-network-ps3/3045-88/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3N]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-145/]]></api_detail_url><id>145</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox One]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-one/3045-145/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[XONE]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/]]></api_detail_url><id>146</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 4]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS4]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/metal-gear-solid-v-ground-zeroes/3030-39575/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-39576/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2012-08-30 02:26:43</date_added><date_last_updated>2015-01-15 17:13:39</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[From the developer of SpaceChem, Ironclad Tactics is a realtime tactical card game set in an alternate-historical version of the American Civil War in which steam-powered robots rule the battlefield.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Ironclad Tactics is a realtime tactical card game made by <a href="/zachtronics-industries/3010-7484/" data-ref-id="3010-7484">Zachtronics Industries</a>, known for their previous game, <a href="/spacechem/3030-34342/" data-ref-id="3030-34342">SpaceChem</a>.

The story focuses on Maxwell and Joseph, two brothers who work for United States Bureau of Steam Engineering, who helped to create the ironclads. They, along with their mentor and recruited compatriots, lead Ironclads for the North, and the battles take place across the United States. </p><h3> </h3><h2>System Requirements</h2><h3>PC</h3><ul><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows XP / Vista / 7 / 8</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 2.0 GHz</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2 GB RAM</li><li><strong>Hard Drive: </strong>700 MB available space</li></ul><h3>Mac</h3><ul><li><strong>OS:</strong> OS X 10.5.8, or later</li><li><strong>Processor: </strong>2.0 GHz</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2 GB RAM</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong> 700 MB available space</li></ul><h3>Linux</h3><ul><li><strong>OS: </strong>Ubuntu 12.04 LTS</li><li><strong>Processor: </strong>2.0 GHz</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2 GB RAM</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong> 700 MB available space</li></ul>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>39576</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/17/171291/2557158-7107997127-60ec4.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/17/171291/2557158-7107997127-60ec4.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/17/171291/2557158-7107997127-60ec4.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/17/171291/2557158-7107997127-60ec4.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/17/171291/2557158-7107997127-60ec4.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/17/171291/2557158-7107997127-60ec4.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/17/171291/2557158-7107997127-60ec4.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Ironclad Tactics]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating/><original_release_date>2013-09-18 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-17/]]></api_detail_url><id>17</id><name><![CDATA[Mac]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/mac/3045-17/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[MAC]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/]]></api_detail_url><id>146</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 4]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS4]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-152/]]></api_detail_url><id>152</id><name><![CDATA[Linux]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/linux/3045-152/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[LIN]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/ironclad-tactics/3030-39576/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-39593/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2012-08-30 21:48:48</date_added><date_last_updated>2015-10-11 03:06:36</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[Knock-Knock is a Kickstarter-funded adventure game by Russian developer Ice-Pick Lodge.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Knock-Knock is an horror themed adventure game developed and published by Ice Pick Lodge. The game has been devised by the developers from 19 mysterious files, sent to them by an unknown figure via email; they were asked to finish the project using the information stored in these files, with the only catch that they had to include everything in the files, but designing it was entirely up to them.</p><p style="">The aim of the game is to play what is essentially a game of hide and seek, but against unusual 'Guests' who have been visiting the house of a hermit - the player character. The aim of the game is to merely survive the night with your sanity intact. Beyond surviving, the "Lodger" as he's called in game, can also collect pages from his diary. These pages reveal certain elements of story and hints for the game's mechanics, but some of these notes also include strange rituals that refer to themselves as games which result in welcoming and communing with "guests". Through these cryptic notes and the Lodger's own monologues the player can try to deduce what is going on but the constant theme of insanity results in considerations for an <a

It is intended as the beginning of a franchise.</p><p style="">The game runs on a modified <a href="/id-tech-5/3015-1385/" data-ref-id="3015-1385">idTech 5 engine</a>.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Overview &amp; Controls</h3><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2474572-village_02_forsite.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2474572" data-ratio="0.56285714285714" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2474572-village_02_forsite.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2474572"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2474572-village_02_forsite.jpg"></a><figcaption>The Evil Within plays somewhat similarly to Resident Evil 4</figcaption></figure><p style="">Labelled as a 'pure' survival horror game by Shinji Mikami, The Evil Within is designed to strike a certain balance between horror and action elements. It greatly incorporates many elements of Mikami's previous work in Resident Evil 4 -- most notably how it plays from a third-person, over-the-shoulder perspective. Though unlike Resident Evil 4 The Evil Within is more of a standard shooter. One notable distinction is that there are no button-prompt melee attacks, though the player still has access to a punch that can knock enemies away. The actual damage it deals is minimal, however the player can also come upon torches and axes, which'll kill a regular enemy in one-hit, though they are also one-use only. While players can aim with the game's zoomed-in over-the-shoulder perspective, they can alternatively fire freely by pressing R2/RT (default PlayStation &amp; Xbox controls) without aiming with L2/LT. Much like in Resident Evil 4, players can choose between slowly opening a door or kicking it open; when kicking it open, it'll knock back any enemies that are on the other side.</p><p style="">Sebastian will soon have access to matches, which he can use to burn the bodies of downed Haunted creatures. This thusly allows the player to prematurely kill a Haunted after shooting it so it has fallen over, and even enemies that are lying in wait for a certain event to be triggered before getting up.</p><p style="">Unlike the survival horror games of old, The Evil Within is strictly linear and doesn't ever offer up a large environment for the player to explore at their leisure akin to the Spencer Mansion. However ammunition at least is difficult to come by, and players can only carry a certain amount of ammo per weapon. There are a sparse few puzzles dotted around the game, however they are relatively simple.</p><p style="">In an attempt to disassociate survival horror games with 'clunky', unintuitive controls, The Evil Within allows players to move and shoot at the same time, with full analogue control as opposed to <a href="/tank-controls/3015-4647/" data-ref-id="3015-4647">tank controls</a>. As in other recent horror games like <a href="/dead-space/3025-1229/" data-ref-id="3025-1229">Dead Space</a>, <a href="/heads-up-display/3015-180/" data-ref-id="3015-180">HUD </a>elements are kept to a minimum in the interest of immersion. What few HUD elements there are can also be turned off in the options.</p><p style="">Quick Time Events will be encountered across the game, though they're kept to a minimum and will primarily be required for turning valves and the like.</p><p style="">Throughout the game the player will encounter files they can read, which'll help provide backstory related to the current happenings in the game.</p><h3>Difficulty Levels</h3><p style="">The Evil Within features four difficulty levels:</p><ul><li>Casual -- Auto-aim is turned on for this mode.</li></ul><ul><li>Survival</li></ul><ul><li>Nightmare -- This difficulty level is unlocked upon completing the game.</li></ul><ul><li>Akumu -- which translates to ''Worst Dream'' in Japanese. This difficulty level must also be unlocked upon completing the game first. What makes it particularly notable over the lesser difficulties is that the player will die from a single hit.</li></ul><h3>Stealth</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2693563-10153831_945726572122092_5574949883651564270_n.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2693563" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2693563-10153831_945726572122092_5574949883651564270_n.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2693563"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2693563-10153831_945726572122092_5574949883651564270_n.jpg"></a><figcaption>Sebastian hiding around a corner from an enemy.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Beyond merely shooting enemies, the player also has access to stealth. However it is rather rudimentary and is primarily restricted to allowing the player to crouch-walk and then potentially nail a stealth kill on an unsuspecting enemy.</p><p style="">Players can at least throw bottles in an attempt to distract the creatures, and can also choose to hide inside closets and under beds. However the noise made from going inside or out of a hiding spot is louder than one may expect and can potentially attract nearby enemies to the player's position.</p><p style="">For the Casual and Survival difficulty settings, the player can choose to turn on an indicator that'll let the player know if they're hidden and when the enemy is made aware of their position.</p><h3>Traps</h3><p style="">The player will encounter many traps throughout the game, to which they are dangerous for both the player and the monsters that are patrolling the area. As such, the player could potentially use them to their advantage in fighting off enemies. Alternatively, the player can disarm them (most commonly by holding down X/A) to then collect parts they can use to build ammunition for the Agony Crossbow weapon.</p><p style="">The traps are as such:</p><ul><li><strong>Tripwire</strong> - They're typically tied to a stack of dynamite, instigating an explosion should someone cross it. However they may also sometimes function as an alarm, alerting any enemies within the vicinity.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Bear Trap</strong> - The most basic of the traps, if walked upon the player (or an enemy) will be temporarily stuck, and the player must wiggle the left analogue stick to escape.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Proximity Trap</strong> - This one will begin to rapidly beep once the player is near, and after so long will explode. Though it will not beep should the player be crouch-walking. It will not respond to any enemies, but can still be shot by the player to create an explosion. To disarm it the player must tap X/A at the right time when the arrow spins into the blue area; if it lands in the red it will explode, as it will should the arrow spin a whole 360 degrees.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Acid Trap</strong> - Later on in the game, acid traps are introduced. They function as two opposing tanks filled with acid, to which will continually spew out a puddle of it within its immediate area. It will not affect any enemies that walk past it.</li></ul><h3>Inventory</h3><p style="">Weapons and items are stored in a ring, and when opened will drastically slow down the process of time. From there the player can select an item to use, however they can also set an item onto each direction of the four-way d-pad for a more convenient method of switching between weapons and healing supplies.</p><h3>Health &amp; Healing</h3><p style="">There are two items the player can use to heal themselves -- syringes and medkits. Syringes will simply heal the player by a set amount, whereas a medkit will heal Sebastian fully while also slightly increasing his overall health. However upon using a medkit, this'll make Sebastian delirious for a few seconds, disallowing him from defending himself in any way.</p><p style="">Should Sebastian's health drop near the bottom, this'll slow his overall movement and stops him from being able to sprint. If the player stays still for a short while, his health will regenerate up to a certain point -- enough that he'll regain full mobility of movement.</p><h3>AI Partners</h3><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2693562-10527903_945816552113094_4806187310692493979_n.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2693562" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2693562-10527903_945816552113094_4806187310692493979_n.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2693562"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2693562-10527903_945816552113094_4806187310692493979_n.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2693562-10527903_945816552113094_4806187310692493979_n.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Sebastian and Joseph.</figcaption></figure><p style="">For the majority of the game Sebastian will be on his own, though on some few occasions he will be accompanied by a partner character. His detective partner Joseph Oda will be the most recurring partner character, and is usually brought in for the more action-oriented scenes of the game. Oda will have access to weapons of his own depending on the situation--he'll firstly use his own military pistol, then an axe at a later event--and can kill enemies. Oda isn't invincible, though he can withstand more punishment than the player. When standing next to him, the player can hold down the X/A buttons (default PlayStation &amp; Xbox controls) down for a few seconds to heal Oda completely.</p><p style="">Junior detective Juli Kidman may also be at the players side on occasion, though unlike Oda she is completely invincible; Kidman is also still able to kill any nearby enemies. During one occasion late in the game, the player will have both Oda and Kidman at their side to provide backup, both of whom are invincible this time around. Marcelo Jimenez and/or Leslie Withers on a few occasions will also tag along with Sebastian; they both have no means of attack, but also cannot die.</p><h3>Save Room</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2693560-10641104_945745505453532_3322120249620475468_n.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2693560" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2693560-10641104_945745505453532_3322120249620475468_n.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2693560"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2693560-10641104_945745505453532_3322120249620475468_n.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2693560-10641104_945745505453532_3322120249620475468_n.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>No typewriters necessary this time.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Throughout the game, the player will begin to hear Clair de lune by Claude Debussy, signalling that a Save Room is nearby. To enter the room the player will usually have to read the nearby journal of Sebastian's, which'll then crack the mirror allowing the player to enter. Sometimes the mirror will already be cracked, and the story itself will also sometimes force the player to return to the Save Room.</p><p style="">The Save Room itself is a ward of the Beacon Mental Hospital, currently being overseen by Nursa Tatiana. While there the player can of course save their progress, though further back is a metal chair the player can sit on to then upgrade their abilities with use of 'green gel', the game's currency. In the back is a series of lockers the player can unlock for some supplies, though they first require keys that can be found during the main game to unlock. The contents inside are random. Finally there is a map of Krimson City located in Tatiana's office, however it is missing a majority of its pieces that must be collected by the player to fill it in.</p><p style="">The game progresses throughout 15 separate chapters, each of which will allow the player to save before moving onto the next.</p><h3>Upgrades</h3><p style="">Note: The first increment is the base stat.</p><h4>General Abilities Upgrades</h4><ul><li><strong>Life Gauge Increase</strong> - 100 / 110 / 120 / 130 / 150</li><li><strong>Maximum Sprint Time Increase</strong> - 3.0s / 4.0s / 6.0s / 8.0s / 10.0s</li><li><strong>Melee Damage Increase</strong> - 100% / 120% / 150% / 180% / 240%</li><li><strong>Syringe Recovery Increase</strong> - 30 / 35 / 42 / 48 / 60</li></ul><h4>Revolver Upgrades</h4><ul><li><strong>Damage Multiplier</strong> - 100% / 120% / 140% / 160% / 200%</li><li><strong>Fire Rate</strong> - 1.00s / 0.80s / 0.65s / 0.50s / 0.30s</li><li><strong>Reload Time</strong> - 2.40s / 1.93s / 1.58s . 1.33s / 1.16s</li><li><strong>Clip Capacity</strong> - 6 / 7 / 8 / 9 / 12</li><li><strong>Accuracy</strong> - 5.0 / 4.5 / 4.0 / 3.5 / 2.5</li><li><strong>Critical Chance</strong> - 0% / +10% / +20% / +30% / +50%</li></ul><h4>Magnum Upgrades</h4><ul><li><strong>Damage Multiplier</strong> - 100% / 120% / 140% / 160% / 200%</li><li><strong>Fire Rate</strong> - 1.00s / 0.90s / 0.80s / 0.70s / 0.50s</li><li><strong>Reload Time</strong> - 2.40s / 1.93s / 1.58s / 1.33s / 1.16s</li><li><strong>Clip Capacity</strong> - 6 / 7 / 8 / 9 / 12</li><li><strong>Accuracy</strong> - 5.0 / 4.5 / 4.0 / 3.5 / 2.5</li></ul><h4>Shotgun Upgrades</h4><ul><li><strong>Damage Multiplier</strong> - 100% / 120% / 140% / 160% / 200%</li><li><strong>Fire Rate</strong> - 1.60s / 1.50s / 1.40s / 1.30s / 1.10s</li><li><strong>Reload Time</strong> - 3.16s / 2.30s / 1.81s / 1.58s / 1.27s</li><li><strong>Clip Capacity</strong> - 4 / 5 / 6 / 8 / 10</li><li><strong>Critical Chance</strong> - 0% / +10% / +20% / +30% / +50%</li></ul><h4>Sniper Rifle Upgrades</h4><ul><li><strong>Damage Multiplier</strong> - 100% / 120% / 140% / 160% / 200%</li><li><strong>Fire Rate</strong> - 1.60s / 1.30s / 1.10s / 1.00s / 0.80s</li><li><strong>Reload Time</strong> - 3.83s / 3.41s / 3.07s / 2.56s / 2.04s</li><li><strong>Clip Capacity</strong> - 5 / 6 / 7 / 8 / 10</li><li><strong>Critical Chance</strong> - 0% / +20% / +40% / +60% / +100%</li></ul><h4>Agony Crossbow Upgrades</h4><ul><li><strong>Charge Time</strong> - 1.0s / 0.67s / 0.33s</li><li><strong>Range</strong> - 100% / 120% / 150%</li><li><strong>Reload Time</strong> - 1.52s / 1.28s / 1.11s</li></ul><h4>Stock Upgrades</h4><ul><li><strong>Handgun</strong> - 10 / 15 / 20 / 25 / 50</li><li><strong>Magnum</strong> - 6 / 8 / 10 / 12 / 16</li><li><strong>Shotgun</strong> - 4 / 6 / 8 / 10 / 20</li><li><strong>Sniper Rifle</strong> - 5 / 6 / 8 / 10 / 15</li><li><strong>Agony Crossbow</strong> - 2 / 3 / 4</li><li><strong>Grenades</strong> - 3 / 4 / 5 / 6 / 10</li><li><strong>Syringes</strong> - 2 / 3 / 4</li><li><strong>Matches</strong> - 5 / 7 /10 / 15 / 30</li></ul><h4>Agony Bolt Upgrades</h4><ul><li><strong>Explosive Bolt Damage</strong> - 100% / 110% / 120% / 130% / 150%</li><li><strong>Shock Bolt Radius &amp; Duration</strong> - 1.2m, 4s / 1.5m, 4s / 1.5m, 6s / 2.0m, 6s / 2.5m, 10s</li><li><strong>Freeze Bolt Radius</strong> - 1.5m / 1.75m / 2.0m / 2.5m / 3.0m</li><li><strong>Flash Bolt Blindness Duration</strong> - 4s / 7s / 10s / 13s / 16s</li><li><strong>Harpoon Bolt Damage Multiplier</strong> - 100% / 130% / 160% / 240% / 240% + Fire Element</li></ul><h3>New Game+</h3><p style="">Whence the game has been completed, the player is then allowed to play any of the 15 chapters again with all of their unlocked weapons and upgrades.

While it at first functions as a regular crossbow that can shoot out harpoons, the player will soon come upon multiple varieties of ammunition. Ammo can be found throughout the world, though the player can also create their own ammo with 'parts', either by being found in the environment or from disarming enemy traps. Due to its variety of ammo types it is somewhat akin to the <a href="/grenade-launcher/3055-252/" data-ref-id="3055-252">grenade launcher </a>from the <a href="/resident-evil/3025-397/" data-ref-id="3025-397">Resident Evil</a> series.</p><h4>Agony Crossbow Bolt Types</h4><p style=""><strong>Harpoon Bolt </strong></p><p style="">The regular ammunition for the weapon.

Players can then shoot the enemy with other weaponry while they're stuck, though it's possible for the player to accidentally shoot the bolt that's lodged in the creature, allowing them to prematurely regain movement.</p><p style="">Four parts are required to make a Shock Bolt.</p><p style=""><strong>Incendiary Bolt</strong></p><p style="">This bolt type is only available to players via the Fighting Chance pack and cannot be upgraded in any way; players must also first reach Chapter 3 before they have access to it. An Incendiary bolt whence shot will spray a stream of short-range fire in three directions; when directly shot at an enemy, it will do no actual damage to the enemy it is lodged on, but will still spray outwards onto any nearby enemies.</p><p style="">Five parts are required to make an Incendiary Bolt.</p><p style=""><strong>Poison Bolt</strong></p><p style="">This bolt type is also only available to players via the Fighting Chance pack and cannot be upgraded in any way; players must also first reach Chapter 3 before they have access to it.

The most basic forms will utilise such weapons as axes, kitchen knives, torches, shovels and so on, if they're not simply unarmed. Shooting the Haunted's hand holding their weapon will make them drop it. If unarmed they'll typically try to grab Sebastian, requiring the player to wiggle the stick to escape their grasp. However if they have a weapon and get close enough they can potentially instigate an attack showing them attack Sebastian with their weapon that cannot be avoided.</p><p style="">Haunted will sometimes opt to throw their melee weapon at the player, and some will even arrive ready with molotov cocktails or dynamite. Though if the player can shoot the projectile while it's in the Haunted's hands it will explode, killing them -- however it may still do damage to the player if they're within proximity. Some Haunted will be shown wearing a mask, which while not indestructible does make headshots less viable of a strategy. It also makes them immune to the effects of flash bolts.</p><p style="">Certain Haunted throughout the game will have access to firearms. Early on they are restricted to bolt-action sniper rifles, though later in the game they can be encountered using revolvers, assault rifles, or even an Agony Crossbow complete with explosive bolts. The ones equipped with assault rifles are also typically found wearing not only a mask but also body armor, making them much more resistant to damage than most.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2695772-7b9605f1d194c466f7e438fae5e8e9fb1afd838f.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2695772" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2695772-7b9605f1d194c466f7e438fae5e8e9fb1afd838f.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2695772"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2695772-7b9605f1d194c466f7e438fae5e8e9fb1afd838f.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2695772-7b9605f1d194c466f7e438fae5e8e9fb1afd838f.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">The player will often encounter Haunted that are, as the game declares them, ''fatter'', which can withstand significantly more damage than the regular variety. Another special type of Haunted is one that is completely invisible. The way to pick their location is by noting any obstacles they inadvertently push out of their way, or puddles that will mark their footsteps; they'll also reveal themselves just before they attack. This type of Haunted is only encountered in Chapter 5.</p><p style="">Later in the game during Chapters 12-14, there'll be Haunted firemen still with their extinguisher on their back. Shooting it will make it explode, killing the fireman Haunted and potentially damaging any nearby Haunted as well.</p><h3>Mr. Unknown</h3><p style="">The most dangerous type of Haunted, made distinctive by wearing a hood and robe akin to main antagonist Ruvik. Once alerted to the player they will unleash a vicious scream and then vomit a stream of red blood. The stream will then manifest into a puddle of blood, where the claws of Laura will begin lunging out. The puddle will chase the player for a set time until eventually evaporating, and the only way to end it prematurely is by killing the Haunted that unleashed it. If it catches the player, it is a one-hit kill. Not only are their offensive properties as such extremely dangerous, but they also cannot be stealth killed. Headshots won't work either, as where their head should be is but a black void.</p><h3>AlterEgo</h3><p style="">An enemy similar to the Haunted, only they cannot use any weapons and are much more resistant to damage. Their primary source of attack is try and bite at the player, requiring them to wiggle the stick to throw it off. They will otherwise simply punch the player, though will also sometimes bring forth a tentacle that sprouts out of their torso, giving them an increased range of attack. AlterEgos will sometimes be encountered already on the floor and will slowly crawl towards the player. While the instinct is to throw a match unto them, AlterEgos will typically leap up at the player and begin biting them before they can get close enough to throw the match.</p><p style="">While headshots are the most suitable strategy, they notably have two heads, requiring players to destroy both to kill it thataway.</p><h3>Sadist</h3><p style="">A tall, bulbous chainsaw-wielding maniac, Sadists are encountered sparingly and function as sub-bosses. They are rather fast and are able to keep up with Sebastian even as he's sprinting; any attack from a Sadist will also kill the player instantly. They are rather strong as one may expect and can withstand much more damage than any Haunted.</p><p style="">One Sadist in Chapter 15 is encountered while wielding a rocket launcher as opposed to a chainsaw, though he will eventually revert to a chainsaw once he's ran out of ammo for his rocket launcher.</p><h3>Trauma</h3><p style="">Another sub-boss enemy that is fought rather infrequently throughout the game. Like the Sadist it can withstand a great deal of damage, though it does at least have weak spot on its back. Traumas have two forms; their first, default form has their arms locked in shackles wrapped with chains -- which they can use as a long-ranged attack. After so much damage, however, they will break free from their shackles and become more aggressive, but will also lose their ability to sling a chain towards the player.</p><h2>Boss Battles</h2><h3>Laura Part I</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2710372-the_evil_within-re-bone_laura-07.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2710372" data-ratio="1.3333333333333" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:133.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2710372-the_evil_within-re-bone_laura-07.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2710372"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2710372-the_evil_within-re-bone_laura-07.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2710372-the_evil_within-re-bone_laura-07.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">The first boss battle of the game set at the end of Chapter 5. Players will encounter Laura a little earlier before they enter the battle arena, however their only option will be to run away.</p><p style="">When reaching the boss arena, Laura must now be 'killed' in order to move on. Fortunately the battle is conveniently set within a furnace and Laura happens to have an innate weakness to fire. Simply shooting her will still deal damage, however she has a knack for rapidly teleporting towards the player avoiding the bullets in the process. As such, utilising the number of fire-related tools nearby is vital.</p><p style="">The primary source of fire is the furnace itself, which the player can potentially lure Laura into and then pull the nearby lever, opening the grate and dropping her into the fire below. This can be performed two times, however once each lever has been used is it then made to be inoperable. There are a number of red barrels that will ignite and explode when shot which will deal damage to Laura, however they are removed for the Nightmare and Akumu difficulty settings. There are also a few torches located that players can wield and attack Laura with as well. As Laura will often burst out of one of the many corpses located throughout the area, it's possible the player can catch her on fire by throwing a match on the corpse as she's materialising.</p><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2692486-1794793_945314802163269_7802439564976285603_n.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2692486" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2692486-1794793_945314802163269_7802439564976285603_n.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2692486"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2692486-1794793_945314802163269_7802439564976285603_n.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2692486-1794793_945314802163269_7802439564976285603_n.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Laura's offensive capabilities are primarily restricted to a one-hit kill that has a surprising range, though she will sometimes opt to do a regular slash with one of her claws.

The somewhat more reserved Zehn is fought first after he is unleashed by a Haunted. Wielding a large makeshift club, he will swing it about and can potentially cause great damage if his attacks hit.</p><p style="">The other twin, Neun, is much more aggressive than his sibling and his noted by the tight leather mask he wears around his face, covering his eyes. He is thusly blind and relies on sound to track Sebastian, though he is also more prone to charging throughout the area. Unlike his brother, however, Zeun has no melee weapon in hand.</p><p style="">It's possible that Zehn can be killed first before facing Neun, however the tight corridors from where he is first encountered may make this tricky. Players can attempt to run away from Zehn, at least until arriving at a more open environment to do battle, but that will also force the player to fight against both twins simultaneously.</p><h3>Sentinel</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2710373-the_sentinel.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2710373" data-ratio="0.56264775413712" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2710373-the_sentinel.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2710373"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2710373-the_sentinel.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2710373-the_sentinel.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">A large, ravenous canine of sorts. The Sentinel boss fight is a simple one, as the player is forced into a circular battle ground and must unload whatever weaponry they have into the beast. However Sentinel is rather fast, which can make hitting it and also avoiding its rush attacks difficult. It will routinely hide within the bushes in the area, before then charging out untoward the player.</p><p style="">Once it has taken enough punishment the player is able to escape, however Joseph Oda then notes that the dog knocked off his glasses. The player must now head back into the arena and collect the glasses, just as Sentinel regains its strength. From this point on the player can choose to either collect the glasses and head back to Joseph, or attempt to kill Sentinel once and for all. To collect the requisite green gel reward from the boss fight Sentinel must be killed; simply beating it during the first bout will yield no rewards.</p><h3>The Keeper Part I</h3><p style="">A mysterious creature that is dressed like a butcher while also wearing a safe on its head. The first time the player encounters The Keeper they are to try and simultaneously turn the valves to halt the stream of poison gas, while also trying to stave off The Keeper.</p><p style="">While killing The Keeper isn't especially difficult, it is able to materialise from any one of the safe heads littered throughout the area.</p><h2>Unlockables</h2><h3>Difficulty Settings</h3><p style="">Both Nightmare and Akumu modes will be unlocked after completing the game on either of the two previous difficulty settings.</p><h3>Weapons</h3><h4>Machine Gun</h4><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2700439-10806449_962429020451847_1536130482297131056_n.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2700439" data-ratio="0.52180685358255" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:52.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2700439-10806449_962429020451847_1536130482297131056_n.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2700439"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2700439-10806449_962429020451847_1536130482297131056_n.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2700439-10806449_962429020451847_1536130482297131056_n.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">An unlockable weapon that is gifted to the player after completing the game.

Vents and crawl spaces can be found throughout the environment, which will help the player to circumvent enemies and stay hidden.</p><p style="">Kidman's primary piece of equipment is her flashlight, which she must use to help explore the area as the environments are typically rather dark. She can also use the flashlight to uncover secret rooms, by focussing the flashlight on any of the Mobius symbols. During one instance where she encounters invisible Haunted, she can use the flashlight to temporarily reveal them to the player's view. Players will also encounter bottles, which can be used much like in the main game as a means to create a distraction to lure away enemies.</p><p style="">While most forms of combat have been completely removed, Kidman does still have access to a melee attack. However much like Sebastian's it is only suitable for defence as the damage it deals is minimal; that, and a single kick will use up around half her stamina. There is at least one segment where Kidman is trapped and must shoot all of the encroaching enemies; she will have infinite ammo for her pistol during this time, however this is the only occasion during the DLC where she can actively use it.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2735078-11059657_1037804489580966_2348171501259831939_n.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2735078" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2735078-11059657_1037804489580966_2348171501259831939_n.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2735078"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2735078-11059657_1037804489580966_2348171501259831939_n.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2735078-11059657_1037804489580966_2348171501259831939_n.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">There are a number of Keeper safe heads, each of which houses a scrap of paper. However each safe first requires the player to input a code of sorts; the answer is usually nearby, hidden in plain sight. All of the safes are optional and merely exist as a collectable. There are also other collectables hidden in the environment that will unlock 3D character models and songs from the soundtrack to listen to from the DLC's main menu.</p><h2>Development</h2><p style="">The Evil Within was originally announced under the codename Project Zwei, and was noticeably different than how The Evil Within actually ended up. It was initially conceptualized as a ''vampire hunting action game starring a man and a woman attached by a chain''. Because of the two-character setup, cooperative gameplay was to be a significant role in the game; when played solo, players would then have to control the two characters simultaneously -- similar to <a href="/brothers-a-tale-of-two-sons/3030-39854/" data-ref-id="3030-39854">Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons</a>. This idea was eventually scrapped, after Mikami had received feedback suggesting that vampires weren't very popular, and that his colleagues wished to design a more traditional horror game instead. Other such stages of their first game included it having a sci-fi aesthetic, to also being open-world.</p><p style="">The Evil Within was eventually revealed with its now official title via an IGN-exclusive live-action teaser trailer, with further exclusive coverage on IGN the following week.</p><p style="">As the self-proclaimed 'father of survival horror', Mikami took on this endeavor specifically because he believes there is a noticeable lack of survival horror games in the market. What often passes for survival horror is considered too action-focused by Mikami, and he hopes to bring back the balance of experiencing the fear of a horror game with the thrill of an action game to the sub-genre.</p><p style="">Mikami has stated that the Winchester Mystery House played a part in inspiring the look and design of some of the environments in the game. Martin Scorsese's film interpretation of <em>The Shutter Island</em> story has also been cited as an inspiration during development, as was Christopher Nolan's <em>Inception</em> film. The visual design of the Keeper creature was partly inspired by <a href="/clive-barker/3040-37997/" data-ref-id="3040-37997">Clive Barker</a>'s <em>Hellraiser </em>film<em>.</em></p><p style="">On May 27th, The Evil Within's release was delayed from August 26th to October 21st for NA, the 23rd for Oceania, and 24th for Europe. On July 18th, however, the date was then pushed <em>forward </em>a week for a worldwide October 14th release.</p><p style="">Amongst brainstorming for DLC, one such idea involved the player taking the role Joseph Oda as a ninja (whose family is descended from ninjas), to which the gameplay was said to resemble <a href="/dishonored/3030-35850/" data-ref-id="3030-35850">Dishonored</a>. So much so that the title for the DLC was jokingly referred to as ''Dis'Oda'd''.</p><h3><a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/videos/here-s-the-live-action-teaser-for-shinji-mikami-s-/2300-7281/" data-ref-id="2300-7281">Teaser Trailer</a></h3><figure data-ref-id="1300-2478779" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2478779-the_evil_within_reborn_spider_lady.0_cinema_960.0.jpg" data-size="small" data-align="right" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2478779-the_evil_within_reborn_spider_lady.0_cinema_960.0.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2478779"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2478779-the_evil_within_reborn_spider_lady.0_cinema_960.0.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2478779-the_evil_within_reborn_spider_lady.0_cinema_960.0.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Filming the trailer</figcaption></figure><p style="">The trailer that officially introduced the game was produced by the company Prologue Pictures and was directed by <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/kyle-cooper/3040-64921/" data-ref-id="3040-64921">Kyle Cooper</a>. It was made using only practical effects (such as prosthetics and makeup) rather than CGI. To add to the bloodied effect of some of the characters shown in the trailer, such as the multi-armed 'Reborn' called Laura, the performers were to sit in a bath filled with fake blood for hours on end. The trailer took 3 days to complete.</p><p style="">Executive-producer Alex Dervin said that some actors suffered discomfort during filming, but this served to instil ''some of the anger'' necessary for the roles.</p><h3>The Onion Barbed Wire Trailer</h3><p style="">Bethesda teamed up with the satirist news website The Onion to produce a trailer, parodying the often brought up criticisms about how certain cultures/minorities ect. are portrayed within games. It sets itself up as a news headline, vilifying Bethesda for their portrayal of barbed wire and how it is often shown as a tool for murder and/or by murderers, subliminally referring to <a href="/boxman/3005-28555/" data-ref-id="3005-28555">Boxman</a>.</p><h3>Japanese Title</h3><p style="">The game's Japanese release is entitled "PsychoBreak," a name chosen because it is much easier for native Japanese speakers to pronounce. This mirrors Resident Evil's use of the title "Biohazard" in Japan. Much like most games, The Evil Within went through numerous other names before settling on its final moniker; ''Mobius'' was one such name.</p><h3>Censorship in Japan</h3><p style="">In order to get past scoring a rating of CERO Z for a more widespread CERO D, The Evil Within's gore in its Japanese release will be <a href="/censored-version/3015-2170/" data-ref-id="3015-2170">censored</a>. However by preordering the game, Japanese players will then have access to a free download to unlock the game's gore.</p><p style="">Come the game's release, however, it was uncovered that even with the gore turned on it's still censored to a certain degree when compared to the game's western releases.</p><h2>Alternate Boxart Cover</h2><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2670662-insidewrap-03-1024-11.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2670662" data-ratio="1.4503171247357" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:145.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2670662-insidewrap-03-1024-11.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2670662"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2670662-insidewrap-03-1024-11.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2670662-insidewrap-03-1024-11.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">On July 30th, the official Bethesda blog held a poll to decide which of the three images they have designed will function as the game's alternate cover for launch copies.

The game was developed by <a href="/mark-hadley/3040-103406/" data-ref-id="3040-103406">Mark Hadley</a> in conjunction with <a href="/blue-isle-studios/3010-8446/" data-ref-id="3010-8446">Blue Isle Studios</a> with the goal of creating a scarier, more detailed, more involved <a href="/slender-man/3005-23838/" data-ref-id="3005-23838">Slender Man</a> experience. The game was written by the creators of <i>Marble Hornets</i>, the first series of Slender Man-related videos on YouTube: <a href="/troy-wagner/3040-103323/" data-ref-id="3040-103323">Troy Wagner</a>, <a href="/joseph-delage-iii/3040-103322/" data-ref-id="3040-103322">Joseph DeLage III</a>, and <a href="/tim-sutton/3040-102523/" data-ref-id="3040-102523">Tim Sutton</a>. Slender Man creator <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/eric-knudsen/3040-107305/" data-ref-id="3040-107305">Eric "Victor Surge" Knudsen</a> served as an executive producer, making this game at the time of its release, the only officially licensed Slender Man game (as stated in press materials). Slender: The Arrival was released on March 26, 2013.</p><p style="">The beta was included for all that pre-ordered. The beta was a remake of the original Slender: The Eight Pages but with enhanced graphics, a camera view with zoom, and a new beach-side location.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">Similar in nature to Slender: The Eight Pages, the primary gameplay revolves around the player exploring environments and collecting items while trying to avoid Slender Man. The closer the player comes to completing a given stage's particular objective, the more likely Slender Man will make his appearance. Slender Man cannot be fought, only avoided, and the player loses if Slender Man has the player in his sights for too long.</p><h2 style="margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;">Console Release</h2><p style="">Blue Isle has included two new "flashback" levels.

It was released as one of the first <a href="/playstation-mobile/3015-6740/" data-ref-id="3015-6740">PlayStation Mobile</a> games in October 2012, later coming to PC and <a href="/xbox-live-indie-games/3015-2533/" data-ref-id="3015-2533">Xbox Live Indie Games</a> in June 2013.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">The game takes place under the sea where kitties must be protected from the alien invaders. Once one wave of aliens have been defeated the next wave spawns until there are no more enemies to defeat. To do so the player has a single bullet mode which has infinite ammo. As an option, the player has burst mode, these fire long range bunches of bullets. This ammo, however is limited but can be upgraded by completing levels. Early levels typically feature one or two kitty civilians and a small grouping of enemies. As the levels progress there are an increased number and variety of enemies to contend with. For scoring, each saved kitty is worth 2000 points. Each subsequent enemy killed in quick succession will increase the point multiplier by one. This multiplier degrades over time and will eventually reset to zero.</p><h3>Infinite Mode</h3><p style="">A second gameplay mode is infinite mode. As the name implies, there are an infinite number of waves that increase rapidly in difficulty. The player is scored on their progress as well as efficiency.</p><p style=""> </p><h2>PC System Requirements</h2><h3><strong>Minimum:</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows XP / Vista / 7 / 8</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 1.2Ghz Processor</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 1 GB RAM</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> DirectX 9.0c-compatible graphics card with 128 MB VRAM</li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 9.0c</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong> 140 MB available space</li><li><strong>Sound Card:</strong> DirectX 9.0c</li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> Controls: Joypads or Keyboard.

While boasting updated graphics, it maintains a similar art style to that of the original. With the game removing the individual screens which was the format of the original game, some puzzles have changed and this has meant that some levels and puzzles have been reworked to fit in better with the new structure. The game also introduces new mechanics which were previously not available during Abe's Oddysee, although used in it's sequels, including a <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/quicksaving/3015-2127/" data-ref-id="3015-2127">quick save</a> feature and improved gamespeak. Improved gamespeak allows the player to talk to more than one Mudokon at once, which also changes some of the puzzles, making them far easier than before. Because of this, some puzzles have been slightly reworked as to balance this feature, as in Abe's Oddysee, Abe could only have the attention of one Mudokon at a time.</p><p style="">The <a href="/playstation-4/3045-146/" data-ref-id="3045-146">PlayStation 4</a> version of the game was originally released on July 22, 2014. The <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC</a>, <a href="/mac/3045-17/" data-ref-id="3045-17">Mac</a>, and <a href="/linux/3045-152/" data-ref-id="3045-152">Linux</a> versions of the game are set to be released on February 25, 2015. The <a href="/playstation-3/3045-35/" data-ref-id="3045-35">PlayStation 3</a> and <a href="/xbox-one/3045-145/" data-ref-id="3045-145">Xbox One</a> versions of the game are slated for release sometime in March of 2015. The Wii U version of the game was initially developed internally and then later handed off to port house Olde Sküül. It's set for a Fall 2015 release.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style="">The game takes place in the continent of Mudos, in the land of <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/oddworld/3035-288/" data-ref-id="3035-288">Oddworld</a>. Home to <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/mudokons/3015-1122/" data-ref-id="3015-1122">Mudokons</a>, <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/glukkon/3015-1567/" data-ref-id="3015-1567">Glukkons</a> and various wildlife such as <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/scrab/3015-1322/" data-ref-id="3015-1322">Scrabs</a>, <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/paramite/3015-1573/" data-ref-id="3015-1573">Paramites</a> and the now extinct Meeches, in it lies the biggest meat processing plant in Oddworld: <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/rupturefarms/3035-802/" data-ref-id="3035-802">Rupturefarms</a>. Administrated by the high ranking Glukkon of the Magog Cartel, known as <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/molluck-the-glukkon/3005-3805/" data-ref-id="3005-3805">Molluck</a>, he was faced with a huge dilemma, with profits beginning to fall and the future of Rupturefarms was looking grim. The creatures of Oddworld were running scarce, thanks to the extinction of Meeches and the high in-take of Scrabs and Paramites. Molluck had to come up with a new and daring plan, to help save the future of Rupturefarms. A new kind of meat that would boost sales and create a profit once again. A meat made from their very own 'employees', the Mudokons called Mudokon Pops.</p><p style="">We follow the story of <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/abe/3005-729/" data-ref-id="3005-729">Abe</a>, a slave of Rupturefarms who is working late one night. Spotting a light through a gap, he sneaks over and listens into board meeting with the Glukkons and overhears Molluck's bold new plan. With a screen showcasing the falling profits, Molluck is confident and reveals their new product to the other Glukkons. Upon the discovery of what New 'N' Tasty really is, Abe flees the scene and is spotted by a camera, which causes <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/slig/3015-644/" data-ref-id="3015-644">Sligs</a> to take chase. Abe must escape and save as many of his other 299 fellow employees in the process, whilst utilizing his power to possess Sligs and guide other Mudokons to safety.</p><p style="">After escaping RuptureFarms and unaware that he has a destiny, Abe spots a moon in the sky with the paw of his people. Being enchanted by the moon, Abe slips off of a cliff and hits his head. Whilst knocked out, he is confronted by the mysterious tribesman wearing a large mask, known as <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/big-face/3005-14569/" data-ref-id="3005-14569">Big Face</a>. Big Face shows Abe a vision and explains that he must save the remaining workers at RuptureFarms in order to restore the lost land. To do so, he must complete a number of trials in the dark forests of Paramonia and the scorching hot deserts of Scrabania. Upon completed the trials, Big Face bestows a scar on each of Abe's hands, resembling a Paramite and a Scrab. Combined, they allow one to become the mighty and powerful demi-God, known as <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/shrykull/3005-5347/" data-ref-id="3005-5347">Shrykull</a>. Once in possession of this power, Abe can return to RuptureFarms and rescue his remaining friends until finally shutting the factory down for good!</p><p style="">After shutting down all the power, Abe finds himself caught in the board room, where he is knocked out and captured. Taken away by Sligs, he is tied up above a meat grinder, preventing him from chanting and bestowing the power of Shrykull or possessing any Sligs. Meanwhile, Big Face and the freed Mukokons discuss Abe's actions and whether or not he should be saved. It is at this point the game splits into two different endings. Abe's life, in the hands of the Mudokons is determined by how many are saved during the game. Whether or not he lives, is down to them...</p><p style="">Should Abe save enough Mudokons for them to even consider saving him, they combine their power, causing electricity to form from the sky, striking Molluck and his loyal Slig, either killing them or incapacitating them. With both of them down, Big Face appears and teleports Abe to a ceremony, celebrating his success, where all 99 Mudokons are cheering his name.</p><p style="">If Abe does not save enough of the Mudokons, he is ultimately left behind by the few who made it back safely. Disgusted with his behaviour, they refuse to help Big Face and leave Abe for dead. Molluck then gives the order for his execution and a Slig pulls a lever, releasing Abe into the meat grinder, killing him.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>39928</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/1/14876/2644182-new_n_tasty_official_cover_art.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14876/2644182-new_n_tasty_official_cover_art.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/1/14876/2644182-new_n_tasty_official_cover_art.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14876/2644182-new_n_tasty_official_cover_art.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/14876/2644182-new_n_tasty_official_cover_art.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/14876/2644182-new_n_tasty_official_cover_art.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/1/14876/2644182-new_n_tasty_official_cover_art.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee New 'n' Tasty!]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-1/]]></api_detail_url><id>1</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: T]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-36/]]></api_detail_url><id>36</id><name><![CDATA[PEGI: 12+]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-38/]]></api_detail_url><id>38</id><name><![CDATA[OFLC: PG]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2014-07-22 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-17/]]></api_detail_url><id>17</id><name><![CDATA[Mac]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/mac/3045-17/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[MAC]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-88/]]></api_detail_url><id>88</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation Network (PS3)]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-network-ps3/3045-88/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3N]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-139/]]></api_detail_url><id>139</id><name><![CDATA[Wii U]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/wii-u/3045-139/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[WIIU]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-143/]]></api_detail_url><id>143</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation Network (Vita)]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-network-vita/3045-143/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PSNV]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-145/]]></api_detail_url><id>145</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox One]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-one/3045-145/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[XONE]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/]]></api_detail_url><id>146</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 4]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS4]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-152/]]></api_detail_url><id>152</id><name><![CDATA[Linux]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/linux/3045-152/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[LIN]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/oddworld-abes-oddysee-new-n-tasty/3030-39928/]]></site_detail_url></game></results><version>1.0</version></response>
