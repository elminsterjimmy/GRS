limbs!]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Fantavision is a PS2 game where the object of the game is to make fireworks. During gameplay various colors scroll alongside the screen. Your objective is to connect three colors together and detonate them. Chains however can be longer than three colors, and there are various power-ups that you can chain together to make multicolored combos. There is a meter on the screen, and if it runs out, (by missing too many colors) it's game over. Unlike most puzzlers, Fantavision is actually a level based game. There is no endless mode at all to speak of. At the end of each level, players can save their firework display and replay it from a variety of different camera angles and through various filters. Also just to be weird there are 1960's styled retro-future, live action vignettes that appeear between levels,</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>361</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/2117035-box_fvision.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/2117035-box_fvision.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/2117035-box_fvision.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/2117035-box_fvision.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/2117035-box_fvision.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2117035-box_fvision.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/2117035-box_fvision.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[FantaVision]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-6/]]></api_detail_url><id>6</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: E]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-7/]]></api_detail_url><id>7</id><name><![CDATA[PEGI: 3+]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2000-03-04 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-19/]]></api_detail_url><id>19</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 2]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-2/3045-19/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS2]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/]]></api_detail_url><id>146</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 4]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS4]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/fantavision/3030-361/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[Solomon no Kagi

Dana uses his magic wand to strategically create or destroy stone blocks, in search of each level's key and exit door. Various monsters block Dana's progress, which he can avoid, trap with blocks, or fight with fire spells.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">The level design becomes increasingly devious as it progresses and often makes it possible for the player to trap themselves, making it impossible to finish the level. Other levels require precise timing to reach the key and the level's door, while enemies become more frequent and aggressive. Players start with three lives, but can continue by holding UP and pressing A + B from the "Game Deviation Value" screen. Once players move beyond level 40, continues return them there. Finishing the game means completing levels 40 through 50 with only 3 lives, a very challenging feat.</p><h2>Abilities</h2><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5168/274018-large2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-274018" data-size="large" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5168/274018-large2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-274018"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/5168/274018-large2.jpg"></a><figcaption>A typical Solomon's Key level.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Players can do three things to help Dana move through each level, search for the key, and avoid danger.</p><ul><li>Create and destroy orange blocks in adjacent spaces, including blocks diagonally above or below.</li><li>Break overhead blocks by jumping into them twice with his head.</li><li>Shoot fireballs at enemies after retrieving red potions that are scattered throughout the levels.</li></ul><p style="">While movement seems simple at first, the game makes use of its limited mechanics to create ever more difficult puzzles that call for precise jumping and block creation. Players who can place blocks in mid-jump (creating a block below Dana while in mid-air) will find the game's hardest puzzles more navigable.</p><h2>Hidden Items and Game Endings</h2><p style="">Game levels organize around the Zodiac's 12 houses, with 4 rooms per sign. Level 1 to 4 is Aries, 5 to 8 is Taurus, and so on, through Pisces at 45-48. When players pick up the constellation tile in the last room of each group (level 4, 8, 12, etc.), they enter hidden levels that contain spells and special items. While Solomon's Key ends after level 48 (or the Fairy room, details below), players can earn better endings by collecting Seals of Solomon and these special items.</p><ul><li>Worst ending: failed to collect Seals of Solomon.</li><li>Better ending: collect five Seals (rooms 9, 13, 17, 21, 29), Page of Time (hidden room after 20), and Page of Space (hidden room after 44)</li><li>Best ending: collect seven Seals (rooms 9, 13, 17, 21, 29, 46, 47), Page of Time, Page of Space, and save Fairy Princess (hidden room after 48)</li></ul>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>928</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/9/93770/2362245-nes_solomonskey.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93770/2362245-nes_solomonskey.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/9/93770/2362245-nes_solomonskey.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/9/93770/2362245-nes_solomonskey.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/9/93770/2362245-nes_solomonskey.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2362245-nes_solomonskey.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/9/93770/2362245-nes_solomonskey.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Solomon's

It is capable of firing rockets.</li></ul><h2>Missions</h2><h3>Mission 1</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6844/887445-metal_slug_3_other_boss.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-887445" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6844/887445-metal_slug_3_other_boss.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-887445"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6844/887445-metal_slug_3_other_boss.jpg"></a><figcaption>Marco, relaxing at home.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The first mission puts you on an island, where crabs reign supreme. Shoot through them, as well as soldiers and giant bugs to get to the boss: a <a href="/giant-enemy-crab/3015-747" data-ref-id="3015-747">giant crab</a>.</p><h3>Mission 2</h3><p style="">You arrive in a dark forest. What's there? Zombies, of course. Getting hit with the zombies' projectile bile turns you into a zombie, leaving you invincible against normal bullets, but another zombie hit means death. The boss of this place is a group of floating aliens and their glowy ship thing, once they're taken out.</p><h3>Mission 3</h3><p style="">While the first half of this mission is underwater, the other half- you know- isn't. Blow up submarines and SCUBA divers throughout the first half, and soldiers throughout the second. The boss here is a big ol' robot with laser eyes and a chest full of missiles.</p><h3>Mission 4</h3><p style="">Immediately after arriving in this desert, you are given a camel to ride. Appreciate him. Fight through waves of soldiers, helicopters and metal slugs for a while, then man-eating plants or mummies- depending on the path you choose. The boss here is... Well, I'm not sure. A floating alien-robot head? He has a beam that will turn you into gold, so try to avoid that.</p><h3>Final Mission</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/920571-xdk006_image24.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-920571" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/920571-xdk006_image24.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-920571"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/920571-xdk006_image24.jpg"></a></figure><p style="">The first part of this mission is played as a horizontal shooter in the style of <a href="/gradius/3030-15508" data-ref-id="3030-15508"><i>Gradius</i></a>, which culminates in a boss fight against <a href="/allen-oneil/3005-15040" data-ref-id="3005-15040">Allen O'Neil</a>. After defeating an alien impersonating <a href="/general-morden/3005-279" data-ref-id="3005-279">General Morden</a> in a fight reminiscent of the original <a href="/metal-slug/3030-847" data-ref-id="3030-847"><i>Metal Slug</i></a>'s final boss fight, your character is captured and beamed aboard a ship. You assume control of another character for a vertical shooter sequence chasing them. Inside the alien ship, you will rescue the real Morden, who is found in a torture device, stripped to his underwear. After teaming up with O'Neil against alien clones of your previous character, you save your partner, destroy the ship and escape out the airlock, fighting the final boss while falling back to earth.</p><h2>Extra Modes</h2><p style="">On the console versions, there are two more modes unlocked after beating the game.</p><h3>Fat Island</h3><ul><li>An eating competition between two players. Whoever gets the fattest wins, while not eating eventually turns the character into a <a href="/mummy/3015-1736" data-ref-id="3015-1736">mummy</a>.</li></ul><h3>Storming the UFO Mothership</h3><ul><li>Play as one of General Morden's soldiers and kill some aliens.</li></ul>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>1063</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/9/93770/2296047-cover_large.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93770/2296047-cover_large.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/9/93770/2296047-cover_large.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/9/93770/2296047-cover_large.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/9/93770/2296047-cover_large.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2296047-cover_large.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/9/93770/2296047-cover_large.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Metal

Nichibutsu) and is one of their earliest games. While a fairly straightforward example of the genre at the time, it featured a few interesting design choices. The chief of which was the ability for the player's ship to enhance its firepower by collecting weapon pods: Doing this would also change the appearance of the ship, making it larger and appear more elaborate. Should the player collect the fifth and final weapon pod, the ship temporarily transforms into a fiery <a href="/phoenix/3015-730" data-ref-id="3015-730">phoenix</a> that is utterly invulnerable for a brief spell. Should the player get hit at any other time, they either lose the last upgrade they found or are destroyed entirely if their ship is in its least powered-up state.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>1272</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/0/2453/1498500-terracusa_front.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2453/1498500-terracusa_front.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/0/2453/1498500-terracusa_front.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2453/1498500-terracusa_front.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/2453/1498500-terracusa_front.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2453/1498500-terracusa_front.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/0/2453/1498500-terracusa_front.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Terra Cresta]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating/><original_release_date>1986-09-27 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-14/]]></api_detail_url><id>14</id><name><![CDATA[Commodore 64]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/commodore-64/3045-14/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[C64]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-16/]]></api_detail_url><id>16</id><name><![CDATA[ZX Spectrum]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/zx-spectrum/3045-16/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[SPEC]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-21/]]></api_detail_url><id>21</id><name><![CDATA[Nintendo Entertainment System]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-21/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[NES]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-84/]]></api_detail_url><id>84</id><name><![CDATA[Arcade]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/arcade/3045-84/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[ARC]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-95/]]></api_detail_url><id>95</id><name><![CDATA[Sharp X68000]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/sharp-x68000/3045-95/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X68K]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/]]></api_detail_url><id>146</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 4]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS4]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/terra-cresta/3030-1272/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-3329/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-04-01 01:45:23</date_added><date_last_updated>2015-11-18 13:31:06</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[Star Force is a vertical scrolling shoot 'em up game for the Nintendo Entertainment System]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Star Force first entered the scene on the arcades.

Struggling against a painful case of amnesia, Mercer escapes the morgue in search of his sister, <a href="../../dana-mercer/94-9178/" rel="nofollow">Dana</a>. Working with his sister and other allies, Alex seeks to uncover his powers' origins as well as stop a mysterious viral outbreak that has also appeared on the island.</p><p style="">Unfortunately, Mercer is hindered by the United States military as well as the merciless <a href="../../blackwatch/92-2367/" rel="nofollow">Blackwatch</a>. These black ops soldiers will stop at nothing to contain the virus and capture Mercer, even if it means destroying everyone and everything in their path. With martial law declared and an iron blockade isolating Manhattan, Alex has no choice but to confront both the <a href="../../the-infected/92-2368/" rel="nofollow">viral monsters</a> and the military forces at every turn, all the while uncovering the terrible secrets concerning the nature of the virus and the nature of his powers.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2891/1062832-prototype_273.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1062832" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2891/1062832-prototype_273.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1062832"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2891/1062832-prototype_273.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2891/1062832-prototype_273.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Tanks?

Locomotion is also similar, with both games' protagonists capable of running along the facades of skyscrapers and leaping hundreds of feet into the air. Augmenting Alex Mercer's superior running and jumping skills is his ability to " <a href="../../auto-parkour/92-3314/" rel="nofollow">auto parkour</a>". As long as he is running, obstacles in Alex Mercer's path are automatically leaped and flipped over, providing a single, fluid direction of movement regardless of the path taken.</p><p style="">Prototype also introduces new stealth mechanics where players may literally consume other humans and take their form, using the disguise for both evasion and infiltration. The act of consuming another being also replenishes Mercer's biomass, effectively turning any person into a <a href="../../health-pack/93-255/" rel="nofollow">health boost</a>. In certain points in the game, consuming another being does more than just replenish health. Alex Mercer may also absorb the memories, skills, and even the personality of his victim, allowing Mercer to uncover story elements, gain new skills, and improve existing ones.</p><h2>Powers</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2891/1062607-prototype_164.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1062607" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2891/1062607-prototype_164.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1062607"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2891/1062607-prototype_164.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2891/1062607-prototype_164.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Combine the blade and armor powers.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Alex Mercer possesses a wide variety of abilities, many of which require manual activation by the player. These active powers are separated into categories. At any one time, Alex may simultaneously equip one offensive, defensive, and visual power. His disguise power, however, may only be simultaneously used with visual powers. Intelligent use of these abilities allows the player to conquer any obstacle the game presents.</p><h3>Miscellaneous Powers</h3><ul><li><b>Consume</b> - Alex can absorb the biomass of the humans he kills into his body, replenishing his health. Larger, inhuman enemies may also be partially consumed once weakened. Alex can also absorb the memories of some of the people he consumes; consuming specific targets may improve combat skills or provide insight into various story elements, also known as the "Web of Intrigue".</li><li><b>Regeneration</b> - If Alex is injured and no longer receiving damage, his body will automatically repair itself and slowly regain health.</li><li><b>Strength</b> - With superhuman strength, Alex can punch through armoured tanks and hurl the resulting husks at helicopters.</li><li><b>Speed</b> - Alex can sprint indefinitely through oncoming traffic and straight up the sides of buildings.</li><li><b>Glide</b> - When running isn't the best option, Alex produces invisible filaments extending from his arms and legs, allowing him to glide short distances.</li><li><b>Devastator Abilities</b> - By possessing sufficient biomass, Alex may turn his body into a weapon of even greater destruction, hurling his form as ground spikes, airborne tendrils, or a single pillar of death.</li></ul><h3>Offensive Powers</h3><ul><li><b>Claws</b> - Each of Alex's fingers becomes a vicious claw. Although significantly more powerful than his fists, these weapons are still relatively weak in melee. However, they grant Alex the ability to send his claws underground, erupting violently underneath an opponent.</li><li><b>Hammerfists</b> - Alex shifts a great deal of biomass into his hands, transforming them into enormous bludgeons with which he can smash through the protection of armored targets or even turn himself into a human projectile.</li><li><b>Whipfist</b> - Alex's right arms transforms into an elastic, whip-like tendril with a terminal hook. The Whipfist is best used on multiple or distant opponents as well as latching onto distant obstacles and pulling them closer. Especially useful is its ability to latch onto helicopters to let Alex get close enough to steal them.</li><li><b>Musclemass</b> - Alex focuses his biomass into both his arms, drastically increasing his strength. While he no longer has access to special moves associated with other offensive powers, Alex's traditional combos and thrown objects now deal increased damage.</li><li><b>Blade</b> - One of the signature abilities. Alex's right arm transforms into a single elongated blade, deadly against both armoured and unarmoured opponents. Despite its shape, Alex is still able to grab and pick up people with it... somehow.</li></ul><h3>Defensive Powers</h3><ul><li><b>Shield</b> - Alex's left arm grows into a shield which extends to cover his front while he runs or locks onto a target, protecting him from damage. However, it can shatter if given enough punishment. It regenerates over time. It also disables his parkour abilities, in favour of holding the shield in front of him and smashing straight through obstacles.</li><li><b>Armour Form</b> - Alex's entire body becomes encased in an incredibly durable armour skin, reducing all received damage. Such increased mass, however, decreases Alex's mobility. He can no longer parkour or glide and his jumping ability is greatly diminished.</li></ul><h3>Sensory Powers</h3><ul><li><b>Thermal Vision</b> - Alex's visual senses attune to the infrared band, allowing him to more easily spot heat signatures through fog and smoke. Drawbacks include reduced visual range and a decrease in auditory feedback.</li><li><b>Infected Vision</b> - By connecting his mind to the viral hive mind that guides the infected, Alex sees the world as his enemy sees. Enemies become more brightly illuminated, and line of sight is no longer reduced. Auditory senses, however, are decreased to only a low rumbling at all times.</li></ul><h3>Disguise Abilities</h3><ul><li><b>Disguise</b> - Alex <a href="../../shape-shifting/92-570/" rel="nofollow">shapeshifts</a> into the form of the last healthy human he consumed (he cannot take the form of the Infected). Doing so has many applications, chiefly evading pursuers and using the shape of military personnel to infiltrate fortified military installations. If no alarm has been raised, Alex may even silently hijack vehicles without breaking cover.</li><li><b>Stealth Consume</b> - If no military personnel are watching, Alex may consume and take the form of an individual in one fluid motion without raising an alarm.</li><li><b>Patsy</b> - Only available while in military disguise, Alex accuses another soldier of being Alex Mercer, somehow instantly convincing surrounding allies to open fire on the luckless individual. This initially requires close contact with the victim, but can be upgraded to a simple point.</li><li><b>Air Strike</b> - Again only available in military disguise, Alex can radio in air support. Alex can only make so many calls, however, before he must consume a military commander to inexplicably restock the ability's uses.</li></ul><h3>Vehicular Skills</h3><ul><li><b>Jack Helicopters</b> - Once Alex has consumed a helicopter pilot, he can steal choppers from their pilots by leaping onto them as they are flying through the air. He can then fly around freely and use the copter's full arsenal against his enemies.</li><li><b>Jack Armour</b> - Once Alex has consumed a tank driver, he can steal <a href="../../tank/93-92/" rel="nofollow">tanks</a> and <a href="../../armored-personnel-carrier/93-645/" rel="nofollow">APCs</a> by jumping onto them, wrenching open the lid and killing everybody inside. After that, he can freely ride around and he obtains full access to the tank's variety of guns and cannons.</li></ul><h3><b>Devastator</b></h3><p style="">Devastator attacks can only be performed when Alex is in 'Critical Mass'. In order to reach Critical Mass, Alex must consume enough humans or infected to overfill his health bar. The Devastator attack will relieve Alex of this over burden of health, and the results are usually worth it. Each of the devastator attacks has an Air version, purchased separately, that can be executed while jumping or falling.</p><ul><li><b>Groundspike Graveyard</b> - A massive area of effect attack of spikes piercing out of the ground</li><li><b>Tendril Barrage</b> - Alex becomes the center point for a large explosions of tendrils that damage everything they touch.</li><li><b>Critical Pain</b> - The only devastator which is a directed attack; appears to be a horizontal tornado coming out of Alex.</li></ul><h2>PC System Requirements</h2><ul><li><b>OS:</b> Windows® XP (with Service Pack 3) or Windows Vista®</li><li><b>Processor:</b> Intel® Core™2 Duo 2.6 GHz or AMD Athlon™ 64 X2 4000 or better</li><li><b>Memory:</b> Vista 2 GB RAM / XP 1 GB RAM</li><li><b>Graphics:</b> All NVIDIA® GeForce® 7800 GT 256 MB and better chipsets.

It occurs outside of the "normal" continuity and has a much darker tone than the previous games.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Twisted Metal Black was a launch title for the <a href="/playstation-2/3045-19" data-ref-id="3045-19">PlayStation 2</a>. The tone of the game differs greatly from the previous games, with it opting for a much darker and 'twisted' style of storytelling. Every character is an inmate at Blackfield Asylum, and is visited by the mysterious <a href="/calypso/3005-2556" data-ref-id="3005-2556">Calypso</a> who promises to give them anything they want if they win his sadistic tournament.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p style="">The game follows the Twisted Metal tournament in which 15 psychotic mental patients from Blackfield Asylum compete to have any one of their wishes granted.</p><p style="">In Twisted Metal: Black, each of the involved characters has their own back story is narrated from their own perspective. Each of the stories begins with a visit from Calypso - the tournament's creator. Calypso is aware of these peoples' desires, and offers it to them through his contest. The characters include murderers, cannibal war veterans, psychotic brides, <a href="/sweet-tooth/3005-415" data-ref-id="3005-415">Sweet Tooth</a>, and many more, as listed below.</p><p style="">Mid-point cutscenes reveal more about each of the characters individually, as well as text during loading screens.</p><p style="">Completing the game with every character, including unlockable characters, unlocks Minion. Minion is somewhat different from the rest of the cast in that his loading screen text is in code. By following the logic of 1=A, 2=B, 3=C, etc, the following is revealed:</p><blockquote><p style="">I do not think this is real.</p><p style="">I must speak in code or he will discover me.</p><p style="">We are trapped in his head.</p><p style="">This is how he sees the world, how Sweet Tooth sees his life. It is not real.</p><p style="">All of us are trapped in his head.</p><p style="">I miss the old colorful world.</p><p style="">We will return to our world one day.</p><p style="">In the real world my name is Marcus Kane.</p></blockquote><p style="">Further evidence that the game takes place within Sweet Tooth's head is visible from the start. He's the only base character to be listed in the middle of the unlockable characters. His driver bio has him listed as extremely dangerous, something no other driver is. The entire game serves to inflate his ego.</p><h2>Characters</h2><h3>Sweet Tooth</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/110/223985-sweettooth_stalking.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-223985" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="1.1441441441441" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:114.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/110/223985-sweettooth_stalking.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-223985"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/110/223985-sweettooth_stalking.jpg"></a></figure><p style=""><a href="/sweet-tooth/3005-415" data-ref-id="3005-415">Sweet Tooth</a> is a psychopathic serial killer who wants nothing more than to kill.

Take on the role of new playable character Nero, as he uses his swanky demon arm to beat the hell out of a demon invasion in the castle town of Fortuna.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">The first appearance of the <a href="/devil-may-cry/3025-147" data-ref-id="3025-147">Devil May Cry</a> series on the 360 &amp; PS3 console hardware, Devil May Cry 4 once again let players step into the shoes of the demonic demon hunter <a href="/dante/3005-309" data-ref-id="3005-309">Dante</a>, as well as series newcomer (and Dante lookalike) <a href="/nero/3005-662" data-ref-id="3005-662">Nero</a>. This is the first entry of the franchise to appear on a <a href="/microsoft-game-studios/3010-340" data-ref-id="3010-340">Microsoft</a> console (excluding the <a href="/devil-may-cry-3-dantes-awakening/3030-890" data-ref-id="3030-890">DMC3</a> <a href="/pc/3045-94" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC</a> port). Devil May Cry 4 adds some small changes to the formula used in the last game, but doesn't stray far from its predecessors.</p><p style=""><a href="/devil-may-cry-4-special-edition/3030-48439" data-ref-id="3030-48439">Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition</a>, an enhanced port with additional playable characters and other new features, was released on the PS4, Xbox One and PC in 2015.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">The core gameplay in DMC4 remains unchanged from the previous installments; which means you kill demons as stylishly as possible by using fancy combos and agile acrobatic maneuvers. Both characters (Nero and later Dante) have a <a href="/sword/3055-1" data-ref-id="3055-1">sword</a> button and a <a href="/gun/3055-118" data-ref-id="3055-118">gun</a> button, and the two can alternate between the attacks on the fly. Sword attacks can be modified by the timing in which the button is pressed(holding the button as opposed to tapping the button as opposed to pressing the button and waiting a second), while gun attacks can be modified by charging the blast(which can be done by holding the gun button. Characters still lock onto enemies before attacking, and locking on allows players to launch opponents into the air, drive into them with the sword, or send them flying down to earth, depending on which direction the control stick is pressed while locked on. The player has control over the camera, but that control is frequently taken away by the game to show a more cinematic angle of a location and actually turning the camera takes a bit more time than in other games.</p><p style="">Nero has a few key differences from series hero Dante that change his combat style slightly. Firstly, Nero has the "Devil Bringer" a glowing, demonic right arm that allows him to grab opponents in combat and throw them(both on the ground and in the air). Nero can also pull opponents towards him from a distance by using the Devil Bringer while locked onto a target. The Devil Bringer in game boils down to another type of attack to use against enemies, but its more useful as a means of getting around larger opponents: Nero can latch onto opponents when throwing out a demonic projection of his devil arm and jump over the enemy, leaving them exposed to sword, gun and fists.</p><p style="">The Red Queen Sword is the blade Nero wields throughout the game. By holding the left trigger before or during combat (provided that Nero isn't performing any other combat action) will cause Nero to "rev" the Red Queen Sword(which can be seen in the top left corner of the screen) with blazing heat. If Nero charges the blade enough, he'll store a point of heat charge (called "Exceed" in the game) . Nero can rev and fill the sword with, initially, three Exceed points. When the sword has stored points, Nero's next sword attack will become faster and more powerful. However, there's only a one-shot charge to each point: the minute Nero swings his sword (in combat or out of combat, even if he isn't targeting an enemy) he will expend an Exceed point. Since players can't "rev" the sword in the middle of combat, players will have to decide whether to go into combat, or to lay off the offensive and charge the sword up before diving in. Players will also have to decide the best ways to use stored Exceed points, since they can be expended so quickly. Nero, however, has one trick up his sleeve when using the Red Queen's charging move: if the player presses the left trigger as his sword collides with a target he will instantly gain a point of Exceed charge, making his next attack faster and more powerful. Players can also utilize the advanced version of this skill by purchasing an upgrade that will completely max out the Exceed gauge if the left trigger is pressed at the exact time Nero's sword hits a target. This move will boost Nero's combat effectiveness, but the timing to nail the move will challenge even seasoned players. However, a player skilled using this move will, essentially, have unlimited Exceed charges, making them much more powerful in combat.</p><p style="">Additionally, Nero has a handful of abilities that, when used after building up one or more Exceed charges, become completely different abilities. These new abilities usually have a wider range and deal much more damage than their un-charged versions. The powered up abilities tend to have the prefix "Ex-" applied to their names as in Ex-Calibur, the powered up version of the ability "Calibur". There is also an ability that allows the player to expend all their built up Exceed points in one single, extremely powerful attack by using one of the "Ex-" abilities with a maxed Exceed gauge.</p><p style="">Nero, like Dante, can activate his "Devil Trigger", once he gets Yamato. This move will let Nero transform into his demon form for a brief period of time, making his attacks stronger and faster. By dispatching enemies with panache your style meter goes up, a high meter will net you more red orbs after you kill enemies. Red orbs are used to buy restorative items. There is another form of "currency" in DMC4 called proud souls. At the end of a level you're graded and your letter grade determines how much proud souls you get. These are used to buy new moves and abilities. DMC4 is also the first game in the series to allow the player "sell" purchased upgrades back. Any ability bought with Proud Souls can be exchanged for a refund equal to the cost of the upgrade. This allows players to customize their character's progression while allowing leeway for some experimentation.</p><p style="">In addition to its combat system there are also some segments of platforming and <a href="/puzzles/3015-932" data-ref-id="3015-932">puzzle</a> solving.</p><h3>Difficulty Levels</h3><p style="">The game can be played in many different difficulty modes.

As a beautiful young woman named <a href="/kyrie/3005-2903" data-ref-id="3005-2903">Kyrie</a> sings at his destination, Nero slays the demons with ease and style, before making his way to the House. When he arrives, he sits and as Kyrie approaches, it becomes evident the two have a relationship. Nero begins to express his boredom when suddenly his own Demon Arm begins to glow...</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/57856/1118568-devilmaycry4_dx9_2008_07_31_18_37_03_15.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1118568" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.6" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:60.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/57856/1118568-devilmaycry4_dx9_2008_07_31_18_37_03_15.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1118568"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/5/57856/1118568-devilmaycry4_dx9_2008_07_31_18_37_03_15.jpg"></a><figcaption>Nero fighting Berial</figcaption></figure><p style="">Crashing through the roof, <a href="/dante/3005-309" data-ref-id="3005-309">Dante</a> infiltrates the church and murders <a href="/sanctus/3005-3191" data-ref-id="3005-3191">Sanctus</a>, the High Priest of the Order of the Sword; a Pope-equivalent religious figure in this game's world. Nero, a member of the Order, understands the danger Kyrie is in and battles Dante, seemingly defeating him before Dante shows that he was just teasing Nero. Dante escapes and Nero leaves the church when he is assigned by <a href="/credo/3005-4580" data-ref-id="3005-4580">Credo</a>, the leader of the knights in the Order, to hunt down Dante. As Nero goes after Dante he learns more about the truth behind the Order and the leader Sanctus, he also begins to wonder if Dante is even the real threat. Pushing through the city, from it's urban areas to it's forested landscapes before finding himself at the Headquarters of the Order, Nero battles demons and learns that a distinctly despicable character named Agnus is conducting experiments regarding Demonology.</p><p style="">Later, when Nero makes it to the Order Credo appears and explains that his Holiness has been resurrected and has directed Credo to kill Nero. Transforming into an 'Angelic' version of himself, he battles Nero, who remarks that Credo is no angel, but a demon. After defeating Credo, Kyrie appears and is disturbed by Nero standing over a beaten Credo, baring his Demon Arm. Nero tries to convince her that she doesn't understand. At this point <a href="/agnus/3005-4196" data-ref-id="3005-4196">Agnus</a> appears and kidnaps Kyrie taking her to the highest confines of the Headquarters.</p><p style="">Fighting his way through headquarters, Nero eventually meets Dante again, who always seems to be one step ahead of Nero. Dante mentions that the sword Nero holds (which Nero found in Agnus' lair) belonged to his brother <a href="/vergil/3005-1804" data-ref-id="3005-1804">Vergil</a>, and that he wants to 'keep it in the family'. After a brief scuffle, Nero realizes that Dante is toying with him and Dante tells him to keep the sword. Nero proceeds without giving him the blade.</p><p style="">At the top of headquarters, Nero comes across his Holiness, Sanctus, who has gone so far as to bring a giant statue of Sparda (known as the Savior) to life in order to vanquish evil. Nero battles with Sanctus for Kyrie's soul and seems victorious, until the Savior finally manages to grab a hold of him. At this point, Dante appears and tells Nero to give him his sword back. Nero tells Dante to come and get it, before giving Dante the finger as he is forced into the Savior...</p><p style="">Inside the Savior, Nero finds Kyrie and reaches out but the moment he touches her, she appears to disintegrate into nothingness. Vowing to get the two of them out, Nero slips away, also.</p><p style="">Outside the Savior, however, Dante watches as Agnus summons all the demons of hell to wreak havoc over the great city. Suddenly, before anyone is hurt, a series of Angelic Guard creations and the Savior eradicate them all and the townspeople feel safe.

Developed for the PS2, it was released in Japan on December 8, 2005, and in North America on January 30, 2007. It was the last game reviewed by former GameSpot editor in chief <a href="/greg-kasavin/3040-78340" data-ref-id="3040-78340">Greg Kasavin</a> before he departed GameSpot to pursue a career in videogame development.</p><h2>Plot</h2><h3>Chapter I - Departure</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6246/328136-roguegalaxy71.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-328136" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.59548611111111" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:59.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6246/328136-roguegalaxy71.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-328136"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6246/328136-roguegalaxy71.jpg"></a><figcaption>Jaster tries to escape a large desert worm on Rosa</figcaption></figure><p style="">The story begins on the desert planet Rosa. It centers around a teenager named Jaster Rogue, who was abandoned on the planet at a very young age. He was raised by a priest named Raul who became like a father to him. Ever since he was young, Jaster dreamed of exploring the galaxy. That wish is fulfilled when a giant creature attacks his village. Jaster goes off to fight the creature, with an unknown ally at his side.</p><p style="">This unknown ally turns out to be Desert Claw, a famous hunter. He entrusts Jaster with his sword, the Desert Seeker, and leaves him to be discovered by a bumbling pair of space pirates. Believing that Jaster is in fact Desert Claw, the two ask him to join them on their journey throughout the galaxy. Jaster refuses at first, but then the two sides agree on destroying the monster before any talk about space travel.</p><p style="">After destroying the large monster, Jaster decides to accept the two pirates' offer, and the next day manages to get aboard the ship with the help of a beautiful pirate girl before they are all swallowed by a giant sand beast.</p><h3>Chapter II - The Jungle Planet</h3><p style="">Jaster is given a quick tour of the Dorgenark and its crew: the pudgy Simon, the helpful robot Steve, a gruff one-eyed hunter named Zegram, a talking cat first mate, and the girl who saved him back on Rosa named Kisala. She also reveals that she is Captain Dorgengoa's daughter. Suddenly, the ship is attacked by flying space-beasts and is forced to make a crash landing on the jungle planet Juraika.</p><p style="">After surviving the crash, Steve and Simon discover that they are stuck unless they can get their hands on a special oil that is not sold on the planet. Zegram points out that the oil comes from a special "Fire Fruit" native to Juraika, so he goes topside with Jaster and Kisala to find some Fire Fruit while the others make what repairs they can. As they venture through the jungle, Zegram notices that the Fire Fruit are strangely absent from the trees. Also, that they are heading near the territory of the Burkaqua Tribe native to Juraika, and are said to be hostile to outsiders. Nonetheless, Jaster decides to go seek their help, as they are out of other options.</p><p style="">The trio of pirates soon run into a Burkaqua tribeswoman talking with her sister, when a giant mutant frog attacks them all. Kisala manages to save the younger Burkaqua, but gets captured herself. After a grueling battle, the party defeats the beast and frees Kisala. As thanks the tribeswoman grants them access to her people's village. Also along the way, the pirates meet a strange tiny frog who hitches a ride with them in exchange for merging and improving their weapons.</p><p style="">As they reach the entrance to the village, the pirates discover that it has been shaken by a strange calamity, as one Burkaqua man dies right in front of them with strange dark lesions on his back.</p><h3>Chapter III - The Star God's Altar</h3><p style="">Jaster, Zegram and Kisala listen in on the village chief's council as he discusses the fate of their village. They have chosen to sacrifice Lilika's sister Iria to the "Star God" in order to stop the "Dark Fruit" that has been poisoning their people recently. Though Lilika has regrets about it, she decides to escort her sister to the altar the next morning. Zegram tells his comrades that they should be focusing on finding the Fire Fruit so they can repair their ship and escape Juraika, but Kisala and Jaster decide to stop the sacrifice instead, so Zegram grudgingly goes with them.</p><p style="">After a long trek and the discovery of some salvaged Zerardan technology, the party manages to reach the Altar of the Star God. However, Zegram disappears from the scene to communicate with an unknown party, so Jaster and Kisala continue ahead to rescue Iria. They find that the "Star God" is actually a giant beast, and Lilika soon recognizes that beast as the same one that killed her mother and blinded her sister. Enraged, she joins in attacking the beast until they manage to kill it.</p><p style="">For her actions against the Star God, the village chief banishes her from the tribe. Even though he knows the truth about the Star God, the council claims that the myth must remain even if the beast is dead. After leaving the village, Zegram returns to reveal that he acquired a canister full of the oil they need to finish repairing the Dorgenark. Lilika then appears on the path back to the ship and asks Jaster if she can go with them, to which he accepts.</p><h3>Chapter IV - The Great Escape</h3><p style="">With the Dorgenark repaired, the crew sets off for Zerard, the most technologically-advanced planet in the galaxy and home to the Longardia. The first mate gives Jaster a simple mission, to renew the Dorgenark's galactic travel visa. He sets out to reach the Galactic Headquarters with Simon and Lilika. However, upon arriving there, they find themselves blunted by the popular desk clerk Mio, when an explosion rocks the building. The guards immediately think that Jaster, Simon and Lilika are Draxian spies who planted the bomb, and throw them in Rosencaster Prison. Elsewhere, Zegram goes to work on his own personal mission, implying that he planted the bomb to frame his crewmates so they wouldn't interfere.</p><p style="">After meeting the titular warden of Rosencaster Prison, Jaster, Simon and Lilika are thrown into a cell on Level 4 when they meet an old cat-person who decides to break out of the cell with them. The group encounters a surprisingly-large amount of beasts within the prison walls as they make their way to the top to escape, including the large Salamander monster that Jaster killed back on Rosa. Eventually they find themselves in a room that shows Rosencaster has been using prisoners to conduct experiments in order to raise clone soldiers for Longardia, but also in hopes of finding a way to revive his dead wife Claudia. After fighting their way through Rosencaster himself, Jaster and his crew finally break free and return to the city, watching as the old cat-person leaves.</p><p style="">Making their way back to Galactic HQ, they discover that the cat-person was actually the Commander-in-Chief of the Longardian army who called for mutual disarmament with Draxia, and got thrown in a cell for his trouble. The party also stumbles across a mother and daughter looking for their missing husband. Simon abruptly decides to head back to the ship after seeing the photo, and subs in the robot Steve. When they go to get their galactic visa renewed, Mio tells them of a terrorist that has just taken over the Daytron mainframe, and no one can process their request until the situation is resolved, so Jaster, Steve and Lilika decide to take down the terrorist themselves.</p><h3>Chapter V - The Master Hacker</h3><p style="">As the party makes their way to the Daytron headquarters, they trick the security into letting them through by passing off Jaster as Desert Claw, letting him name his own reward for the successful capture of the terrorist Jupis Tooki. They enter the starship factory and fight their way through legions of security robots that have been hacked by Jupis to slow the party down. Eventually they rescue Dr. Poccaccio, another researcher who was also Steve's creator. The doctor begs the party to stop Jupis before any more damage is done.</p><p style="">Eventually the party comes face to face with Jupis himself, but Jupis pilots a large robot with an impenetrable barrier. However, Pocaccio shows up to give Jaster a pistol that can break through the barrier, and lets the party destroy Jupis's robot. Jupis finally gives up and explains why he hijacked the Daytron headquarters: he was on the verge of completing some important research project when his assistant stole his notes and sabotaged his computer, letting him take the blame for it. Rather than let himself get captured by Daytron security, Jupis tosses a smoke bomb and escapes. Pocaccio is able to reset the mainframe back to normal, and as thanks, Daytron lets Jaster use Pocaccio's factory to make whatever items he wants.</p><p style="">The party heads back to Galactic Headquarters for one last time, and Mio finally gives them a renewed galactic travel visa along with a membership card to her own fan club. They head back to the Dorgenark having finally accomplished their mission, only to find Jupis himself on board, still hiding from the local authorities. However, both the first mate and Kisala seem untroubled as they munch on some food that Jupis bribed them with, and let him stay.</p><p style="">Captain Dorgengoa himself shows up, an obese man chewing on a turkey leg (that Jupis also provided) to explain his master plan to the crew. He sees through Jaster's thinly-veiled attempt to pass himself off as the Desert Claw, having met the real Desert Claw before, but at his crew's pleading he allows Jaster to stay. He then reveals his plan to find the mythical lost planet of Eden that supposedly contains great treasure and the secret to eternal life, and says that one tablet that can lead to Eden was found on the planet Vedan, in the mining town of Myna.</p><h3>Chapter VI - The Guide</h3><p style="">As Jaster and Kisala head into Myna, they find themselves accosted by henchmen of local crimelord Dax Morarty, the man who supposedly has a lead on the tablet they are looking for. The two make their way to a local bar and find Deego, a muscular dog-person with a cybernetic arm and a former soldier, drinking his sorrows away. He decides to help the two of them find the mine that contains the tablet, but the group is impeded by his former comrade Gale. After picking up an ID card for the mine, the group discovers that someone has burned down the bar where Deego drank, but his girlfriend is fine.</p><p style="">Seeing the lengths that Gale would go to just to escape the planet, Deego decides to venture into the mine with Jaster and Kisala. Eventually, they find Gale waiting for him. Deego defeats him in a 1-on-1 fight, but Daytron manages to take the tablet before they can claim it. Deego decides to say goodbye to his girlfriend one last time before leaving with the crew of the Dorgenark. Meanwhile, Gale confronts Dax Morarty and manages to kill him for his treachery, but shortly after a former subordinate takes revenge on him as well.</p><h3>Chapter VII - Valkog's Ambition</h3><p style="">Daytron's CEO Valkog manages to sell the Longardian Empire on a new fleet of massive warships he dubs the Emperor class before returning to continue his plan to unite the tablets. Meanwhile, the Dorgenark has tracked the ship carrying the tablet from Myna back to Jaster's home planet of Rosa, so they land at the spaceport and decide to approach the ship on foot so as not to scare them into escaping again.</p><h2>Characters</h2><h3><a href="/jaster-rogue/3005-2875" data-ref-id="3005-2875">Jaster Rogue</a></h3><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15495/1095641-jaster.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1095641" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.56719817767654" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15495/1095641-jaster.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1095641"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15495/1095641-jaster.jpg"></a><figcaption>Jaster Rogue</figcaption></figure><p style="">The main character of Rogue Galaxy who was raised as an orphan on the desert planet Rosa, which was conquered by the Longardian Empire.

The battle system in Rogue Galaxy is real time, except for the times in battle when you can pause and use items,abilities, or switch your party members. As you fight battles, you gain Experience Points for both the characters and their weapons. When the characters level up they just become stronger all around, and when your weapon is leveled up to the max, you can merge it with another weapon to make an even better weapon. ( See Weapon Customization for more details)</p><h3>Combat</h3><p style="">There are six damage forms in Rogue Galaxy: a primary attack, a charged primary attack, a secondary attack, a throwing attack, spell damage, and a combo attack. The primary and secondary attack are the use of the (usually) short range and long range weapons equipped to your player though some characters have differing primary weapon ranges. The charged primary occurs when the player presses and holds the primary attack button until a blue flame surround his character. This charged attack is more powerful and can be used to break through shielded enemies. Secondary attacks are often used to boss specific combat. For example, Jaster obtains a Freeze gun that allows him to make a particular boss fight more manageable. All weapons gain levels with the character and can be used to develop more advanced weapons (See Weapon Customization)</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2570/496769-rogue_galaxy_20060425025407253.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-496769" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2570/496769-rogue_galaxy_20060425025407253.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-496769"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2570/496769-rogue_galaxy_20060425025407253.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2570/496769-rogue_galaxy_20060425025407253.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Battle Screenshot, showing Jaster, Lillika and Zegram</figcaption></figure><p style="">The throwing attack is the use of either background items or smaller enemies to inflict damage by hurling them into either a wall or another enemy. Throwing is the only command that can be done during the non-attack phase.</p><p style="">Spells in Rogue Galaxy are described as Abilities. Each character unlocks abilities by applying components collected throughout the game to a Final Fantasy 12-esque skill map. Abilities either cause damage to enemies, enhance player skills, or provide status bonuses to characters. One unlockable ability is a combo attack that the player can use when a combo meter fills. This attack requires the player to precisely time a series of button presses significant damage to the enemy.</p><h3>Weapon Customization</h3><p style="">Part way into the game, you obtain a little animal called 'Toady' who has magically gained the ability to speak and also combine two matured weapons into a third more usually more powerful weapon. When he joins your team (as a usable item in your items menu) you will gain the ability to perform this synthesis. A weapon synthesis can only occur for a primary or secondary weapon that has been completely leveled up. Toady gives two options when selected: "Analyze" and "Combine". Analyzing lets you determine the appropriate combination of matured weapons needed while combining actually performs the synthesis. Some of the time when you try to combine two weapons that are too similar, toady will give you a warning message, letting you re-think what you did.</p><h3>Item Creation (Factory Mini-Game)</h3><p style="">Item unlocking in Rogue Galaxy is handled through a Factory mini-game. Throughout the game players collect or purchase odd components used to level their character skills up (new spells, added status effects, etc). These same components are also used in the factory item creation mini-game. Before playing this mini-game the player must receive blueprints these are basically item recipes. A given recipes will call for a specified quantity of components. The "game" component applies in the manufacturing of the final item. Each component is given a specific category (metal, mineral, alchemy, etc) these components must be processed in special ways. For example, minerals must go through smelting, compressing, and cooling before they can be used. Each of the components are placed on a different assembly line path and the player must construct the appropriate processes before all the components are combined. The challenge comes in the timing of each process. Each process (e.g. smelting) takes a certain number of time units. The challenge with this game is to construct each assembly line such that all the required blueprint components will reach the final manufacturing stage simultaneously. This generally requires the use of special piping to slow the quicker processes down while the other components are going through their stages. After successfully completing a given blueprint, the item is purchasable at stores in the game. Several powerful in-game items are unlocked through this process.</p><h3>Party System</h3><p style="">Over the course of the game you can obtain a party of up to 8 characters, 3 of which that can be in your party at 1 time. While in Battle you can switch characters on the fly, issue commands to AI controlled party members, and use items without a wait time, making healing mid-battle quite a bit easier. During the game, while the characters in your immediate party gain the most experience, the ones that are on standby still gain experience, so you don't have to worry about anybody falling behind.</p><h3>Save System</h3><p style="">The save system in Rogue Galaxy is basically like any other JRPG, you can save at the points, and they heal your health. But in Rogue Galaxy, you can teleport from one save point to any other save point on that planet. This is especially useful during long dungeons, where you have to back track to get healing items to help beat the super-tough boss.</p><h3>Audio</h3><p style="">Rogue Galaxy features an impressive English voice cast including <a href="/will-friedle/3040-89813" data-ref-id="3040-89813">Will Friedle</a> who played Eric Matthews on Boy Meets World. Will does the voice of main character Jaster.

RPGFan in particular also criticized the poorly written dialogue that the otherwise solid voice actors had to act out.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>7940</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/2525235-box_rgalaxy.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/2525235-box_rgalaxy.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/2525235-box_rgalaxy.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/2525235-box_rgalaxy.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/2525235-box_rgalaxy.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2525235-box_rgalaxy.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/2525235-box_rgalaxy.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Rogue Galaxy]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>5</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-1/]]></api_detail_url><id>1</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: T]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-25/]]></api_detail_url><id>25</id><name><![CDATA[CERO: A]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-36/]]></api_detail_url><id>36</id><name><![CDATA[PEGI: 12+]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-38/]]></api_detail_url><id>38</id><name><![CDATA[OFLC: PG]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2005-12-08 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-19/]]></api_detail_url><id>19</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 2]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-2/3045-19/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS2]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/]]></api_detail_url><id>146</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 4]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS4]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/rogue-galaxy/3030-7940/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-10051/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-04-01 15:53:11</date_added><date_last_updated>2015-12-11 14:02:38</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[PaRappa the Rapper 2 is a PS2 rhythm game that follows PaRappa and his friends on a quest to save the world from  "Noodlization".]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<p style="">PaRappa the Rapper 2 is the sequel the Playstation's quirky music-rhythm game. The game continues the story of the lovable dog PaRappa and his girlfriend Sunny Funny. The gameplay uses timed button presses that are shown on a line at the top of the screen. The "Instructor" in each level will show you what buttons to press at each time and then you must copy him or her as close as possible. Another large feature of the game is the ability to freestyle. Instead of copying your instructor, you can press any combination of buttons that are in rhythm. The result of free styling can increase your in-game grade, which ranges from awful to cool. The only way to achieve the highest level, Cool, is to freestyle in rhythm. <br /><br />The story is about PaRappa winning a contest in which the prize is a lifetime supply of noodles. After having so many noodles, he is now very sick of them and wishes to eat another food. When his girlfriend Sunny makes him noodles, he runs away from her house and into the city. This sparks an inner conflict PaRappa has throughout the game about what it takes to be a man. Meanwhile, an evil villain is turning all of the world's foods into noodles, and it's up to PaRappa, his friend PJ, Sunny, and many more to save the world from "Noodlization". <br /><br />The game was not as well received as the original when it was released in January 2002. The complaint was that the sole game mechanic was becoming dated and the sequel did not change this mechanic enough. This was the last original PaRappa game that was created.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>10051</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/1881079-box_parappa2.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/1881079-box_parappa2.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/1881079-box_parappa2.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/1881079-box_parappa2.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/1881079-box_parappa2.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1881079-box_parappa2.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/1881079-box_parappa2.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[PaRappa the Rapper 2]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-6/]]></api_detail_url><id>6</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: E]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-7/]]></api_detail_url><id>7</id><name><![CDATA[PEGI: 3+]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2001-08-30 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-19/]]></api_detail_url><id>19</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 2]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-2/3045-19/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS2]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/]]></api_detail_url><id>146</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 4]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS4]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/parappa-the-rapper-2/3030-10051/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[BioHazard 0

It is also one of the last games in the main series to use the original control scheme &amp; design, with <a href="/resident-evil-outbreak-file-2/3030-15222" data-ref-id="3030-15222">Outbreak - File #2</a> being the very last.</p><p style="">It uses a team mechanic in which the player can control two characters in order to solve puzzles and defeat foes. A <a href="/wii/3045-36" data-ref-id="3045-36">Nintendo Wii</a> version of the game was released in 2009 and features minimal changes, the main change being that the game can be controlled with the <a href="/wii-remote/3055-1304" data-ref-id="3055-1304">Wiimote</a>. It was originally slated to come out for the <a href="/nintendo-64/3045-43" data-ref-id="3045-43">Nintendo 64</a> and up until 2016 was a Nintendo exclusive, before it was remastered for Sony and Microsoft consoles, and the PC.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Overview &amp; Controls</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2756622-44dcf011fb2d3585e949d5c639bda78c.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2756622" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2756622-44dcf011fb2d3585e949d5c639bda78c.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2756622"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2756622-44dcf011fb2d3585e949d5c639bda78c.jpg"></a></figure><p style="">Resident Evil Zero plays much like every other Resident Evil game pre-Resident Evil 4, mixing in third-person combat, exploration, and puzzles. Though like most survival horror titles, Resident Evil limits the player character's capabilities beyond the norm and ammunition for their firearms is generally scarce, intended to force players to use their supplies wisely and to choose flight rather than fight when possible. There are three different difficulty modes available: Easy, Normal, and Hard, with each one featuring tougher enemies and less ammunition to be found than the last.</p><p style="">By default Zero utilises the notorious '<a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/tank-controls/3015-4647" data-ref-id="3015-4647">tank controls</a>' as players move via a third-person perspective throughout a number of pre-determined camera angles. Characters also cannot move and fire their weapons at the same time, and instead the character will 'perch' themselves to the ground when aiming. And while the camera angle perspective sometimes tends to purposely obfuscate the player's view of monsters, characters will at least (by default) aim their weapon at the closest enemy when players draw their gun. Simultaneously hitting down and the 'run' button will have the player character do a 180 degree turn, as is custom with Resident Evil games since <a href="/resident-evil-3-nemesis/3030-5587" data-ref-id="3030-5587">Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</a>.</p><p style="">The story is largely portrayed via in-game cutscenes, however there are also a number of Files (diaries, memos ect.) players can collect. These will often provide additional insight into the goings on across the overall narrative, but some are more vital as they will provide information pertaining to solving puzzles or maybe hinting as to where to go next.</p><h3>Cooperative Functions</h3><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2756624-552c7b8c215efe3bff1609c84aa050e8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2756624" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2756624-552c7b8c215efe3bff1609c84aa050e8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2756624"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2756624-552c7b8c215efe3bff1609c84aa050e8.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2756624-552c7b8c215efe3bff1609c84aa050e8.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Zero's one primary component that separates it from previous games of the series is its two-protagonist setup--being Rebecca Chambers &amp; Billy Coen--each of whom can be controlled by the player. When controlling one the other will follow closely by default and will attack any encroaching enemies - though it will use up any ammo it has access to in the process. It will also fire alongside the player at whatever enemy they're targeted at, though its frequency of attack is rather slow. Such behaviour related to its attacking and following procedures can be turned off, so it will merely follow the player without engaging in combat and/or will wait on the spot. When travelling together the player can control the movement of the alternate character as well with the c-stick/right analogue stick (default GameCube/PlayStation &amp; Xbox controls), though the secondary character will only run via this method and cannot walk.</p><p style="">Rather than having both characters following one another, players can also split them up. When split up the secondary character will await in the area they're left in until the player takes control, though they're still vulnerable to attack should there be any nearby enemies. If the secondary character is being attacked then the player will receive a warning over their radio; if players don't switch to the alternate character to save them, there's a high chance they may perish. This function is forced upon the player so as to solve certain puzzles, such as by having one character access an area that only he/she can travel to, while the other sends key items and/or supplies via a dumbwaiter.</p><p style="">While the majority of the game plays out with these mechanics in play, there are two occasions where the characters are separated without the ability to switch between the two for the sake of the story. One sequence forces players to play as Billy, while another, much longer segment has players play as Rebecca on her own.</p><h3>Playable Characters</h3><p style="">Both Rebecca and Billy each have their own strengths and weaknesses to help distinguish the two. Due to his experience in the marines, Billy is significantly more durable than Rebecca and can withstand more damage before dying. His strength also allows him to interact with certain objects that Rebecca cannot, though the opposite is also true for Rebecca who can access certain areas that Billy cannot due to her smaller size.</p><p style="">Though Rebecca can't withstand nearly as much punishment as Billy, she is the only one of the two who can mix herbs, making Billy quite literally the only playable characters in the series who cannot mix herbs together. Her medicine case that she uses to mix herbs is also used for mixing certain chemicals to solve puzzles.</p><p style="">All weapons in the game can be used by both characters largely to the same effect.</p><h3>Inventory</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2768250-img-37.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2768250" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2768250-img-37.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2768250"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2768250-img-37.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2768250-img-37.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">The inventory system for Zero received a slight overhaul from previous games. Each of the two characters has their own six-slot inventory, to which they can trade items between each other at will so long as they're in the same room. However there are no <a href="/item-box/3055-6126" data-ref-id="3055-6126">item boxes</a> to be found in the game. Instead players can opt to drop items onto the ground, to which will persist there until/if it is collected. Any dropped items will also show up on the map.</p><p style="">Each character has their own personal item that's housed in a separate inventory slot - no other items can be exchanged into this slot. Rebecca has her medicine case, while Billy has a lighter.</p><p style="">All items and weapons can be examined by the player, allowing them to get a closer look and turn the object around. This can sometimes change the properties of certain key items, such as unlocking/opening a key item to reveal another inside, or may at least change the title to reflect the item's true identity.</p><p style="">Most items and weapons take up a single inventory slot, however there are a select few that require two to carry. These are:</p><ul><li>Hunting Gun</li><li>Shotgun</li><li>Grenade Launcher</li><li>Hookshot</li><li>Rocket Launcher</li></ul><h3>Health &amp; Herbs/First Aid Sprays</h3><p style="">A character's health can be seen via the inventory menu, with an Electrocardiograph Machine showing a character's status. The different statuses are:</p><ul><li><strong>Fine</strong> - The character is in good health.</li><li><strong>Caution</strong> - The character is roughly at half health.</li><li><strong>Danger</strong> - The character is approaching death.</li><li><strong>Poison</strong> - The character is poisoned and their health will slowly deplete.</li></ul><p style="">Besides the EKG, players may also note the character's stance. Whence the characters starts holding onto their hip, that is a sign that their health is at least in the Caution state, or may even be poisoned.</p><p style="">Carrying the tradition set by the original Resident Evil, characters use a small variety of <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/medical-herb/3055-566" data-ref-id="3055-566">herb</a>s to heal themselves and cure poisons. Though as mentioned before only Rebecca can mix herbs. <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/first-aid-spray/3055-619" data-ref-id="3055-619">First Aid Spray</a>s are also available, though they only have the singular purpose of healing the character fully. There exist three herb types, all of which can be combined in some way for different degrees of healing:</p><ul><li><b>Green Herb</b> - On its own will restore 25% of health.</li><li><b>Blue Herb</b> - On its own will cure poison, though will not restore any health.</li><li><b>Red Herb</b> - On its own does nothing.</li><li><b>Green + Green Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character by roughly 50% of health.</li><li><b>Green + Green + Green Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character completely, though not of any poisons.</li><li><b>Green + Blue Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character 25% of health and cure any poison.</li><li><b>Green + Green + Blue Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character 50% of health and cure any poison.</li><li><b>Green + Red Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character completely, though not of any poisons.</li><li><b>Green + Red + Blue Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character completely including poisons.</li><li><b>Red + Blue Herb</b> - Mixed will do nothing.</li></ul><h3>Saving</h3><p style="">Like every other main Resident Evil game pre-Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil Zero requires that players find one of the many typewriters located throughout the environments to save, and must also have at least one ink ribbon item in their character's inventory. However whereas Save Rooms would always be devoid of enemies in previous games, this isn't the case for Zero.</p><p style=""> </p><h2>Story</h2><h3>Main Characters</h3><h4>Rebecca Chambers</h4><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2757999----render2---a3uch.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2757999" data-ratio="2.24125" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:224.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2757999----render2---a3uch.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2757999"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2757999----render2---a3uch.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2757999----render2---a3uch.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">The youngest member of STARS at only eighteen and one of two protagonists, Rebecca serves as the medic for Bravo team.

That it is Billy that suggests they team up to better their chances in surviving the hordes is the first of many hints that he may not be quite the monster his criminal record implies.</p><p style="">As the game progresses, Billy is shown to exhibit a quiet sensitivity about him.

The S.T.A.R.S. Bravo team is dispatched to the <a href="/arklay-mountains/3035-387" data-ref-id="3035-387">Arklay Mountains</a> to investigate and find the cause of the murders that have recently occurred. While over the forest the Bravo team's helicopter is mysteriously forced to crash land. Upon leaving the crash site, the Bravo team discovers an overturned Military Police vehicle, as well as orders for the transport of a prisoner to be executed.</p><p style="">Rookie team medic <a href="/rebecca-chambers/3005-1306" data-ref-id="3005-1306">Rebecca Chambers</a> discovers the Ecliptic Express stopped and without power in the middle of the forest. Upon entering the train, Rebecca encounters numerous zombies, and infected canine. Pressing further throughout the train, Rebecca meet <a href="/billy-coen/3005-3137" data-ref-id="3005-3137">Billy Coen</a>, the prisoner that was being transported to his execution. With little control over the recent events, Rebecca reluctantly agrees to team up with Billy, to get to safer ground, still vowing to bring him into custody if they both make it out alive. Further exploring Billy and Rebecca meet what appears to be a possible survivor, but before getting too close they find out it is a humanoid leech. Billy disposes of the leech creature, afterwords they see a lone man outside of the train standing on a cliff who appears to have some sort of control over the leeches. Unable to identify the mysterious individual, they must find a way to restore power to the train and get out of the forest. Once, power is finally returned to the locomotive, the train speeds to an unknown destination and eventually derails.</p><p style="">Seemingly unscathed from the train crash Rebecca and Billy end up at the trains destination. The mansion like building, is actually revealed to be a training facility for new employees of the <a href="/umbrella-corporation/3015-204" data-ref-id="3015-204">Umbrella Corporation</a>, and upon entering they are welcomed with a pre-recorded message from the head of the facility, <a href="/james-marcus/3005-4575" data-ref-id="3005-4575">James Marcus</a>. During their trek through the training facility the pair is face with numerous zombies as well as plenty of new abominations. Over the course of their time together, Rebecca begins to see that Billy isn't a quite the criminal type, and begins to wonder why he was sentenced to be executed. The two eventually discover an underground portion of the training facility and are separated when the floor that Rebecca is standing on collapses. After being rescued by Billy, she questions him about what he did to get the sentence he had been handed. Billy finally explains, that he was part of the <a href="/united-states-marine-corps/3015-2241" data-ref-id="3015-2241">USMC</a> (United States Marine Corps) and during a mission in Africa, his commanding officer ordered them to exterminate civilians of an African village that was suffering from a civil war. Billy refused to follow the orders, and once the information proved to be false, the slaughter was blamed entirely on him.</p><p style="">Upon entering an abandoned sewage treatment plant, the duo encounter James Marcus. Marcus, had been monitoring Coen and Chamber's progress throughout the training facility as well as the other areas they visited. Marcus reveals that a decade ago <a href="/ozwell-e-spencer/3005-10018" data-ref-id="3005-10018">Lord Ozwell E. Spencer</a> has Marcus assassinated, in the midst of the research on his leech research. He explains that the Queen leech from his experiments crawled into his mouth after he was shot, and the T-Virus that the leech was injected with was able to resurrect Marcus. Midway through his speech, the Queen leech takes over Marcus' body, and causes him to mutate into a new type of leech monstrosity. After toppling the Queen leech, Rebecca and Billy escape the training facility just as it is rocked by a gigantic explosion. After the escape, Rebecca takes Billy's dog tags as "proof" that he didn't survive the incident, and then the pair amicably part ways. In the distance Rebecca is able to see the <a href="/spencer-mansion/3035-563" data-ref-id="3035-563">Spencer mansion</a>.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><h3>Samurai Edge</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2768783-2668281-500px-re0_stars_handgun.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2768783" data-ratio="0.782" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:78.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2768783-2668281-500px-re0_stars_handgun.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2768783"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2768783-2668281-500px-re0_stars_handgun.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2768783-2668281-500px-re0_stars_handgun.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Rebecca's own custom STARS-branded handgun.

It is the most powerful weapon in the game, with it being able to kill nearly all common enemies with a single shot, and is a great contender for boss fights. Its one drawback is ammunition is extremely scarce.</p><p style="">When wielded by Rebecca the weapon undergoes a decrease in its firing rate due to Rebecca's inability to handle the recoil.

Molotovs are primarily useful for fending off the leech zombies, however it has a noticeable animation windup whence thrown and can be difficult to accurately throw it to where the player wants.

Slow and sluggish in movement, but dangerous up close, zombies are durable enough against gunfire that they can prove to be extremely dangerous even just in small numbers, especially due to the typically claustrophobic environments. When encountered on their own, however, zombies can be dispatched relatively easy so long as the player has enough ammunition to spare. As per usual, zombies are best dealt with the pistol or sometimes the shotgun, which can kill a zombie with a single shot if the player aims directly at its head once close enough, or can at least reduce the zombie to a literal crawl by destroying its legs.</p><p style="">Zombies attack by grabbing and biting the player when close, but will also puke out acid instead if they can't quite reach the player. Some zombies will be encountered lying on the ground, seemingly pretending to be dead, and will grab at a character's leg should the player get close enough. However, the leg bite does little damage and will always result in the character killing the zombie with a single stomp or kick.</p><h3>Cerberus Dogs</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2768794-re0cerberus.png" data-ref-id="1300-2768794" data-ratio="1.6523297491039" data-width="279" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 279px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:165.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2768794-re0cerberus.png" data-ref-id="1300-2768794"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2768794-re0cerberus.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2768794-re0cerberus.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Alongside regular zombies, some sort of iteration surrounding infected dogs have persisted across nearly every Resident Evil game to date. Starting at the beginning, so to speak, the Cerberus Dogs of Resident Evil Zero are infected Doberman breeds, purposely engineered to be a form of B.O.W. Cerberus dogs retain the same agility and tenacity as a regular dog, though with a massive increase in aggressiveness, brutality, and stamina.</p><p style="">Like zombies, Cerberus dogs are best left for lesser weaponry like the pistols and shotguns. Running past is always an option as well, as both Rebecca and Billy are just ever so slightly faster than the canines. However their attacks can sometimes cover just enough distance to close the gap and catch the player character.</p><h3>Crows</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2768795-crowre0_0.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2768795" data-ratio="1.0733944954128" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:107.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2768795-crowre0_0.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2768795"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2768795-crowre0_0.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2768795-crowre0_0.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">As always, crows prove to be more of a nuisance than a genuine threat. They do minimal damage and can often be killed with a single bullet; their numbers are always many, however. Sometimes a shotgun blast might be worth it to take a pack down, but otherwise they're best just ignored.</p><p style="">They only have one attack by way of pecking at the player, which while does little damage will keep the player stuck in a short animation of trying to wave them off.</p><h3>Bats</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2768828-bats2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2768828" data-ratio="0.85625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:85.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2768828-bats2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2768828"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2768828-bats2.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2768828-bats2.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Somewhat similar to crows, bats also function more so to harass than pose any serious threat. In fact bats are even less threatening than the crows as their attacks don't force the player into a prolonged animation of waving them away.</p><h3>Leechs</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2768829-hillleechuc_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2768829" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2768829-hillleechuc_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2768829"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2768829-hillleechuc_1.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2768829-hillleechuc_1.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Another minor enemy, most prominently featured in the beginning train section. Leechs pose little threat overall and can be killed merely by the character walking over them.

They will usually be of the appearance of James Marcus before then being shown to vibrate and revealing their true appearance. Leech zombies are perhaps the most difficult enemy in the game, as their movement speed is fast enough to catch up to the player, their regular attacks can be stretched out to attack from afar, and their close-range bites deal much more damage than of a regular zombie.</p><p style="">They are also highly resistant to most forms of damage - that is besides fire, which will make quick work of them should players have any molotovs or flame rounds for the grenade launcher. If killed by any other means beyond fire, then the leech zombie will explode, dealing a great amount of damage if its radius reaches the characters. It will at least begin to shake as a warning to players that it's about to explode.</p><p style="">Whenever a leech mimic appears it will be accompanied by its musical theme.</p><p style=""> </p><h2>Unlockables</h2><h3>Costumes</h3><p style="">A single completion of the game will award players with some new costumes. Billy gains one, <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/images/1300-2768253" data-ref-id="1300-2768253">being an Italian suit w/ shades</a>, while Rebecca gains two.

The concept is that Billy and Rebecca must collect a certain amount of color-coded, leech-themed jewellery pieces before exiting out the Umbrella Research Facility front door. When collecting leeches it can only be done specifically for each character, blue for Billy and green for Rebecca, but they cannot swap using the exchange system or pick up the opposite color for their team mate. The unlockable costumes as noted above are available to wear in Leech Hunter as well.</p><p style="">There are a number of unlockable rewards available for the main game, which are unlocked depending on how many leech pieces the player collects upon exiting the facility. If one of the character dies then the player's progress is forfeited. A list of the rewards is as such:</p><ul><li><strong>0-29</strong> - Submachine gun ammo.</li><li><strong>30-59</strong> - Infinite handgun ammunition.</li><li><strong>60-89</strong> - Infinite Hunting Gun ammunition.</li><li><strong>90-99</strong> - Magnum Revolver is added for collection in Second Class Private Room B.</li><li><strong>100</strong> - Infinite ammunition for all weapons.</li></ul><h2>HD Remastered Port</h2><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2756620-0e798a16a73b97bdd754714dc33f802f.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2756620" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2756620-0e798a16a73b97bdd754714dc33f802f.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2756620"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2756620-0e798a16a73b97bdd754714dc33f802f.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2756620-0e798a16a73b97bdd754714dc33f802f.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Following the success of the <a href="/resident-evil/3030-27715" data-ref-id="3030-27715">Resident Evil</a> remake remastering, a similar such remastering was announced for Resident Evil Zero on May 26th, 2015 for an early 2016 release.

Development of Resident Evil Zero began in the Summer of 1998.</p><p style="">Much of what was developed for the prototype persists in the full retail release, such as the two-protagonist setup of Rebecca &amp; Billy, it beginning on the Ecliptic Express train, and the death of Edward as he leaps through the window. Though there are certain features planned for the prototype that never made it into the full game; most notably is how one of the two protagonists could die, but the game wouldn't end unless both Rebecca &amp; Billy perish. This idea was scrapped due to how Rebecca canonically dying would conflict against her appearance in the original Resident Evil. 'Running zombies' was another idea that was scrapped for RE0, though would pave the way for the design of the Crimson Heads in the Resident Evil remake.</p><p style="">During development for Zero's remastered release, Capcom released footage of RE0's prototype version to the public. It was shown to still be using the zombie moan fxs from Resident Evil 2, likely due to Resident Evil 2 being ported to the N64 years before. Billy's voice actor is also noted as the same one that would voice him in the full release.</p><p style="">Weirdly enough Rebecca is also shown to be wearing a beret, which is more so recognizable as the iconic hat of choice for Jill Valentine in her STARS uniform. There also exists concept art of Rebecca wearing a beret as well, despite the fact that she has never been depicted wearing such an item before in the series. Though it's possible that she was to lose the beret during the events of RE0. Nonetheless, she was once again designed to be beret-less for the full GameCube release.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>10247</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/82063/2566511-re0.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82063/2566511-re0.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/82063/2566511-re0.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2566511-re0.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/82063/2566511-re0.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/82063/2566511-re0.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/82063/2566511-re0.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Resident Evil Zero]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>1</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-27/]]></api_detail_url><id>27</id><name><![CDATA[CERO: C]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-16/]]></api_detail_url><id>16</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: M]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-5/]]></api_detail_url><id>5</id><name><![CDATA[BBFC: 15]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-12/]]></api_detail_url><id>12</id><name><![CDATA[OFLC: MA15+]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-32/]]></api_detail_url><id>32</id><name><![CDATA[CERO: D]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2002-11-10 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-23/]]></api_detail_url><id>23</id><name><![CDATA[GameCube]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/gamecube/3045-23/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[GCN]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-36/]]></api_detail_url><id>36</id><name><![CDATA[Wii]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/wii/3045-36/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[Wii]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-86/]]></api_detail_url><id>86</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360 Games Store]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360-games-store/3045-86/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[XBGS]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-88/]]></api_detail_url><id>88</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation Network (PS3)]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-network-ps3/3045-88/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3N]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-145/]]></api_detail_url><id>145</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox One]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-one/3045-145/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[XONE]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/]]></api_detail_url><id>146</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 4]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS4]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/resident-evil-zero/3030-10247/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-10701/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-04-01 15:56:07</date_added><date_last_updated>2015-11-29 09:27:02</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[Swing a blade and toss shuriken at enemies in this arcade action game from Taito.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">The Legend of Kage is a level-based arcade action game that allows the player to jump up into the trees, swing a blade, and toss <a data-ref-id="3055-51" href="/shuriken/3055-51">shuriken</a> at opposing fighters.

Though most of the screen was a static black, on the bottom half of the screen the player could see the horizon of whichever planet they were on rushing towards them, including various geographical fixtures whizzing past in a manner similar to <a data-ref-id="3015-2915" href="/parallax-scrolling/3015-2915">parallax scrolling</a>.</p><p style="">The game is an example of an early shoot-em-up: There are no power-ups, just waves of enemies. Players had a limited number of lives and had to start over once they ran out. Enemies, rather than departing the screen upon passing the player's ship, would home in towards them in order to collide with and destroy them: The player had to circle back around and maneuver underneath the enemies in order to shoot them down.</p><p style="">Exerion had four versions: The original 1983 arcade version, its initial MSX home version of the following year, a Sega SG-1000 version and an eventual Famicom version in 1985. The Famicom version would also be rereleased on the Wii Shop's Virtual Console decades later. The arcade version, though the best looking, was also the hardest to play as the ship had a strong sense of inertia and momentum to it, making it sluggish to move and difficult to control. The home versions were better regarded.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>11700</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/5/56971/1494810-exerion_box_art.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/56971/1494810-exerion_box_art.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/5/56971/1494810-exerion_box_art.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/5/56971/1494810-exerion_box_art.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/5/56971/1494810-exerion_box_art.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/5/56971/1494810-exerion_box_art.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/5/56971/1494810-exerion_box_art.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Exerion]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating/><original_release_date>1985-02-11 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-15/]]></api_detail_url><id>15</id><name><![CDATA[MSX]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/msx/3045-15/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[MSX]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-21/]]></api_detail_url><id>21</id><name><![CDATA[Nintendo Entertainment System]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-21/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[NES]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-84/]]></api_detail_url><id>84</id><name><![CDATA[Arcade]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/arcade/3045-84/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[ARC]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-87/]]></api_detail_url><id>87</id><name><![CDATA[Wii Shop]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/wii-shop/3045-87/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[WSHP]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-141/]]></api_detail_url><id>141</id><name><![CDATA[Sega SG-1000]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/sega-sg-1000/3045-141/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[SG1K]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/]]></api_detail_url><id>146</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 4]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS4]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/exerion/3030-11700/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[Crimson Land]]></aliases><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-11758/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-04-01 16:00:56</date_added><date_last_updated>2015-09-08 03:18:45</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[A top-down shooter where the goal is for players to defend themselves from waves upon waves of enemies, using an assortment of increasingly powerful weapons.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Crimsonland is a simple <a href="/top-down-perspective/3015-788" data-ref-id="3015-788"> top-down</a> shooter in which, depending on the mode, the player attempts to survive as long as possible or through multiple waves of enemies</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Crimsonland starts the player in the middle of the screen, and creatures begin swarming the player soon after the level starts. The player must avoid being completely overrun and killed by running around the screen and shooting the enemies, which may drop <a href="/power-up/3015-700" data-ref-id="3015-700"> power-ups</a> and weapons that increase the player's power.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The player aims with the mouse, pointing a reticle in the direction he wants to shoot. Movement is handled with WASD or arrow keys. The control scheme is similar to some PC adaptations of dual-joystick shooters. If the level chosen is a campaign level, the player must survive until the waves of enemies stop. If it is challenge mode, then the player must survive as long as possible.

The player is stuck in the middle of the screen, unable to move. The incoming creatures have a label with a single word chosen from a random assortment words that must be typed in to kill that assailant. As the player progresses, longer and harder words are given and enemies attack faster and faster. If an enemy reaches the player and they are not shot off before they deplete the player's HP, the player loses.</p><h2>Game Modes</h2><h3>Quests</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Quest mode consists of 50 levels, split into five chapters, each level getting progressively harder. The player begins each level with only a pistol, but as more and more levels are completed more weapons and power-ups become available. There is also "Hardcore" mode that is unlocked after beating all of the levels in normal; this is similar to normal, except more enemies appear.</p><h3>Rush</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Players encounter a large amount of enemies, and only have a assault rifle to fend them off with. There are no <a href="/perks/3015-366" data-ref-id="3015-366"> perks</a> or power-ups in this mode, the goal is to survive as long as possible.</p><h3>Survival</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0"

The game is credited for revolutionizing the role-playing genre, and many of today's Role Playing Games use the story- and <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/cutscene/3015-22" data-ref-id="3015-22">cutscene</a>-heavy model as a blueprint. The game originally shipped on three CDs. The extra space was required for the game's pre-rendered video content. Though role-playing games had an American audience throughout the 8- and 16-bit eras, many credit Final Fantasy VII for the genre's current level of popularity, as the game's pre-rendered <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/full-motion-video/3015-604" data-ref-id="3015-604">Full Motion Video</a> (FMV) cutscenes and wide epic scope were unlike anything that had come before it.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">It has retrospectively been acknowledged as the game that popularized <a title="Role-playing game" href="/rpg-elements/3015-3603" data-ref-id="3015-3603">role-playing games</a> outside of Japan, and as the <a title="PlayStation" href="/playstation/3045-22" data-ref-id="3045-22">PlayStation</a>'s killer app that cemented its lead over other fifth-generation consoles.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Its critical and commercial success paved the way for the rise of cinematic storytelling in the video game industry. Final Fantasy VII also played an instrumental role in the PlayStation's sales victory over the <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-64/3045-43" data-ref-id="3045-43">Nintendo 64</a>; it was originally intended for the N64, but due to its cartridge limitations, Final Fantasy VII instead moved to the PlayStation.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Final Fantasy VII revolves around a company named <a href="../../shinra-electric-power-company/92-53/" rel="nofollow">Shinra</a> that is drawing from the very life of the planet to create energy called <a href="../../mako/92-1241/" rel="nofollow">Mako</a> to power its technology. This process is causing widespread ecological problems. The main character, <a href="../../cloud-strife/94-321/" rel="nofollow">Cloud Strife</a>, is a mercenary. He is hired by a rebel group, <a href="../../avalanche/92-1506/" rel="nofollow">AVALANCHE</a> , to destroy Shinra's <a href="../../mako-reactor/93-990/" rel="nofollow">Mako reactors</a> in an attempt to slow down the planet's decay. Fellow Avalanche members <a href="../../tifa-lockhart/94-803/" rel="nofollow">Tifa Lockhart</a> and <a href="../../barret-wallace/94-795/" rel="nofollow">Barret Wallace</a> join Cloud even after his quest takes his focus away from Shinra. Along the way, Cloud and his group discover that Mako comes from the life energy of the planet, called the <a href="../../lifestream/92-1509/" rel="nofollow">Lifestream</a>. When the planet is injured, the energy from the Lifestream focuses on that injury to heal the planet. To make things even more troubling, <a href="../../sephiroth/94-511/" rel="nofollow">Sephiroth</a>, Cloud's former partner and the most powerful <a href="../../soldier/92-1237/" rel="nofollow">SOLDIER</a> on the planet, plans to cause a planet-wide catastrophe by summoning <a href="../../meteor/93-1142/" rel="nofollow">Meteor</a> to crash into the earth so he can draw all the Mako energy released to himself and gain god-like power.</p><h2>Combat</h2><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3689/207912-ffvii_8__before.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-207912" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3689/207912-ffvii_8__before.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-207912"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3689/207912-ffvii_8__before.jpg"></a><figcaption>PHS: changing the party lineup.</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Final Fantasy VII introduced an updated version of the combat system from previous Final Fantasy titles. It used 3-dimensional graphics to bring new life to the turn-based combat system of 8 and 16-bit Role Playing Games. Utilizing the <a href="../../active-time-battle/92-95/" rel="nofollow">Active Time Battle</a> system (ATB) introduced in Final Fantasy IV, players must make their decisions quickly in battle, as enemies will attack whether or not the player acts. The player may choose two characters to accompany the main character, Cloud, in battle.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Final Fantasy VII introduced the <a href="/materia/3055-27" data-ref-id="3055-27">Materia</a> system. Players collect magical orbs of pure Mako energy that contain magic. They would level up along with the characters, getting stronger, introducing better and more advanced moves and eventually even spawning another orb of the same name. Players attach Materia to the available slots on the two types of equipment (Weapons/Accessory) any of the characters have on at the time. Depending on the types of slots (single/combined) players could create some powerful combinations of magic characters can use to devastate the battlefield.</p><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3689/207910-ffvii_7__before.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-207910" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3689/207910-ffvii_7__before.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-207910"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3689/207910-ffvii_7__before.jpg"></a><figcaption>A combat sequence in action.</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">For example, a combined Materia slot could have the magic "Bolt" in one side and "All" on the other, creating a magic attack that would strike all the enemies on the screen at once with electricity. Some of the more powerful Materia in the game required many hours of searching or side-questing. These were usually worth seeking because they allowed players to perform some of the more powerful moves in the game. Special weapons like Apocalypse, Scimitar and accessories also had the ability to gain double, or even triple AP, allowing the player to level Materia more quickly. Many of the more powerful types of Materia would summon creatures to attack enemies.</p><h3>Materia</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">In general, purple Materia enhance the character's Status; blue Materia are effective when used paired with other Materia in linked slots. and yellow Materia increase the number of commands that can be used.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Interdependent (purple)</th><th>Support (blue)</th><th>Command (yellow)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cover</td><td>All</td><td>Steal</td></tr><tr><td>Chocobo Love</td><td>Elemental</td><td>Sense</td></tr><tr><td>Long Range</td><td>Added Effect</td><td>Enemy Skill</td></tr><tr><td>Counter</td><td>HP Absorb</td><td>Throw</td></tr><tr><td>Enemy Lure</td><td>MP Absorb</td><td>Manipulate</td></tr><tr><td>Speed Plus</td><td>Added Cut</td><td>Deathblow</td></tr><tr><td>MP Plus</td><td>MP Turbo</td><td>Morph</td></tr><tr><td>HP Plus</td><td>Steal as Well</td><td>Double Cut</td></tr><tr><td>Luck Plus</td><td>Magic Counter</td><td>Master Command</td></tr><tr><td>Magic Plus</td><td>Final Attack</td><td>Slash-All</td></tr><tr><td>Gil Plus</td><td>Quadra Magic</td><td>Mime</td></tr><tr><td>Pre-Emptive</td><td>Sneak Attack</td><td>X-Magic</td></tr><tr><td>Exp.

Sephiroth fell from grace when he discovered his true origins and the circumstances surrounding the way he was actually 'made'. While he was in the womb of <a href="/lucrecia-crescent/3005-3070" data-ref-id="3005-3070">Lucrecia</a> (his mother) he was injected with <a href="/jenova/3005-4832" data-ref-id="3005-4832">Jenova</a> cells - Jenova being an alien life form that is often mistaken as a member of the <a href="/cetra/3015-1740" data-ref-id="3015-1740">Cetra</a>, or the first humans to have lived on the planet. When Sephiroth found out he was a creation of Shinra, he lost his mind. He assumed himself to be an Ancient as Jenova was his actual mother. With this in mind he plotted a scheme to become god and exact his revenge on mankind. He planned to do this by calling <a href="/meteor/3055-1142" data-ref-id="3055-1142">Meteor</a> (the black Materia) to destroy the planet. When Meteor hits the planet the Lifestream will expel an incredible amount of energy to heal the shattered planet. Sephiroth's goal is to become one with the life energy, thus becoming a god.

Two thousand years before the games main events Jenova crash landed on the planet on a meteor. On the planet the Cetra, i.e. the ancients, were inhabiting at the time, Jenova used its abilities to trick the Cetra, killing them off one by one. In a desperate struggle, the remaining Cetra used all their power and locked away the life form in the Northern Crater (which was created when Jenova landed there in the first place). In the present day Jenova was rediscovered by Professor Gast and mistook as a Cetra. He used the Jenova life form in a project called 'The Jenova Project' where Jenova Cells were infused inside Lucrecia's womb. This is when Sephiroth was born. Jenova was stored at the Shinra Headquarters at the start of the game, and from there Sephiroth dragged it away and kept the head with him.</p><ul><li><a href="../../rufus-shinra/94-2651/" rel="nofollow">Rufus Shinra</a> ( <a href="../../shinra-electric-power-company/92-53/" rel="nofollow">Shinra Co.</a>)</li></ul><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Rufus Shinra was 25 years old at the start of Final Fantasy VII.

The game was originally planned as a 2D game on the SNES, that was not the only major change to how the game eventually turned out. The Creator of Final Fantasy, <a href="../../hironobu-sakaguchi/72-633/" rel="nofollow">Hironobu Sakaguchi</a> originally intended for the game to take place in present day New York City. Development on the game was stalled, due to priority going over to the <a href="../../chrono-trigger/61-9249/" rel="nofollow">Chrono Trigger</a> project that was being developed at the same time.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Development recommenced later on in 1995. The original script saw a major overview, with a detective story theme being cast aside and co-director, <a href="../../yoshinori-kitase/72-634/" rel="nofollow">Yoshinori Kitase</a>, pushed for the game to go 3D for concerns that the series would be left behind back in the 2D era. Also, it was decided to make the game for Nintendo’s next console, the N64. Though due to FFVII’s ambitious design, Square expressed concerns to Nintendo over their decision to use cartridges instead of a new format capable of storing much more information, called CD-ROM’s, on their new console. This dispute continued and led to Square announcing on the 12 of January 1996, that it would be dropping relations with Nintendo and developing FFVII on Sony’s debut console, the Playstation. A reported $45,000,000 was spent over the extent of the games development.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Development required the efforts of approximately 120 artists and programmers, using PowerAnimator and Softimage 3D software.

They stated described it as "a classic that touched an entire genre of gaming" and "an entire generation of gamers." They also stated that its "status as an early PlayStation One exclusive gave <a title="Sony" href="/sony-corporation/3010-3223" data-ref-id="3010-3223">Sony</a> the edge it needed to compete in and eventually dominate the video game industry."</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Final Fantasy VII has also often placed at or near the top of many reader polls of all-time best games. Most recently, in 2014, <a title="Sony Computer Entertainment" href="/sony-computer-entertainment-incorporated/3010-995" data-ref-id="3010-995">Sony Computer Entertainment</a> conducted a <a href="http://www.dualshockers.com/2014/12/02/sony-releases-ranking-of-favorite-playstation-games-of-all-time-in-japan-final-fantasy-vii-most-wanted-remake/" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">poll with over 10,000 Japanese fans</a>, where Final Fantasy VII was voted the second favorite PlayStation game of all time (behind <a title="Dragon Quest V: Hand of the Heavenly Bride" href="/dragon-quest-v-hand-of-the-heavenly-bride/3030-7197" data-ref-id="3030-7197">Dragon Quest V: Hand of the Heavenly Bride</a>), the second best game that impressed "more than a movie or a novel" (behind <a title="Final Fantasy X" href="/final-fantasy-x/3030-11237" data-ref-id="3030-11237">Final Fantasy X</a>), and the most wanted <a title="Remake" href="/remake/3015-340" data-ref-id="3015-340">remake</a>.</p><h2>Availability on the PlayStation Network</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">On April 10th 2009, Final Fantasy 7 was released onto the Japanese PSN Store for 1,500 Yen. On June 3rd 2009, Final Fantasy 7 was released for the European and American PSN stores for €9.99 and $9.99 respectively. This announcement was made days before during Sony's press conference of E3 2009. June 4th Marked the release of FF7 on the UK PSN store for the price of £7.99.</p><h2>PC Releases and Requirements</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Final Fantasy VII was published for Windows 95 by Eidos not long after the original Playstation release, in June of 1998, coming on multiple CDs like its console counterpart did. This version was largely intact in comparison to the console release, with a few differences:</p><ul><li>Polygonal graphics were smoother, employing texture filtering and taking advantage of the PC's higher resolution, if you had a 3D accelerator</li><li>Pre-rendered graphics appeared grainier due to the low resolution of the renders juxtaposed with higher native resolution of computer monitors</li><li>Soundtrack was output in MIDI format; quality of orchestration was thus dependent on the PC's sound card (a hack was later made available to import the Playstation sound file library such that the music was rendered to sound exactly how it did on consoles)</li><li>Localization was cleaned up, removing the poor grammar, missing words, and misspellings of the original console release</li><li>Game's aesthetics were moddable, thanks to homebrew hacks, such that different character models, combat areas and sound themes could be applied providing for a more modern look and feel</li></ul><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Square Enix then re-released this PC version in August of 2012, exclusively from its online store as a digital download. The differences between console version and initial PC release apply with this re-release as well; in other words, backgrounds are still low-res and music is still MIDI. With this re-release, the following further changes apply:</p><ul><li>36 achievements are integrated into the game</li><li>Character booster gives players the option to increase their character stats and money without restriction should they desire to just play through the plot (i.e. cheat through the game)</li><li>Support for cloud saves</li><li>The game is no longer moddable natively and must undergo a total conversion process to the "old" version of the game in order to be modded (doing this removes the achievements, character booster, and cloud saves)</li></ul><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0"><b>Original Windows requirements (1998)</b></p><ul><li>Windows 95 with DirectX 5.1 installed;</li><li>Pentium 166 (without 3D accelerator card), Pentium 133 (with 3D accelerator card);</li><li>260MB Hard drive space (standard install), 460MB (maximum install);</li><li>32MB RAM;</li><li>100% DirectX 5.1 compatible SVGA video card;</li><li>100% Windows 95 compatible 4x CD-ROM drive;</li><li>100% DirectX 5.1 compatible sound card configured to playback digital and MIDI audio.</li></ul><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0"><b>Re-release Windows Requirements (2012)</b></p><ul><li>Microsoft Windows XP/Vista/7 (32/64-bit)</li><li>At least 2GHz CPU</li><li>At least 1GB RAM</li><li>DirectX 9-compatible GPU</li></ul><h2>iOS Release</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">An iOS port of Final Fantasy VII was released on August 20, 2015. It requires an iPhone 5S, iPad 3, or iPad Mini 2 running at least iOS 8.0 with 4GB of free space. Aside from control optimisation for touch devices, the iOS release also includes a maximum stats setting and the ability to disable all non-scripted combat encounters. Using these two features together allows players to experience the story without level grinding and frequent encounters.</p><h2>Remake</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Final Fantasy VII is a popular game in the series, and due to this rumours of a remake to the next generation consoles was imminent. In 2005 at the Sony E3 Press Conference, <a href="/square-enix/3010-104" data-ref-id="3010-104">Square-Enix</a> showed of a tech demo showing the opening intro sequence of the game on the PS3. Due to this a lot of buzz was being created around the subject, and individuals were getting excited at the notion of a remake.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Soon after Square-Enix made an official statement clearly stating that there are no plans for a remake to hit the stores any time soon. There has been even more speculation from the game <a href="/crisis-core-final-fantasy-vii/3030-2361" data-ref-id="3030-2361">Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII</a> that was released late 2007, which depicted the characters <a href="/zack-fair/3005-776" data-ref-id="3005-776">Zack</a> and <a href="/cloud-strife/3005-321" data-ref-id="3005-321">Cloud</a> in CG scenes towards the end of the game. To add to this, during the end credits it stated 'To be continued in FINAL FANTASY VII'.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The remake was confirmed at the 2015 Square-Enix E3 press conference. It's going to be released on Xbox One and PS4.</p><h2>Related Media</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Due to the popularity of the original Final Fantasy VII game released in 1997, Square Enix have released other forms of media based of the world the original game was set in, using the same characters and places as reference points. First of which is the movie Advent Children released in 2006, which was a CGI film based years after the events of the original game. Next was the game <a href="/dirge-of-cerberus-final-fantasy-vii/3030-5571" data-ref-id="3030-5571">Dirge of Cerberus</a> released in 2006 on the <a href="/playstation-2/3045-19" data-ref-id="3045-19">Playstation 2</a>, which describes the story of optional character <a href="/vincent-valentine/3005-788" data-ref-id="3005-788">Vincent Valentine</a>. It takes place before Advent Children and describes his relationship with Lucrecia Crescent (Sephiroth's mother) in detail. Next was the game Crisis Core released in 2007 for the Playstation Portable. It takes place before the original Final Fantasy VII, with the main protagonist being Zack Fair. Zack had a intimate reltaionship with Aerith Gainsborough and was best friends with Cloud. It shows the story of his struggle and also how Cloud ended up in Midgar for the start of Final Fantasy VII. Relating to the game Crisis Core, there also was a OVA (original video animation) of the stories of Zack and Cloud, and how they managed to end up in Midgar. It is a 25 minute video which basically shows the ending the Crisis Core in anime form. The ending for Crisis Core was different from the Last Order OVA which was released first.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>13053</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/1814630-box_ff7.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/1814630-box_ff7.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/1814630-box_ff7.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/1814630-box_ff7.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/1814630-box_ff7.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1814630-box_ff7.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/1814630-box_ff7.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Final

directed by <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/tim-schafer/3040-2860" data-ref-id="3040-2860">Tim Schafer</a> and released by <a href="/lucasarts/3010-644" data-ref-id="3010-644">LucasArts</a> in 1998. Players take the role of protagonist <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/manny-calavera/3005-689" data-ref-id="3005-689">Manny Calavera</a>, a travel agent for the Department of Death and <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/soul-reaper/3015-746" data-ref-id="3015-746">grim reaper</a>, as he travels through the <a href="/land-of-the-dead/3035-219" data-ref-id="3035-219">Land of the Dead</a> on a quest to reach the Ninth Underworld and his eternal rest. The game's story and setting primarily draw from aspects of Hispanic culture, Aztec mythology, and <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/film-noir/3015-1732" data-ref-id="3015-1732">film noir</a> cinema. Many of Grim's characters including Manny are voiced by Hispanic actors, and the game's script is peppered with Spanish words and phrases. Grim Fandango was the first LucasArts adventure game to feature 3D <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/polygonal-3d/3015-1430" data-ref-id="3015-1430">polygonal</a> characters moving and interacting in a <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/pre-rendered-backgrounds/3015-1804" data-ref-id="3015-1804">pre-rendered</a> 2D world.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">Grim Fandango moves away from the point-and-click interface of the <a href="/scumm/3015-429" data-ref-id="3015-429">SCUMM</a> engine used in preceding LucasArts adventure games and instead makes use of the <a href="/grime/3015-1084" data-ref-id="3015-1084">GrimE</a> engine that allows players to directly manipulate the movements of 3D characters using keyboard <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/tank-controls/3015-4647" data-ref-id="3015-4647">tank controls</a>. As Manny walks through the environment, his head will turn to look towards certain important objects or characters; players may examine, pick up or use the object Manny is looking at with the appropriate keyboard commands. Grim Fandango's minimal presentation was praised for its cinematic qualities, but was also criticized for being unwieldy compared to a more traditional point-and-click adventure game interface.</p><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/569/218317-bonewagon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-218317" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="640" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 640px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/569/218317-bonewagon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-218317"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/569/218317-bonewagon.jpg"></a></figure><p style="">Although the control scheme and game engine were new to the genre, Grim's core gameplay remains much the same as previous LucasArts adventure games and primarily alternates between navigating humorous <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/dialogue-trees/3015-77" data-ref-id="3015-77">dialogue trees</a> and completing <a href="/inventory/3015-513" data-ref-id="3015-513">inventory</a>-based puzzles in order to advance the plot. Players must explore their environment thoroughly to find key objects and may converse with <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/non-player-character/3015-967" data-ref-id="3015-967">NPC characters</a> or examine their surroundings for hints about the solution; these puzzles also demand varying levels of abstract reasoning. Grim Fandango is infamous for its difficulty even among other adventure games of the era, and some of the game's most challenging puzzles require players to not only observe, but also to listen carefully to character dialogue or even ambient noise in the environment in order to progress.</p><h2>Setting</h2><p style="">Grim Fandango's setting combines elements of Aztec mythology and Mexican folklore with a heavy dose of noir-style influence drawn from films such as Casablanca and The Big Sleep. The game takes place primarily in the Eighth Underworld of the Land of the Dead, a limbo that must be traversed by the souls of the deceased in order to reach their final reward in the Ninth Underworld and truly rest. Souls in the Land of the Dead take the form of skeletal Mexican calaca figures used during the Day of the Dead festival; naturally, this same festival is also celebrated within the Land of the Dead, during which time many souls visit loved ones in the Land of the Living. Several varieties of demons also inhabit this world, some of which co-exist with human souls and may be summoned for specific tasks such as maintenance or security. In areas of urban development, the bleak and lifeless landscape of the Eighth Underworld gives way to a 1930s-era film noir ambiance. Art deco and Aztec motifs are interwoven in many building facades and interiors, and the game's cast often dresses and behaves in typical noir fashion. Several characters also smoke heavily in keeping with the genre, which Grim's manual humorously references by addressing anti-smoking concerns with the fact that the game's characters are already dead.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="medium" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3318/317597-mural_restored.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-317597" data-ratio="0.32096584216726" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:32.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3318/317597-mural_restored.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-317597"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3318/317597-mural_restored.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3318/317597-mural_restored.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>A mural depicting the four-year journey of the soul through the Eighth Underworld</figcaption></figure><p style="">All souls begin their journey in <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/el-marrow/3035-333" data-ref-id="3035-333">El Marrow</a>, the largest city in the Eighth Underworld, for processing at the Department of Death. The souls of the dead are brought to the Eighth Underworld by "travel agents" working for the DOD who act as grim reapers, fetching recently-departed souls from the Land of the Living and setting them on their journey through the Land of the Dead. Souls who led poor lives must attempt a four-year journey on foot with little or no assistance, and they are often waylaid by terrible danger or lack of resources along a seemingly-endless path. Souls who led good lives may be offered a better choice of travel options, with the fastest mode of transport being the "Double-N" Number Nine Express: a luxury passenger train available only to the most virtuous souls that ferries them safely across the entirety of the Eighth Underworld in a mere four minutes.</p><p style="">Leaving the city of El Marrow by other means leads to the Petrified Forest, a maze of stone trees which are mined for a concrete-like substance used to construct El Marrow's skyscrapers. Souls fortunate enough to survive the forest's demonic denizens must cross a wide desert to reach the port town of <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/rubacava/3035-361" data-ref-id="3035-361">Rubacava</a>, where they may secure passage on a ship bound for Puerto Zapato on the opposite side of the Sea of Lament. The final stretch leads across vast icy wastes and snow-covered mountains, where an ancient <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/ninth-underworld-temple/3035-568" data-ref-id="3035-568">temple</a> serves as the portal to the Ninth Underworld.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3318/255851-grimfandangoss_28.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-255851" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3318/255851-grimfandangoss_28.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-255851"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3318/255851-grimfandangoss_28.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3318/255851-grimfandangoss_28.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Edge of the World, one of Grim Fandango's many surreal environments</figcaption></figure><p style="">Not all souls who make the long journey through the Eighth Underworld are guaranteed to reach their final destination, and many suffer a kind of "true death" along this treacherous path, such as dismemberment by any of the soul-hungry demons and monsters that roam the less-developed regions. Souls who led particularly despicable lives or who have made the journey through dishonest means may also be denied passage to the Ninth Underworld entirely, instead being cast into a fiery pit for all eternity. One of the most feared methods of true death is being "sprouted" by special Sproutella dart guns that create flowers which cover a soul's skeletal figure, causing immobilizing pain and eventually consuming the soul in the process. These weapons are popular among the strong elements of organized crime that have risen to claim power over other, weaker souls seeking salvation in the Land of the Dead.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1495/186238-gf_screen7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-186238" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1495/186238-gf_screen7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-186238"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1495/186238-gf_screen7.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1495/186238-gf_screen7.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Manuel "Manny" Calavera in his professional attire</figcaption></figure><p style=""><a href="/manny-calavera/3005-689" data-ref-id="3005-689">Manny Calavera</a> is a departed soul that has become disillusioned with his stagnant position in the bureaucracy of the afterlife. As a travel agent for the Department of Death, it is Manny's solemn duty to <a href="/soul-reaper/3015-746" data-ref-id="3015-746">reap</a> the souls of the recently-departed from the Land of the Living and usher them into the city of <a href="/el-marrow/3035-333" data-ref-id="3035-333">El Marrow</a> in the <a href="/land-of-the-dead/3035-219" data-ref-id="3035-219">Land of the Dead</a>, where they are judged for their deeds in life before being sent on their long journey to reach the Ninth Underworld. Manny himself is obligated to serve as an agent of the DOD until he has worked off an unspecified debt to the "powers that be" by selling enough Number Nine tickets to virtuous souls for their journey across the Land of the Dead. Once a top-rated salesman of travel packages, Manny has recently fallen into a slump due to a severe lack of clients who qualify for these premium "Double-N" tickets. After reaping the soul of yet another lackluster client, Manny realizes that his boss <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/don-copal/3005-1090" data-ref-id="3005-1090">Don Copal</a> assigns all the best clients to arrogant rival reaper <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/domino-hurley/3005-1835" data-ref-id="3005-1835">Domino Hurley</a>, thus making Manny's prospects of repaying his debt and reaching the Ninth Underworld extremely unlikely. Tired of waiting for a turnaround in his fortunes, Manny devises a scheme to steal one of Domino's clients and reclaim his former prestige as the DOD's premier reaper.</p><p style="">Although Manny successfully obtains an outstanding client, he is still unable to secure a Number Nine ticket for the saintly <a href="/mercedes-colomar/3005-779" data-ref-id="3005-779">Mercedes Colomar</a>. After reluctantly consigning Mercedes to a four-year journey on foot in spite of her spotless record, Manny begins to suspect that corruption has taken root inside the DOD. However, he is immediately accused by Copal of stealing Domino's client (among other recent infractions) and is quickly detained in the DOD's garage. An unexpected ally named <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/salvador-limones/3005-1104" data-ref-id="3005-1104">Salvador Limones</a> soon arrives at Manny's makeshift cell to release him, and he is eventually recruited as the newest (and only) field agent of the Lost Souls Alliance: a tiny resistance group dedicated to fighting corruption in the Eighth Underworld and restoring dignity to the souls cheated out of their rightful passage through the Land of the Dead. With the assistance of the LSA, Manny escapes El Marrow through a secret underground tunnel and embarks on a quest to find his lost "Meche". Emerging on the outskirts of the <a href="/petrified-forest/3035-359" data-ref-id="3035-359">Petrified Forest</a>, Manny soon encounters his demonic chauffeur <a href="/glottis/3005-847" data-ref-id="3005-847">Glottis</a>, who had recently been fired from the DOD for modifying company vehicles without permission. By working together, the pair manage to pass through the dangerous forest as well as the expansive desert beyond it, eventually reaching the sleepy port town of <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/rubacava/3035-361" data-ref-id="3035-361">Rubacava</a>.</p><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129563/2773196-rubacava.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2773196" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129563/2773196-rubacava.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2773196"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/129563/2773196-rubacava.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/129563/2773196-rubacava.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Rubacava's cat-racing track at Feline Meadows</figcaption></figure><p style="">Grim Fandango's story takes place over four years; each chapter occurs during the Day of the Dead festival with a year-long break between acts, allowing for a significant amount of off-screen character development. Manny typically ends each chapter as he begins a new entry-level job position required to continue his search for Mercedes. Their first-year anniversary after leaving El Marrow finds Manny and Glottis as successful co-owners of the new Calavera Café, a thriving nightclub and casino in Rubacava. When Mercedes finally arrives at his club one night, Manny abandons everything he had built in the past year to pursue her. However, she is quickly dragged away onto the departing SS Lambada by Domino, who has risen to a position of power in the DOD since Don Copal's brutal murder a year ago by co-conspirator <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/hector-lemans/3005-1097" data-ref-id="3005-1097">Hector LeMans</a>. After being prevented from boarding Domino's ship by Mercedes herself, Manny concocts a plan that same night to book passage for both Glottis and himself as crewmen aboard <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/velasco/3005-5876" data-ref-id="3005-5876">Velasco's</a> cargo ship, the SS Limbo.</p><p style="">Another year passes, and Manny's passion for success has allowed him to rise to the rank of captain aboard the newly-rechristened and re-chromed SS <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/lola/3005-5894" data-ref-id="3005-5894">Lola</a>. After making port at Puerto Zapato on the Day of the Dead, Manny receives word from Salvador's carrier pigeons that corrupt DOD agents have been dispatched with orders to assassinate Manny and his entire crew. He also learns that after being abducted by Domino, Mercedes threw herself overboard somewhere near "The Pearl," a legendary treasure resting at the bottom of the Sea of Lament that shines brightly enough to lure many greedy souls to a watery doom. Making a narrow escape in the severed stern section of his ship, Manny and Glottis arrive near the Pearl's location just before the remainder of the SS Lola sinks to the bottom of the ocean. With the assistance of a longtime seafloor wanderer named <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/chepito/3005-31266" data-ref-id="3005-31266">Chepito</a>, the pair carve a path through the murky depths and eventually arrive at a coral-mining facility at the <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/edge-of-the-world/3035-567" data-ref-id="3035-567">Edge of the World</a>, where Mercedes and several other lost souls are being held by Domino against their will. Manny sabotages the mining plant, raising the wreck of Velasco's long-lost ship SS Lamancha from the seafloor and rescuing Mercedes in the process; however, his new ship is quickly pursued by Domino, and a showdown ensues between the two reapers which ultimately results in Domino's grisly demise.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129563/2773197-temple.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2773197" data-ratio="0.6875" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:68.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129563/2773197-temple.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2773197"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/129563/2773197-temple.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/129563/2773197-temple.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ninth Underworld Temple</figcaption></figure><p style="">At long last, after reaching Puerto Zapato again and trekking across vast frozen tundra, Manny's group finally reaches the <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/ninth-underworld-temple/3035-568" data-ref-id="3035-568">Ninth Underworld Temple</a> another year later, where Glottis suddenly falls critically ill due to his recent lack of exposure to motorized vehicles. While Manny and Mercedes investigate Glottis' condition, the rest of their group is detained by the Ninth Underworld's gatekeeper; he states that these souls were issued Double-N tickets upon arrival in the Land of the Dead which must be redeemed to pass through. The punishment for selling Double-N tickets is severe, and unless Manny can produce his group's assigned tickets, their souls will be damned for eternity.</p><p style="">Utilizing a makeshift rocket-propelled gondola, Manny, Mercedes and a revitalized Glottis ride the Number Nine's rails all the way back to Rubacava. The trio recovers the Bonewagon that had been stored there so that they may slip into "Nuevo Marrow": the renamed city of El Marrow that has since become a den of vice and corruption under Hector's control. Accompanied by the ultra-hip <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/olivia-ofrenda/3005-1758" data-ref-id="3005-1758">Olivia Ofrenda</a>, a self-professed admirer of Salvador and his noble cause, the group arrives at LSA headquarters underneath Nuevo Marrow shortly thereafter. Olivia, Salvador and Meche split off to conduct vital reconnaissance of Hector LeMans' casino inside the former DOD building while Manny and Glottis investigate the sewers beneath the city and discover the floral boutique of Bowsley, Hector's paranoid supplier of Sproutella weaponry. Arming himself with deadly baby's breath, a disguised Manny infiltrates Hector's casino and eventually reaches Hector LeMans himself. After gaining Hector's trust, Hector leads Manny back to his old office and unwittingly offers him his former position at the DOD just before Manny reveals himself and demands the stolen tickets at gunpoint. Hector narrowly escapes by falling from the roof of the casino after losing his precious stash of Double-N tickets.</p><p style="">Manny meets Mercedes at Nuevo Marrow's train station to entrust her with the stolen tickets, but the pair are ambushed by Hector's men and forced to split up. Manny escapes into Olivia's waiting car with the tickets; however, he is betrayed by Olivia, who reveals herself to be Hector's lover after tossing Salvador's battered and disembodied skull into Manny's lap. Olivia drives Manny to the outskirts of town to dispose of him at Hector's greenhouse, where he is shot with slow-acting Sproutella by a gloating Hector. Manny manages to escape from the greenhouse in great pain before collapsing in Hector's hillside garden, using the last of his strength to freeze the floral growth in his rib cage with liquid nitrogen before it can spread. He returns to Olivia's car and is given his final orders by Salvador's head: secure the Sproutella gun in the car's trunk and look after the rest of the LSA. Olivia quickly discovers Manny loitering near her car and picks up Salvador's skull, who bites down on his hidden Sproutella-filled fake tooth, sprouting both himself and Olivia.</p><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129563/2810134-gfending.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2810134" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="640" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 640px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129563/2810134-gfending.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2810134"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/12/129563/2810134-gfending.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/12/129563/2810134-gfending.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Recovering the key to the trunk from Salvador's body, Manny returns to the greenhouse for a final showdown with Hector; however, Hector is very well-armed and the situation soon becomes a stalemate.

Manny returns to the temple with Mercedes, Glottis and the stolen tickets, where he explains Hector's scheme to the gatekeeper and secures his friends' release. He also bids a tearful farewell to Glottis; as a spirit of the land, Glottis cannot pass into the Ninth Underworld. After saying their goodbyes, Manny, Meche and the other lost souls finally board the Number Nine on an express trip to their rightful hereafters.</p><h2>Legacy</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1371/190604-grimfandango106.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-190604" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1371/190604-grimfandango106.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-190604"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1371/190604-grimfandango106.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1371/190604-grimfandango106.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Grim Fandango cast</figcaption></figure><p style="">While critically acclaimed, Grim Fandango was not a commercial success; however, it did spawn a large fan base attracted by its humor and bizarre aesthetic.

The five levels resemble New York (USA), Paris (France), Neuschwanstein (Germany), Egyptian temples and a lakeside area.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">As each stage is traversed, the road behind the car turns white as it is painted, to show where the player has driven. Several obstacles attempt to stop the player's car such as police cars, cats and spike strips. Once all blocks in a level have been painted, the player moves on to the next stage. Random red balloons will appear, if the player grabs three in the same level, it will warp them ahead a few levels and provide bonus points. Even if the player ends up back in New York, the difficulty will stay the same as the previous level warped from.</p><h2>Music</h2><p style="">Each level has its own musical track, although they all resemble "Allegro non troppo e molto maestoso" from Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No.1.</p><h2>Roots</h2><p style="">City Connection's general gameplay is similar to <a href="/miner-2049er/3030-14533" data-ref-id="3030-14533">Miner 2049er</a> which was released on several platforms including the <a href="/apple-ii/3045-12" data-ref-id="3045-12">Apple II</a>, <a href="/atari-2600/3045-40" data-ref-id="3045-40">Atari 2600</a> and <a href="/atari-5200/3045-67" data-ref-id="3045-67">5200</a>, <a href="/commodore-64/3045-14" data-ref-id="3045-14">Commodore 64</a> and <a href="/colecovision/3045-47" data-ref-id="3045-47">ColecoVision</a>.

Though similar to Gradius, Life Force does have some unique modifications to differentiate it from its more well-known predecessor.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Known by its original Japanese name Salamander, the game first hit Arcades in 1986. Though Salamander did not take place entirely within an alien organism, this idea was expanded upon for its US release and given a more biological name to suit the change - Life Force.</p><p style="">This new organic version was re-released in Japanese Arcades with the changed name, as well as adopting Gradius' old power-up system and some additional sprite work.</p><p style="">Salamander's first home port would be the MSX version in 1987, which received a new story and an entirely new animated introduction sequence. The game would later see a NES version, also with reworked stages (including a skeletal vertical-scrolling stage and an Egyptian-themed stage) and the old Gradius power-up system as well as versions for many other popular home computers and consoles of the period.</p><p style="">In 2008 (Japan)/2009 (US) the NES version would be re-released for the Wii's Virtual Console.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">Salamander is a spiritual sequel to <a href="/gradius/3030-15508" data-ref-id="3030-15508">Gradius</a>, <a href="/konami-corporation/3010-87" data-ref-id="3010-87">Konami</a>'s earlier shooter, and shares many deliberate similarities with its predecessor. The player flies the customizable spaceship <a href="/vic-viper/3055-71" data-ref-id="3055-71">Vic Viper</a> through a series of horizontally scrolling levels, destroying enemies and collecting power-ups to assist them. Unlike Gradius, which had the player stack up tokens to unlock power-ups of their choosing, the ones found in Salamander are random. However the old Gradius system would reappear in many versions of Salamander, including the NES home version.</p><p style="">There exists the possibility of a second player. Instead of the blue Vic Viper, the second player pilots the red Lord British, based on the Vic Viper design.</p><p style="">It was noted at the time for its simulated speech samples and graphical quality, especially with some of the stage animations. Particularly memorable is one stage set in the midst of a raging inferno that would occasionally send arcs of flame flying across the screen.</p><h3>Power-Ups</h3><p style="">Attentive players can find one of three types of power-up item while playing: These include the red power-ups, found after destroying an enemy wave or a gold-tinted enemy, which the player can spend towards power-ups provided they have the right amount. The player can also run across blue power-ups, which work as instantaneous smart bombs that clear the screen of enemies, and the rare flashing power-ups that grant an extra ship.</p><ul><li><strong>Speed Up:</strong> The cheapest power-up, Speed Up makes the ship faster, allowing for more maneuverability.</li><li><strong>Missile:</strong> This power-up allows the player's ship (and any Options they might have) to launch two missiles from the top/bottom of the ship (or left/right in vertical stages) which coast along walls until they either hit something or leave the screen. The player can select the missile power-up again to increase their speed.</li><li><strong>Ripple:</strong> A weapon that fires rings of energy at enemies. The rings expand the further they get away from the ship, making them useful for hitting multiple targets accurately.</li><li><strong>Laser:</strong> A concentrated laser beam of considerable power. Selecting Laser again makes it wider and slower. The beam will actually travel with the ship's movements, allowing the player to sweep the screen with it. Can't be used simultaneously with the Ripple beam: Activating one deactivates the other.</li><li><strong>Option:</strong> An Option is an additional weapon platform that follows the main ship. It is able to fire all the weapons the main ship can, essentially doubling the player's firepower. In the US version, up to two Options can be obtained, though this number increases to three for the Japanese version. A side-effect is that enemy units become stronger to compensate for this added power.</li></ul>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>13960</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/9/93770/2361964-nes_lifeforce.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93770/2361964-nes_lifeforce.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/9/93770/2361964-nes_lifeforce.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/9/93770/2361964-nes_lifeforce.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/9/93770/2361964-nes_lifeforce.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2361964-nes_lifeforce.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/9/93770/2361964-nes_lifeforce.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Life

Eleven of these use either Han, Chewbacca, or Luke, unlocking each character as the plot progress.

The game predates <a href="/gradius/3030-15508" data-ref-id="3030-15508">Gradius</a>, and shares many qualities with that classic franchise.</p><p style="">Scramble is a <a title="Side-scrolling video game" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-scrolling_video_game" rel="nofollow">side-scrolling</a> shooter with forced scrolling. It was the first scrolling shooter to offer multiple, distinct <a title="Level (video gaming)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_(video_gaming)" rel="nofollow">levels</a>. The game is thus credited with setting the template for most of the side-scrolling shooters that followed its release.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/537343-scramble_3.png" data-ref-id="1300-537343" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="1.1425" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:114.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/537343-scramble_3.png" data-ref-id="1300-537343"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8273/537343-scramble_3.png"></a><figcaption>Scramble's second stage</figcaption></figure><p style="">Scramble is a horizontal shooter played using a four-way joystick and two buttons that control the forward guns and bombs. The game has six stages, and in each stage the player must navigate a gauntlet of enemies. The environment is also a considerable hazard as the terrain can be difficult to navigate with the slow ship. Additionally, the ship is constantly running out of fuel, and must refuel on the fly by destroying fuel tanks that litter the stages. The final stage requires the player to finish a tricky bombing run, which if they fail, they must repeat the stage. After finishing the last level, the game loops back to the first stage and plays again at a higher difficulty level where the ship runs out of fuel more quickly.</p><h2>Legacy</h2><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/26740/1084985-scramble_arcade_flyer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1084985" data-size="small" style="width: 227px" data-ratio="1.3215859030837" data-width="227" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:132.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/26740/1084985-scramble_arcade_flyer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1084985"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/26740/1084985-scramble_arcade_flyer.jpg"></a><figcaption>Arcade flyer</figcaption></figure><p style="">Scramble was ported to many different home game systems and computers, both legally and as illegal clones. It was the subject of an important intellectual property case (Stern Electronics, Inc. v. Kaufman, 669 F.2d 852) where it was ruled that <a href="/stern-electronics-inc/3010-2694" data-ref-id="3010-2694">Stern Electronics Inc</a>. (the game's publisher in North America) could copyright the images and sounds in a game and not just the game's source code.</p><h3>Sequels and Relation To Gradius</h3><p style="">The arcade game <a href="/super-cobra/3030-10519" data-ref-id="3030-10519">Super Cobra </a>could be called a sequel to Scramble, as it shares basically the same game mechanic as the original. Scramble is also cited as a predecessor to Gradius in both the introduction to <a href="/gradius-galaxies/3030-2030" data-ref-id="3030-2030">Gradius Galaxies</a> on the <a href="/game-boy-advance/3045-4" data-ref-id="3045-4">Game Boy Advance </a>and the Gradius Breakdown bonus DVD included with <a href="/gradius-v/3030-10201" data-ref-id="3030-10201">Gradius V</a>; however, Konami disputed the relation in their guide for the Gradius Portable collection on <a href="/psp/3045-18" data-ref-id="3045-18">PSP</a>. Although Scramble may now not be part of the official Gradius continuum, it's easy to see how some of the features of Scramble, such as independently-fired weapons and hazardous terrain, were further developed for Gradius.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>14662</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/0/26/2761955-44136302.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/2761955-44136302.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/0/26/2761955-44136302.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/26/2761955-44136302.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/26/2761955-44136302.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/26/2761955-44136302.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/0/26/2761955-44136302.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Scramble]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-6/]]></api_detail_url><id>6</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: E]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>1981-02-28 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-4/]]></api_detail_url><id>4</id><name><![CDATA[Game Boy Advance]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/game-boy-advance/3045-4/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[GBA]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-14/]]></api_detail_url><id>14</id><name><![CDATA[Commodore 64]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/commodore-64/3045-14/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[C64]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-76/]]></api_detail_url><id>76</id><name><![CDATA[Vectrex]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/vectrex/3045-76/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[VECT]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-84/]]></api_detail_url><id>84</id><name><![CDATA[Arcade]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/arcade/3045-84/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[ARC]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-86/]]></api_detail_url><id>86</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360 Games Store]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360-games-store/3045-86/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[XBGS]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/]]></api_detail_url><id>146</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 4]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS4]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/scramble/3030-14662/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-15334/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-04-01 16:20:22</date_added><date_last_updated>2015-05-21 16:31:20</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[Go for it!

Players control a ship called the <a href="/vic-viper/3055-71" data-ref-id="3055-71">Vic Viper</a> through multiple space stages. The enemies encountered include a large array of alien ships and creatures which try to collide into the Vic Viper or shoot it down. Luckily, throughout each stage <a href="/power-up/3015-700" data-ref-id="3015-700">power-ups</a> are collected by shooting down certain color enemies. Power-ups are saved up on a power meter on the bottom of the player's screen. Once a player reaches the power-up cell that they wish to buy, it can be obtained by pressing the select button (<a href="/nes/3045-21" data-ref-id="3045-21">NES</a> release). The power-up cells include:</p><ul><li><b>Speed Up</b>: Increases the movement speed of the Vic Viper.</li><li><a href="/missile/3055-74" data-ref-id="3055-74"> <b>Missile</b></a>: Drops missiles to kill ground targets with every shot.</li><li><b>Double</b>: Shoots two cannon shots at once rather than one shot.</li><li><b>Laser</b>: Replaces the standard cannon shot with a laser beam.</li><li><b>Option</b>: Creates a hovering orange ball that follows the Vic Viper doubling its firepower with each Option.</li><li><b>?</b>: Provides a <a href="/shield/3055-87" data-ref-id="3055-87"> shield</a> on the front of the ship.</li></ul><p style="">At the end of each stage a boss battle takes place where, more often than not, the Vic Viper must shoot at its core to destroy it.

Developed by Namco and published by Namco and Midway.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Released in 1981, Galaga has become one of the most popular arcade games of all time. Much more well received than its predecessor, <a href="/galaxian/3030-2445" data-ref-id="3030-2445">Galaxian</a>, Galaga features fast paced <a href="/top-down-perspective/3015-788" data-ref-id="3015-788">top-down</a> shooting action. The player takes control of a small ship located at the bottom of the screen and is tasked with destroying the incoming waves of insect-like enemies.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/13/139866/2697342-1031-155633.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2697342" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="1.2857142857143" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:128.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/13/139866/2697342-1031-155633.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2697342"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/139866/2697342-1031-155633.jpg"></a><figcaption>Tractor-beam</figcaption></figure><p style="">The player controls a "fighter" spaceship whose movement is restricted to flying left or right. Upon the start of a level, waves of enemies fly in formation and complete a flight pattern before positioning themselves at the top of the screen. It is ideal to destroy the incoming ships before they complete their fly-in. Once in formation at the top of the screen, enemies will regularly break off to attack. Enemy ships attack by dropping bombs and/or attempting to collide with the player's ship.</p><p style="">The most popular and effective strategy is for the player to sacrifice their own ship to a "Boss Galaga" ship. These ships hover above the player and emit a tractor-beam. Entering this beam will sacrifice the current ship and allow the player to use one of the reserves. Destroying the "Boss Galaga" will reclaim the captured ship. The player is then rewarded with dual ships which effectively doubles the player's firepower.</p><p style="">Additionally, a bonus stage occurs every four levels, allowing the player to earn extra points without the risk of being destroyed. Upon destroying every fighter during a bonus stage, the player will then be rewarded with an extra life.</p><h2>Galaga in Mass Media</h2><ul><li>1982 - Actor <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000111/" rel="nofollow">Matthew Broderick</a> spent two months playing Galaga to prepare for his upcoming role in Wargames.</li><li>2004 - The ABC television series Lost names a <a href="http://lostpedia.wikia.com/wiki/Galaga" rel="nofollow">DHARMA Initiative submarine</a> after the popular video game.</li><li>2009 - Fans are able to purchase a Galaga arcade-style video game Christmas ornament (complete with audibles) thanks to Hallmark.</li><li>2012 - In Marvel's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Avengers_%282012_film%29" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">The Avengers</a>, <a href="/iron-man/3005-1370" data-ref-id="3005-1370">Tony Stark</a> catches a <a href="/shield/3015-2363" data-ref-id="3015-2363">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a> agent playing Galaga.

PlayStation Network with upgraded graphics and motion control.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">flOw started out as a free <a href="http://intihuatani.usc.edu/cloud/flowing/" rel="nofollow">flash game</a> available online in which the player takes control of an aquatic, worm-like creature, which is controlled via the mouse. The basic mechanic of the game is to 'eat' other organisms that inhabit the environment, which causes the player's creature to grow or evolve. The creatures also have special abilities controlled by the left mouse button.</p><p style="">The <a data-ref-id="3045-35" href="/playstation-3/3045-35">PlayStation 3</a> version of flOw is largely the same as the flash version, but it expands the scope of the gameplay by offering more playable creatures and <a data-ref-id="3000-9" href="/sixaxis-controller/3000-9">SIXAXIS</a> motion control.</p><p style="">On October 10, 2009, a <a data-ref-id="3015-198" href="/playstation-trophies/3015-198">trophy</a> patch was implemented.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">flOw is a game in which uses the sixaxis function of the <a data-ref-id="3000-29" href="/dualshock-3/3000-29">DualShock 3</a> controller. You control these cellular lifeforms and eat other cells floating around the screen to make your creature grow. Throughout the game, you will take part in six different campaigns, and use your creature to go through portals to advance through different layers in the campaign. You can go through the campaign with or without eating any other cells, which will make your creature remain the same size and be more vulnerable. Also eating creatures or cells will help your creature grow, but either creatures bigger than you can also eat cells growing off your creature. The basic goal is to get to the end of the campaign with all of the creatures, and eventually getting to the credits screen, thus beating the game of flOw.</p><h2>Structure (Flash/PC version)</h2><p style="">The PC version features two playable creatures, these creatures, the 'snake' and the 'jellyfish' are also the first two playable creatures in the PS3 version (see below).</p><h2>Structure (PS3 version)</h2><p style="">flOw is loosely based around the idea of levels, but the implementation is quite far from the norm. The player can move 'up' or 'down,' in terms of depth, by eating special blue or red organisms respectively. At each level of depth, there are different organisms, some of which can be hostile. Engaging hostile creatures is never explicitly mandatory for progressing to the next level, but survival at the deeper, more difficult levels, is greatly aided by having previously advanced your creature by eating enough organisms to make it evolve.</p><h2>Playable Creatures</h2><p style="">There are 5 playable creatures in the main version of flOw, and an extra playable creature in the add-on pack.</p><h3>First Creature - 'Snake'</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/101967-snake3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-101967" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-ratio="0" data-width="0" data-embed-type="image"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/101967-snake3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-101967"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/101967-snake3.jpg"></a><figcaption>The first creature in flOw</figcaption></figure><p style="">The first playable creature is snake like in appearance, growing longer as it consume more organisms. Its unique ability is a speed boost. It can increase its length, and can also develop wing-like appendages on its sides by eating certain organisms.</p><h3>Second Creature - 'Jellyfish'</h3><p style="">The second playable creature is round and jellyfish like. Its normal movement is fairly slow, but its special ability, a spinning maneuver that sucks in nearby organisms, allows it to build up momentum. After using its special ability, it is able to briefly move faster.</p><h3>Third Creature - 'Dolphin'</h3><p style="">The third playable creature has a body which loosely resembles the shape of a dolphin, but gains a long tail similar to the snake creature as it develops.</p><h3>Fourth Creature - 'Stealth Snake'</h3><p style="">The fourth playable creature is similar to the firs. However, its special ability is to cloak itself, and to paralyze other organisms.</p><h3>Fifth Creature - 'Predator Snake'</h3><p style="">The fifth playable creature is another snake like one. This one, however, it develops more aggressive looking body parts, and has the special ability to lock on other organisms and to make a sharp dash towards it, making it very easy to attack other creatures.</p><h3>Sixth Creature - 'Credit Snake'</h3><p style="">The sixth playable creature is yet another snake. This is the simplest of the six, as it simply grows longer with each bit of food it eats, and only has a small boost ability. The only time this creature is playable is during the credits of the game, in which the player consumes a piece of food attached to each credit.</p><h3>Seventh Creature - 'Bubble Boy'</h3><p style="">The seventh playable creature was added in expansion pack released for the game. This creature has the appearance of a small blob surrounded by several sections of hard shell each attached to the body of the creature by tendrils. The creature's special ability is to draw this portions of its body inward, creating a shell, granting the player temporary invulnerability.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>15849</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/0/2748/217994-flow.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2748/217994-flow.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/0/2748/217994-flow.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2748/217994-flow.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/2748/217994-flow.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/2748/217994-flow.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/0/2748/217994-flow.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[flOw]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>7</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-6/]]></api_detail_url><id>6</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: E]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-7/]]></api_detail_url><id>7</id><name><![CDATA[PEGI: 3+]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2006-04-14 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-17/]]></api_detail_url><id>17</id><name><![CDATA[Mac]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/mac/3045-17/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[MAC]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-88/]]></api_detail_url><id>88</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation Network (PS3)]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-network-ps3/3045-88/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3N]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-116/]]></api_detail_url><id>116</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation Network (PSP)]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-network-psp/3045-116/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PSPN]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-140/]]></api_detail_url><id>140</id><name><![CDATA[Browser]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/browser/3045-140/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[BROW]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-143/]]></api_detail_url><id>143</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation Network (Vita)]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-network-vita/3045-143/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PSNV]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/]]></api_detail_url><id>146</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 4]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS4]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/flow/3030-15849/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[Another World

Because Lester cannot survive most direct enemy attacks (though the game's laser-wielding aliens will often miss Lester), precision and care are recommended when engaging armed foes. It is even possible for Lester to deplete his laser pistol's energy, requiring players to seek out a recharge station to restore the gun's functionality.</p><p style="">The game includes a password system, allowing players to continue their game from a<a href="/checkpoints/3015-292" data-ref-id="3015-292"> checkpoint</a>. There are several areas where the player must solve complex <a href="/puzzles/3015-932" data-ref-id="3015-932"> puzzles</a> in order to proceed, often involving trial-and-error.</p><h2>Setting</h2><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5052/407523-another_world20.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-407523" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5052/407523-another_world20.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-407523"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5052/407523-another_world20.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5052/407523-another_world20.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>An alien city that serves as the game's primary setting</figcaption></figure><p style="">Because there are no explanatory <a href="/cutscene/3015-22" data-ref-id="3015-22"> cutscenes</a> or dialogue in Out of This World, the game's alien setting and its history are entirely left up to the player to infer from their immediate surroundings. From the outset, the region of the world where the game takes place seems to be arid and largely desolate, and the native flora and fauna encountered by Lester is uniformly brutal and predatory. The planet's sentient life forms appear to condone forced labor and <a href="/gladiators/3015-3247" data-ref-id="3015-3247">gladiatorial</a> events, as evidenced by the prison mining complex and coliseum areas; these institutions suggest a culture similar to that of the ancient <a href="/roman-empire/3015-7127" data-ref-id="3015-7127">Roman Empire</a>. The city's buildings could also be compared to traditional <a href="/middle-east/3035-1904" data-ref-id="3035-1904">middle-eastern</a> structures.</p><p style="">Though their culture may seem primitive by human standards, the aliens' technology is far more advanced in some key areas. They seem to possess a greater understanding of energy and how to harness it, evident in the "power nodes" dotted around the city that can instantly recharge Lester's gun. The aliens' laser-based weaponry also takes advantage of their energy mastery, which can <a href="/stun/3015-1577" data-ref-id="3015-1577"> stun</a> on the lowest setting or instantly incinerate organic targets, leaving only a charred skeleton behind.</p><h2>Development</h2><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/913/953794-rotoscoping.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-953794" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75070821529745" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/913/953794-rotoscoping.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-953794"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/913/953794-rotoscoping.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/913/953794-rotoscoping.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Rotoscoping models for Lester's gun and sports car used during development</figcaption></figure><p style="">Animation of the principle characters was performed through a process called <a href="/rotoscoping/3015-1249" data-ref-id="3015-1249"> rotoscoping</a>, whereby real objects were used as models for animation work, lending a life-like and quirky feel to the movement that might seem flat and predictable if animated through simple physics models. Lester's appearance is supposedly based on <a href="/eric-chahi/3040-10966" data-ref-id="3040-10966"> Eric Chahi</a>, the game's designer. However, because Chahi found it disturbing to view himself as a character in the game, he decided to alter Lester's appearance and depicted him as a redhead instead.</p><p style="">Out of This World was originally released for <a href="/pc/3045-94" data-ref-id="3045-94"> PC</a>, <a href="/amiga/3045-1" data-ref-id="3045-1"> Amiga</a>, <a href="/atari-st/3045-13" data-ref-id="3045-13"> Atari</a>, <a href="/mac/3045-17" data-ref-id="3045-17"> Macintosh</a>, <a href="/3do/3045-26" data-ref-id="3045-26"> 3DO</a>, <a href="/snes/3045-9" data-ref-id="3045-9"> SNES</a>, <a href="/genesis/3045-6" data-ref-id="3045-6"> Genesis</a> and the <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/sega-cd/3045-29" data-ref-id="3045-29">Sega CD</a>. The Atari and Amiga versions were developed first. They are relatively shorter compared to later versions, and have a higher <a href="/difficulty-level/3015-183" data-ref-id="3015-183"> difficulty level</a> due to more precise timing required of the player. The PC version was the first to introduce a whole new level in the middle to latter third of the game to help lengthen the game and strengthen the narrative.</p><p style="">Further obstacles were added for the Genesis and SNES console ports, as <a href="/interplay-entertainment-corp/3010-580" data-ref-id="3010-580"> Interplay</a> purportedly wanted players to get as much gameplay as possible for their dollar. <a href="/nintendo/3010-90" data-ref-id="3010-90"> Nintendo</a> also had demands about certain scenes which were considered to be inappropriate for minors (which amounted to a few pixels worth of deletions during a bathhouse scene; as well as changing reddish ichor, which might be interpreted as blood, to green).</p><p style="">The Sega CD version of the game included a game set in the same world, dubbed <a href="/heart-of-the-alien-out-of-this-world-parts-i-and-ii/3030-17785" data-ref-id="3030-17785"> Out of this World 2: Heart of the Alien</a>, which took place from the point of view of the aliens. Eric Chahi has stated, however, that this in-house Interplay project suffers in terms of animation quality and its value as a game, as he was not involved in the project.</p><p style="">Eric Chahi has stated that the problem with some of the early enhanced versions was that the backgrounds were a lot easier to improve than the characters themselves. In order to enhance the characters, new rotoscoping or detailed, frame-by-frame enhancement of the animations would have to be done, while the backdrops could be repainted with relative ease. Doing the latter without the former, though, would result in the characters in the foreground looking flat. For the 3DO version, Chahi says, this is especially apparent.</p><p style="">The enhancement of the animations themselves could probably not be done because processors of the time could not handle so many frames of animation being very detailed, although currently such restrictions are negligible.</p><p style="">In addition to the listed versions, there were also unofficial ports to both the <a href="/game-boy-advance/3045-4" data-ref-id="3045-4"> GBA</a> and <a href="/gamepark-32/3045-133" data-ref-id="3045-133">GamePark 32</a> systems.</p><h2>Sequel</h2><p style="">Despite potential interest in a sequel, Chahi himself has stated that he would prefer the story of Out of This World to have no official continuation. He maintains that preserving the ambiguous ending is important to reinforce the game's sense of mystery:</p><blockquote><p style="">"I think the story is complete. It has a lot of mystery, so doing a sequel would be very tricky. It could break the magic it has."</p><cite>Eric Chahi interview from Retro Gamer issue# 96, 2011</cite></blockquote><p style="">A sequel to Out of this World was developed for the <a href="/sega-cd/3045-29" data-ref-id="3045-29">Sega CD</a> in 1994 called <a href="/heart-of-the-alien-out-of-this-world-parts-i-and-ii/3030-17785" data-ref-id="3030-17785"> Heart of the Alien</a>, which starred Buddy as the main protagonist instead of Lester. However, Chahi was not involved with this sequel's development and has dismissed the events of Heart of the Alien as non-canonical in the context of the original game's story.</p><h2>Re-releases &amp; Remakes</h2><p style="">A higher-resolution version of Out of This World is available from creator Eric Chahi on <a href="http://www.anotherworld.fr/anotherworld_uk/index.htm" rel="nofollow"> his website.</a> This version has more detailed backgrounds, multiple graphics modes, additional save points and features compatibility with Windows XP and Vista.</p><p style="">Telco Games also distributes a mobile phone version of the game.</p><h3>15th Anniversary Edition</h3><p style="">The 15th Anniversary Edition is also available from GOG.com and comes with a selection of extra content, including:</p><ul><li>Manual (17 pages)</li><li>2 HD wallpapers</li><li>Development diary</li><li>Technical handbook</li><li>Soundtrack</li><li>"Making Of" video</li></ul><h3>20th Anniversary Edition</h3><p style="">In 2011, in commemoration of its 20th anniversary, Out of This World was made available for the iOS (iPhone and iPad) and later Android.

It uses a system of a fixed location where the player has to fend off waves of opponents until their numbers dwindle, and the stage boss appears to intervene. Two sequels to Renegade were made: <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/target-renegade/3030-9769" data-ref-id="3030-9769">Target: Renegade</a> and <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/renegade-iii-the-final-chapter/3030-9994" data-ref-id="3030-9994">Renegade 3: The Final Chapter</a>. Neither of the sequels were developed by <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/technos-japan-corp/3010-452" data-ref-id="3010-452">Technos</a>.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Renegade (as an arcade game) is notable for being a western localization of Nekketsu Kōha <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/kunio-kun/3025-858" data-ref-id="3025-858">Kunio-kun</a>. The notability is that the sprite and stage changes are heavily influenced by the 1979 film '<a href="//www.giantbomb.com/the-warriors/3025-2124" data-ref-id="3025-2124">The Warriors</a>'. No lawsuit was ever made against the game for such similarities.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Renegade uses various combat techniques that were progressive for beat-em ups of its era. These included reverse attacks (attacking an opponent behind the player), grab attacks and the ability to 'mount' and attack downed enemies. It could be argued that even much later games in the style, such as <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/final-fight/3025-195" data-ref-id="3025-195">Final Fight</a>, were influenced by Renegade.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>18293</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/7/73970/1254080-renegade_amiga_front.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/73970/1254080-renegade_amiga_front.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/7/73970/1254080-renegade_amiga_front.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/7/73970/1254080-renegade_amiga_front.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/7/73970/1254080-renegade_amiga_front.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/7/73970/1254080-renegade_amiga_front.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/7/73970/1254080-renegade_amiga_front.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Renegade]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-6/]]></api_detail_url><id>6</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB:

The game switches from an isometric view while on the surface to a more standard side-scrolling view whenever MagMax travels underground.</p><p style="">When MagMax finds a piece of its robot form, the piece joins onto the ship and provides the player with additional firepower. It will also take a hit and be destroyed in place of the player's ship, providing a secondary use as a free hit. Should the player find all the pieces, the MagMax's robotic form is quite formidable in combat and can even change its main weapon between a laser drill, fireballs and other powerful weapons.</p><p style="">The game was Nihon Bussan's first NES title. Nihon Bussan was, at the time, a minor player in the Arcade market, producing games like <a href="/terra-cresta/3030-1272" data-ref-id="3030-1272">Terra Cresta</a>. They would continue producing NES titles for much of the system's lifespan.</p><p style="">In April 2015, the Arcade version of MagMax was released on Japanese PSN by <a href="/hamster-corporation/3010-4703" data-ref-id="3010-4703">Hamster</a>, joining their <a href="/arcade-archives/3025-3081" data-ref-id="3025-3081">Arcade Archives</a> collection.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>18881</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/9/93770/2362024-nes_magmax.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93770/2362024-nes_magmax.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/9/93770/2362024-nes_magmax.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/9/93770/2362024-nes_magmax.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/9/93770/2362024-nes_magmax.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2362024-nes_magmax.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/9/93770/2362024-nes_magmax.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[MagMax]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating/><original_release_date>1986-03-18 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-11/]]></api_detail_url><id>11</id><name><![CDATA[Amstrad CPC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/amstrad-cpc/3045-11/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[CPC]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-16/]]></api_detail_url><id>16</id><name><![CDATA[ZX Spectrum]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/zx-spectrum/3045-16/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[SPEC]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-21/]]></api_detail_url><id>21</id><name><![CDATA[Nintendo Entertainment System]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-21/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[NES]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-84/]]></api_detail_url><id>84</id><name><![CDATA[Arcade]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/arcade/3045-84/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[ARC]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/]]></api_detail_url><id>146</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 4]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS4]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/magmax/3030-18881/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-19651/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-04-01 16:48:50</date_added><date_last_updated>2015-12-08 21:33:58</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[War of the Monsters is a 3D fighting game styled after old-school 'creature feature' films of the '50s and '60s, with a variety of playable characters inspired by movie monsters from that era.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7772/589067-art13.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-589067" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="1.5175" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:151.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7772/589067-art13.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-589067"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7772/589067-art13.jpg"></a><figcaption>One of several '50s-style movie posters</figcaption></figure><p style="">In War of the Monsters, players can choose from a number of monsters inspired by films like <a href="/godzilla/3005-3643" data-ref-id="3005-3643">Godzilla</a>, <a href="/king-kong/3005-4239" data-ref-id="3005-4239">King Kong</a> and other monster movies from the same era.

It is a third person action-adventure game based heavily on Greek Mythology. The main character, Kratos, is a fallen spartan general who must solve puzzles, traverse dangerous locales and kill anything that gets in his way.</p><p style="">In this installment we find Kratos riding on the back of the <a href="/titan/3015-2302" data-ref-id="3015-2302"> Titan</a> <a href="/gaia/3005-1317" data-ref-id="3005-1317"> Gaia</a>, the mother of all titans as he climbs <a href="/olympus/3035-259" data-ref-id="3035-259"> Mount Olympus</a> in order to get his revenge against his father, <a href="/zeus/3005-1101" data-ref-id="3005-1101"> Zeus</a>. This journey takes him through a variety of mythycial places such as the <a href="/underworld/3035-1756" data-ref-id="3035-1756"> Underworld</a> home of Hades, the City of Olympia and even inside <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Olympus" rel="nofollow"> Mount Olympus</a> itself.</p><p style="">God of War III was launched originally on March 16th, 2010 in the US followed closely by Australia on March 18th, 2010 and on March 19th, 2010 for European Countries.</p><h2><b>Story</b></h2><p style="">The story picks up directly after the end of God of War II with <a href="/kratos/3005-645" data-ref-id="3005-645"> Kratos</a> riding on top of the <a href="/gaia/3005-1317" data-ref-id="3005-1317"> Titan Gaia</a>, headed towards <a href="/olympus/3035-259" data-ref-id="3035-259"> Mount Olympus</a>, so that Kratos can get his revenge on <a href="/zeus/3005-1101" data-ref-id="3005-1101"> Zeus</a>. Standing with Zeus is <a href="/poseidon/3005-1347" data-ref-id="3005-1347"> Poseidon</a>, <a href="/hermes/3005-4421" data-ref-id="3005-4421"> Hermes</a>, <a href="/hades/3005-1294" data-ref-id="3005-1294"> Hades</a>, and <a href="/helios/3005-11259" data-ref-id="3005-11259"> Helios</a>. During this scene, Poseidon attacks Gaia impeding the Titans ability to climb Mount Olympus. Kratos is then able to kill Poseidon. Soon after, Gaia along with Kratos are able to reach the top of mount Olympus only to be pushed off by Zeus.</p><p style="">Kratos lands in the river of Styx, where his powers are drained, he than meets Athena's ghost. She gives him the <a href="/blades-of-exile/3055-4107" data-ref-id="3055-4107"> Blades of Exile</a> and helps Kratos on his journey to kill Zeus. Kratos soon learns that Pandora's Box still exists with the power to kill a God even after <a href="/ares/3005-1098" data-ref-id="3005-1098"> Ares</a> died. The box is protected by the Flame of Olympus and the only way to put out the flame and reach the box, is to sacrifice <a href="/pandora/3005-14625" data-ref-id="3005-14625"> Pandora</a>. However, Pandora is being held in a Labyrinth. Once Kratos finds her he takes her up to the flame and makes the sacrifice. Once he opens the box he realizes that it is empty and that he just killed a child for nothing, just as he killed his family in vain. This leaves Kratos with another regret on his mind. After this, Kratos kills Zeus. However, his spirit is still alive and attacks Kratos. Kratos then goes into his own mind and finds hope inside him, forgiving himself for all of the bad things that he had done in his life. Including the killing of <a href="/athena/3005-1145" data-ref-id="3005-1145"> Athena</a>, his Wife, his Daughter and Pandora. Once Kratos returns from inside his own mind, he kills Zeus for good.</p><p style="">Athena tells Kratos that when he first opened Pandora's box he let out all of the good and bad things in it, the good power was the power of hope. The bad powers in the box corrupted the God and Athena's power went to Kratos. This is why after the box was opened for the first time Zeus was corrupted by fear, and he became obsessed with killing Kratos. Athena then tells Kratos that she wants her power back, Kratos refuses then impales himself with the sword of Olympus, releasing the power for the whole world to use and angering Athena. Kratos is now then left dead on the ground in a pool of blood.</p><p style="">Once the credits are done rolling, you see the place where Kratos was lying dead, however there is a blood trail leading off the edge of a cliff with no body in sight, potentially leaving room for another sequel.</p><h2>The David Jaffe Plot Cut</h2><p style="">In an interview with GameTrailers David Jaffe explained that he had a completely different plot line for God of War 3. In his version the game would start off with a boss fight between Kratos and Zeus which at the end of it Zeus gets killed by Kratos. The moment Zeus dies we would see all the other god from other mythologies, mainly Norse and Egyptian, appear in Mount. Olympus since the death of Zeus left a sort of power vacuum in Mount. Olympus. The other gods would then start fighting amongst themselves in order to figure out who will take over the world. Kratos would then meet his egyptian and norse counterparts who would explained to him that they too have been seeking vengeance on the gods and would then merge their powers together in order to give them a better chance at winning. Kratos then realizes that in order to kill the gods you need to make mortals stop believing in them. Without realizing Kratos' plan was already in effect. Because the gods were too busy with their infighting they forgot about the mortal world and as such the world started getting plagued with all sorts of natural disasters. In their absence the people's prayers for salvation go unanswered and because of that the people stopped believing in the gods. This gives all three versions of kratos' the edge they needed and they proceeds to kill gods from various mythologies. The game would end after all the gods were dead some killed by the Titans and some were killed by the egyptian and norse version of Kratos and the Titans restoring order to the world. Kratos would then commit suicide by his blades in order to be with his family and to finally be at peace. The final scene in the game would be the player controlling the three wise men following the north star (there a picture which depicts this scene in God of War 2) and thus the birth of a new religion.</p><p style="">In this version would have seen kratos fighting the mighty gorgon <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stheno" rel="nofollow"> Stheno</a> and eventually chopping off her head in accordance with the Rule of Three (In previous games Kratos killed Stheno younger sisters <a href="/euryale/3005-1300" data-ref-id="3005-1300"> Euryale</a> and <a href="/medusa/3005-1100" data-ref-id="3005-1100"> Medusa</a>). The game would have also feature the sphinx as a boss fight with Kratos fighting him then using the Head of Stheno in order to to turn the sphinx into stone which would explain his present location. The game would have also feature Kratos fighting Thor and Ra.</p><h2><b>Gameplay</b></h2><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10024/837774-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-837774" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.83333333333333" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:83.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10024/837774-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-837774"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10024/837774-4.jpg"></a><figcaption>Kratos wearing the Cestus</figcaption></figure><p style="">The gameplay is reminiscent of previous games in the series, consisting of battling a variety of gruesome enemies with a range of weapons and magical attacks.</p><p style="">Kratos is able to mount giant Cyclopes and use them in a vehicular fashion to take out enemies, or he can jump and grab flying enemies, kill them, and dive bomb back to the ground sending enemies flying into the air. A small portion of the game takes place while Kratos is riding the enormous Titans, and therefore the levels dynamically change and move around based on how the Titans are climbing or moving. If they stand up, the level suddenly becomes a vertical playing field and so on. Another interesting not is that the enemy is already much better then previous games, however if there is a field commander present at the location that Kratos is currently in, the enemies will fight even harder and attempt to flank Kratos. An example of the field commanders that have already been shown is the Centaur.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/888268-2uzqh3b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-888268" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/888268-2uzqh3b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-888268"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/19745/888268-2uzqh3b.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/19745/888268-2uzqh3b.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>You will die!</figcaption></figure><p style="">Similar to the head of the Medusa from the original game, Kratos acquires the head of the God Helios which has a couple of uses that Kratos will exploit. The first one is that the head reveals hidden doors that were cloaked from view, thanks to the wide sunbeams that are projected from his mouth. The second use for the head is as a lantern. Another item that you will obtain in God of War III is the Boots of Hermes. These are described in the game as, "Shoes taken from the messenger of the gods. They grant the gift of agility." With these Boots you are able to run along side of walls and up walls that would be impossible to jump up. Kratos will also have the Bow of Apollo, a fiery bow that once belonged to the God Apollo. With this bow you can set fire to some objects that block your path. You can also use this against enemies, you can set them on fire by charging up the bow or you can quickly tap the button to fire rapidly.</p><p style="">All of the weapons in God of War III have a grapple attack. With this all new attack you can throw yourself towards an enemy. Every weapon in the game is able to use this attack. It is performed by holding the L1 button and pressing .</p><h2>Weapons</h2><h3>Blades of Exile</h3><p style="">These blades will be your most powerful ally against Olympus. They are Kratos' signature weapons, similar to his weapons in the first and second games: Blades of Chaos and Blades of Athena. They are given to you by Athena.</p><p style=""><b>Magic attack:</b></p><p style="">Summons a dome of shields that fall from the sky, damaging all nearby enemies. Spears then thrust from the shields in all directions, damaging all enemies at a further range. Upon further upgrading, a prompt will appear telling the player to repeatedly press the button, causing a flurry of arrows to fall from the sky, again damaging all enemies at an even further range.</p><h3><b>Claws of Hades</b></h3><p style="">Taken from Lord Hades, these cruel hooks grant you power over souls. This purple weapon is very similar to the Blades of Exile, as they have chains that allow for a longer range and wider area. They also differ in speed, as the Claws are a bit faster and less powerful than the Blades of Exile.</p><p style=""><b>Magic attack:</b></p><p style="">Summons souls from fallen enemies to attack for you, you start with three basic souls and gain three with each upgrade.</p><h3>Nemean Cestus</h3><p style="">Flamed Gauntlets given to Hercules when he slew the Nemean Lion. Short Range, slow and very powerful. Taken from Hercules's corpse.</p><p style=""><b>Magic attack:</b></p><p style="">This weapon slams the Gauntlets down to the ground sending a shockwave out in front of Kratos.</p><h3>Nemesis Whip</h3><p style="">Crafted from the Omphalos stone by the smith God Hephaestus. This weapon carries electricity and is able to charge certain objects with electricity in the environment and is used in one small puzzle.</p><p style=""><b>Magic attack:</b></p><p style="">This weapon zaps your enemies with a bolt of electricity.</p><h2>Extras</h2><p style="">Like every God of War game, there are a handful of extra's that you can watch or complete after you beat the main game the first time through. A list of challenges, called "The Challenges of Olympus" is unlocked after your first play through, and a Combat Arena is unlocked after you complete all of the challenges. There is also a documentary video that shows the development of God of War 3 in the extras menu. Also, there are many additional costumes Kratos can gain, unfortunately the only one unlocked from playing the actual game is the fear costume. The other costumes are Apollo, Phantom of Chaos, Forgotten Warrior, Dominus, and Morpheus Armor, these are gained through preorders/promotions with Amazon, Gamestop, Gamecrazy, The Ultimate God of War 3 box, and slurpee.com respectively. An additional game difficulty, Chaos Difficulty, is unlocked after the first play through on any other difficulty.</p><h2>Information</h2><p style=""><a href="/cory-barlog/3040-63532" data-ref-id="3040-63532"> Cory Barlog</a> wrote the overarching story of how the trilogy ends as well as the base of the game layout and design. Barlog also mentioned at a God of War II launch event that this game would run at full 1080p resolution, though it turned out that the final version will run natively in 720p with the ability to upscale to 1080p. The game also supports rumble functions. Barlog also expressed an interest in adding a cooperative mode, but this and the SIXAXIS controls were not put into the final product.</p><p style=""><a href="/david-jaffe/3040-44184" data-ref-id="3040-44184"> David Jaffe</a> has said of the story that, "God of War explains, or ultimately will explain, why there are no more Greek myths." He has also stated that it will be "hell on earth" as the Gods and the Titans battle each other for domination, and that the series will explore the question of whether "man needs god". David Jaffe has expressed interest to be involved in some way with the development of God of War III, but since he left <a href="/sony-computer-entertainment-america/3010-313" data-ref-id="3010-313"> SCEA</a> his influence would be minimal. Barlog has since left SCEA and has stated that the development changes that go on in God of War are, "outta my control now ". <a href="/stig-asmussen/3040-42647" data-ref-id="3040-42647"> Stig Asmussen</a> has taken over the role of director. Asmussen revealed to Gamepro that the endings to the series, under both Jaffe and Barlog, would have been drastically different than what he implemented in God of War III. In Jaffe's ending Kratos would kill Zeus and right around the corner would be Norse Mythology. In Barlog's ending Kratos would become <a href="/death/3005-955" data-ref-id="3005-955"> Death</a> himself and his blades would turn into sickles resembling Death's <a href="/scythe/3055-95" data-ref-id="3055-95"> scythe</a>.</p><ul><li>Unlike the first two iterations in the series where there were only 15 enemies on screen, there will now be up to 50 this time.</li><li>Enemies can also jump on Kratos, eventually weighing him down and smothering him. This can be broken by wiggling the analogue stick.</li></ul><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/888635-73j62t.png" data-ref-id="1300-888635" data-size="large" style="width: 960px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="960" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/888635-73j62t.png" data-ref-id="1300-888635"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/19745/888635-73j62t.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/19745/888635-73j62t.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Example of Kratos breaking out of a pile-up.</figcaption></figure><ul><li>You can ride monsters like the Cyclops and “control” them.</li></ul><ul><li>Kratos on the PlayStation 2 used 5,000 polygons, where as now he uses 20,000.</li></ul><ul><li>Weapons have been added and enhanced to improve variety.

Doom 4]]></aliases><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20654/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-05-18 13:02:24</date_added><date_last_updated>2015-10-31 16:14:47</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[The long-running Doom series gets a new installment simply titled "Doom". The game will be running on id Software's latest game engine idTech 6.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Doom (previously known as Doom 4) is an upcoming game in the <a href="/doom/3025-156" data-ref-id="3025-156">Doom franchise</a>, one that harkens back to the fast-paced run &amp; gunning philosophy of the original two Doom games. The game is running on id Tech 6, or as id software likes to call it "id Tech 666". </p><p style="">On February 19, 2014, along with the reveal of the game's name change, Bethesda Softworks announced beta access for anyone that pre-orders <a href="/wolfenstein-the-new-order/3030-42581" data-ref-id="3030-42581">Wolfenstein: The New Order</a>. </p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">At the Quake Con 2014 unveil it was revealed that the game focuses on high speed movement and run &amp; gun gameplay like the original Doom, and also features a deep combat melee system, including execution animations. There is no regen health system, thus the player will be forced to pick up health from fallen enemies in order to regain health. </p><h2>Development</h2><p style="">At QuakeCon 2008, id announced that Doom 4 will not be available through <a href="/digital-distribution/3015-2329" data-ref-id="3015-2329">digital distribution</a> like many of the company's previous titles. At the press conference, id Software co-founder <a href="/john-carmack/3040-4576" data-ref-id="3040-4576">John Carmack</a> announced that Doom 4 would have "three times as much horsepower as <a href="/rage/3030-20672" data-ref-id="3030-20672">RAGE</a>". The game was then said to run at only 30 frames a second, but despite this, Carmack promises to raise the bar on video game graphics to a level "no one has ever seen before." Later in the event, id CEO <a href="/todd-hollenshead/3040-14696" data-ref-id="3040-14696">Todd Hollenshead</a> contradicted Carmack in a way when he announced id is "not even sure if Doom 4 will be Doom 4."</p><p style="">At Quake-con 2014 a private showing of the game wowed doom fans, but no footage surfaced for the public's viewing pleasure. In a interview it was stated nothing would be shown until 2015.</p><p style="">In interviews John Carmack has implied that the gameplay was to be more action-oriented than the previous title, and looks to shy away from the survival horror elements of <a href="/doom-3/3030-14537" data-ref-id="3030-14537">Doom 3</a>. Namely the excessive darkness, monsters 'hiding in <a href="/monster-closet/3015-1205" data-ref-id="3015-1205">closets</a>', and the relatively limited amount of ammo available.</p><p style="">Early interviews suggest this move away from survival horror to Doom's more traditional focus on action:</p><blockquote><p style="">You get to punctuate a lot more with triumphs and successes, and you just don't get to do that very much in survival horror. You know, you want to say, 'I'm victorious,' not, 'I'm not dead.' It's just a fundamentally more rewarding genre to be in.</p></blockquote><h2>Movie</h2><p style="">Personnel within id software have expressed interest in making a new Doom movie that actually follows the <a href="/doom/3030-7326" data-ref-id="3030-7326">Doom</a> storyline, unlike the original <a href="/tang-doom/2300-457" data-ref-id="2300-457">Doom movie</a> starring <a href="/the-rock/3005-1674" data-ref-id="3005-1674">The Rock</a>. Todd Hollenshead has openly aired his interest in a possible Doom movie following the storyline of Doom 4 itself, whatever that may be. He hopes that the hype for Doom 4 will encourage Universal Studios into talks about the project's possibility.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year>2016</expected_release_year><id>20654</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/18/187968/2755215-rsz_71pgyubdlll_sl1500_.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/18/187968/2755215-rsz_71pgyubdlll_sl1500_.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/18/187968/2755215-rsz_71pgyubdlll_sl1500_.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/18/187968/2755215-rsz_71pgyubdlll_sl1500_.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/18/187968/2755215-rsz_71pgyubdlll_sl1500_.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/18/187968/2755215-rsz_71pgyubdlll_sl1500_.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/18/187968/2755215-rsz_71pgyubdlll_sl1500_.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Doom]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating/><original_release_date/><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-145/]]></api_detail_url><id>145</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox One]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-one/3045-145/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[XONE]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/]]></api_detail_url><id>146</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 4]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS4]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/doom/3030-20654/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[DD]]></aliases><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20752/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-06-21 17:45:04</date_added><date_last_updated>2015-10-23 13:14:03</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[A game credited, in part, with the popularity of the brawler genre in the arcade craze of the 1980s and 1990s.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Originally released in 1987 in arcades, Double Dragon is an early brawler game credited, in part, for the popularity of the beat-em-up genre during the 1980s and 1990s. The game was first developed by <a href="/technos-japan-corp/3010-452" data-ref-id="3010-452">Technos Japan Corporation</a> and published by <a href="/taito-corporation/3010-135" data-ref-id="3010-135">Taito Corporation</a>, and has since been ported to numerous consoles, computers, handhelds, and even cellular phones. The game also spawned the popular <a href="/double-dragon/3025-158" data-ref-id="3025-158">Double Dragon</a> franchise, which has had five games in the main franchise, as well as two <a href="/neo-geo/3045-25" data-ref-id="3045-25">Neo-Geo</a> fighting games.</p><p style="">After the initial arcade release, the game has been ported to a variety of systems, including the <a href="/nes/3045-21" data-ref-id="3045-21">Nintendo Entertainment System</a>, <a href="/sega-master-system/3045-8" data-ref-id="3045-8">Sega Master System</a>, <a href="/zx-spectrum/3045-16" data-ref-id="3045-16">ZX Spectrum</a>, <a href="/amstrad-cpc/3045-11" data-ref-id="3045-11">Amstrad CPC</a>, <a href="/commodore-64/3045-14" data-ref-id="3045-14">Commodore 64</a> (two different versions), <a href="/pc/3045-94" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC</a>, <a href="/atari-st/3045-13" data-ref-id="3045-13">Atari ST</a>, <a href="/amiga/3045-1" data-ref-id="3045-1">Amiga</a>, <a href="/atari-2600/3045-40" data-ref-id="3045-40">Atari 2600</a>, <a href="/atari-7800/3045-70" data-ref-id="3045-70">Atari 7800</a>, <a href="/game-boy/3045-3" data-ref-id="3045-3">Game Boy</a>, <a href="/genesis/3045-6" data-ref-id="3045-6">Sega Genesis</a>, <a href="/lynx/3045-7" data-ref-id="3045-7">Atari Lynx</a>, <a href="/xbox-live-marketplace/3045-86" data-ref-id="3045-86">Xbox Live Arcade</a>, <a href="/zeebo/3045-122" data-ref-id="3045-122">Zeebo</a>, <a href="/iphone/3045-96" data-ref-id="3045-96">iPhone</a> and <a href="/android/3045-123" data-ref-id="3045-123">Android</a>. Every release differs in some aspect or another, particularly the <a href="/game-gear/3045-5" data-ref-id="3045-5">Game Gear</a>, NES, Game Boy, and Atari 2600 versions.</p><p style="">The game's popularity led to several sequels (with the latest iteration released in 2003), a cartoon series (which ran for two seasons), a comic book (published by Marvel, ran for six issues), and even a movie (which was released in 1994, inspired by the television cartoon). The cartoon and its resulting movie release were both loosely based on the NES version of the game, whereas Jimmy Lee is initially a villain (having been raised by the antagonist of the franchise, the <a href="/shadow-master/3005-14811" data-ref-id="3005-14811">Shadow Master</a>).</p><p style="">The game's soundtrack was composed by <a href="/kazunaka-yamane/3040-23791" data-ref-id="3040-23791">Kazunaka Yamane</a>, and was released in an album on February 21, 1988. The soundtrack, titled Original Sound of Double Dragon, features all nine tracks from the arcade version of the game. These tracks are all arranged versions of the songs found in the game.</p><h3>Gameplay</h3><p style="">Double Dragon follows <a href="/billy-lee/3005-2644" data-ref-id="3005-2644">Billy Lee</a> and <a href="/jimmy-lee/3005-2550" data-ref-id="3005-2550">Jimmy Lee</a> (incorrectly named Hammer and Spike in the promotional materials with the American version of the arcade game), two martial artists whose love interest, Marian, is kidnapped by a gang called the Black Warriors. Playing in cooperative mode triggers a different ending, where Billy and Jimmy must fight each other for the affection of Marian.</p><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/139866/2708118-032204.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2708118" data-ratio="0.74707602339181" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:74.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/139866/2708118-032204.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2708118"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/139866/2708118-032204.jpg"></a><figcaption>The Black Warriors kidnapping Marian in the Arcade version</figcaption></figure><p style="">A three button beat-em-up, there are three base moves in Double Dragon; punching, kicking, and jumping. Various combinations of these moves produce other moves, such as head butts, elbow smashes, jumping kicks, backwards kicks, or the signature Double Dragon hair grab (in which the character grabs the enemy by the hair, making them vulnerable to attacks and throws).</p><p style="">In addition to moves, Double Dragon has a variety of weapons that can be carried from fight to fight (this was altered in the NES version, where weapons could only be used if the enemy it was taken from is still alive). There are four weapons; baseball bats, whips (neither of which are incredibly effective), knives (which are arguably the most powerful weapons in the game), and explosives (timed explosives which can be thrown).</p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h3>NES Version</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15051/388784-dd2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-388784" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.66666666666667" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:66.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15051/388784-dd2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-388784"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15051/388784-dd2.jpg"></a><figcaption>Only two enemies can be on-screen simultaneously in NES version</figcaption></figure><p style="">Released in 1988 (and later on the <a href="../../wii-shop/60-87/" rel="nofollow">Wii Virtual Console</a> in 2008), the NES version of Double Dragon was among the better received ports of the game. Published by <a href="../../tradewest-inc/65-173/" rel="nofollow">Tradewest</a>, Double Dragon on the NES has many differences from the arcade game on which it is based, beyond the obvious decrease in graphical and sound quality. The plot was altered, due to the exclusion of a two-player cooperative mode. Rather than fighting the leader of the Shadow Warriors, <a href="../../billy-lee/94-2644/" rel="nofollow">Billy Lee</a> faces off against his brother, <a href="../../jimmy-lee/94-2550/" rel="nofollow">Jimmy Lee</a>.</p><p style="">Other than the single player story, there are a few other modes that implement two player gameplay. Mode A allows players to do a tag-team style game, alternating who is playing after each death. Mode B is a one-on-one tournament fighting game, where players can choose to fight either computer controlled opponents or player controlled characters.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5312/503003-doubledragon_44.png" data-ref-id="1300-503003" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.875" data-width="256" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 256px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:87.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5312/503003-doubledragon_44.png" data-ref-id="1300-503003"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5312/503003-doubledragon_44.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5312/503003-doubledragon_44.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>The two player fighting mode in NES version</figcaption></figure><p style="">The game also implemented an upgrade system, where players earn hearts for dispatching certain amounts of enemies. These hearts upgrade the character's abilities, allowing for more complicated moves such as backwards elbowing and face punching. In addition to moves, there are a variety of weapons available, ranging from baseball bats to whips (as well as ranging in damage dealt, and subsequently usefulness).</p><p style="">There are many other differences found in the NES version, some due to general technical limitations. For example, only two enemies can be onscreen simultaneously due to the NES's abilities. Naturally, the stage design deviates from what was found in the original arcade version, including new areas, expanded sections, and completely new levels.</p><h3>Master System Version</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17744/594771-doubledcombat.gif" data-ref-id="1300-594771" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="256" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 256px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17744/594771-doubledcombat.gif" data-ref-id="1300-594771"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/17744/594771-doubledcombat.gif" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/17744/594771-doubledcombat.gif"></noscript></a><figcaption>Sega Master System home console port of Double Dragon</figcaption></figure><p style="">After the NES version was released, <a href="/sega/3010-62" data-ref-id="3010-62">Sega</a> brought the game to their 8-bit platform as well. Due to the <a href="/sega-master-system/3045-8" data-ref-id="3045-8">Sega Master System</a>'s more powerful hardware, the Master System version has better graphics (with more colors), more enemies on-screen, and modes and levels that are very similar to the arcade version.</p><p style="">Unlike the NES version of Double Dragon, the Sega Master System version retains the two-player cooperative mode found in the original arcade version. Although it doesn't include the head-to-head versus mode found in the NES game, Double Dragon on the Sega Master System does have one other feature not found in the NES or arcade versions; an unlimited amount of continues (except for the final level).</p><h3>Mega Drive/Genesis Version</h3><p style="">In 1992, Double Dragon was ported to the <a href="/genesis/3045-6" data-ref-id="3045-6">Sega Mega Drive/Genesis</a>. This game was developed by Ballistic, and is very similar to the arcade release. Double Dragon on the Sega Genesis was criticized for one key aspect; its control. The game, according to fans and critics, makes it incredibly difficult to hit enemies, with small hit boxes and sloppy movement.</p><h3>Handheld Versions</h3><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6150/504872-ddgg5.gif" data-ref-id="1300-504872" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.9" data-width="160" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 160px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:90.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6150/504872-ddgg5.gif" data-ref-id="1300-504872"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6150/504872-ddgg5.gif" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6150/504872-ddgg5.gif"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Game Gear version only features Billy Lee as a playable character</figcaption></figure><p style="">The game has had three different handheld ports; Game Boy, Sega Game Gear, and Atari Lynx. The first of these three versions was released in 1990. The Game Boy version of Double Dragon is heavily influenced by the NES game, with similar level design, enemies, and overall graphical style.</p><p style="">The Game Boy version varies on one key aspect from the NES Double Dragon; it does not include the heart system found in this game. Every move is accessible from the start. In some areas, portions of stages were removed completely for the Game Boy port, particularly some platforming segments of the final stage. Additionally, every character in the two player fighting mode was removed except for Billy Lee and Jimmy Lee.</p><p style="">On the Game Gear, Double Dragon was significantly different from other versions of the game. Subtitled "The Revenge of Billy Lee" in Europe, this game centers around the murder of Jimmy Lee, and Billy Lee's quest of vengeance against the Dragon Clan. Other than this, the game was largely a different game, with altered stage design, different weapons (i.e. guns), and the lack of any modes beyond a single player story mode.</p><p style="">With large sprites, the Atari Lynx version is another recreation of the original arcade game. Giving only a small view of the stage, the game was criticized due to the fact that enemy and character sprites take up nearly three fourths of the Lynx's screen size. The Atari Lynx version also includes a practice mode, which allows players to fight a varying amount of enemies to learn the controls and moves of the game.</p><p style="">In 2003 the game received an enhanced remake for the Game Boy Advance in the form of <a href="/double-dragon-advance/3030-20754" data-ref-id="3030-20754">Double Dragon Advance</a>, which added several new features including cutscenes, additional levels, and new moves.</p><h3>Smartphone Version</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/71263/2252732-doubledragoniphone.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2252732" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.66666666666667" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:66.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/71263/2252732-doubledragoniphone.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2252732"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/7/71263/2252732-doubledragoniphone.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/7/71263/2252732-doubledragoniphone.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Smartphone version</figcaption></figure><p style="">In 2011 a smartphone version of Double Dragon was released on both iPhone and Android. Rather than a straight port, this version adds several features, some of which originated in the Game Boy Advance remake. In addition to the Lee brothers, players can unlock 24 playable characters for use in any mode.</p><h3>Other Versions</h3><p style="">Like the sequels to Double Dragon, <a href="/binary-design-ltd/3010-496" data-ref-id="3010-496">Binary Designs</a> worked on computer ports to create a variety of versions of the game. Additionally, a second Commodore 64 port was created by <a href="/ocean-software-ltd/3010-6983" data-ref-id="3010-6983">Ocean Software</a>, and differed in many ways from the previous Commodore 64 port. While all of the games naturally differ from the arcade game on which they are based, there are several relevant details relating to the ports.</p><p style="">The ZX Spectrum version was incredibly different when it came to graphical style. Due to an attempt at the detail of the arcade version, this version had character and enemy sprites which were transparent other than the black outlines. This, combined with an attempt at some detailed color, caused the game to run very slowly.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1339851-dd26_4.gif" data-ref-id="1300-1339851" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="304" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 304px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1339851-dd26_4.gif" data-ref-id="1300-1339851"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1339851-dd26_4.gif" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1339851-dd26_4.gif"></noscript></a><figcaption>Both of the Atari versions of the game were created by Activision</figcaption></figure><p style="">Both of the Commodore 64 ports were very close in style, attempting to emulate the gameplay of the arcade release (the first even included a two player mode, almost unheard of among the computer ports). A major difference for the first version was a complete lack of sound, other than the sound effects created by punching and kicking. The second version lacked a two player mode, although it is considered by Double Dragon fans to be a slightly better port.</p><p style="">Also released for the Atari 2600 and Atari 7800, these two ports were handled by <a href="/activision/3010-78" data-ref-id="3010-78">Activision</a>. The 2600 version of the game naturally cut much of the game's content; with redone sound and graphics to fit the platform's capabilities, removed enemy sprites, cut weapons, and a shorter story mode (although there is still a two player cooperative mode, as well as a two player versus mode). The 7800 version was improved graphically and sound-wise, although it removes the versus mode.</p><h3>Soundtrack</h3><ol><li>Opening (Double Dragon)</li><li>The City Slums (The Black Warriors Arrive)</li><li>The Industrial Area (The Great Fray)</li><li>After the Battle</li><li>Setting Off (A New Battle)</li><li>The Woods</li><li>The Giant Abobo Appears</li><li>The Hideout (Willy the Nemesis)</li><li>Ending (Reunion With Marian)</li></ol><h2>Trivia</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1363166-baddudes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1363166" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.3305489260143" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:133.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1363166-baddudes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1363166"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1363166-baddudes.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1363166-baddudes.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Data East's Bad Dudes advertisement.</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Two Amstrad CPC ports of Double Dragon were created.

Two major powers exist in this alternate world: the Atlantic Federation in the West controls most of the Europan peninsula, and the East Europan Alliance, known simply as 'the Empire", controls the East. Sitting in between both of these superpowers is the small nation of <a href="/gallia/3035-3295" data-ref-id="3035-3295">Gallia</a>, home to an ancient bloodline, simple people, and a major reserve of ragnite ore. Ragnite is a miraculous ore that is used for many things, from powering vehicle and tank engines to providing Ragnaid's restorative powers. As the news of dwindling ragnite sources becomes a concern, the Empire launches a full invasion of the Atlantic Federation with a focus on Gallia itself, ostensibly to secure its ragnite. With Gallia struggling against this blitzkrieg, the story focuses on the actions of Squad 7, under command of Lieutenant Welkin Gunther, son of a famous war hero and a would-be natural sciences teacher, and Sergeant Alicia Melchiott, a would-be baker. Both first met each other within the village of Bruhl and found themselves fighting beside each other on the day the Empire's forces ruthlessly attack the city.</p><p style="">Through several daring missions, Gallia's forces manage to drive the Empire back, forcing its army to regroup. It is also discovered that the motivation behind the Empire's attack is not because of ragnite but because of interest in an all-powerful weapon left behind by an ancient race called the Valkyrur, which he believes to be hidden within the walls of Gallia's capital. According to legend, the Valkyrur had come down from the north and had used their incredible powers to defeat the Darcsen people who are blamed for nearly destroying the continent centuries earlier in a terrible war. Many doubt the existence of the Valkyrur today and consider them only as legend, but it is soon revealed that one of the Empire's generals, Selvaria Bles, is of Valkyrian blood. Displaying supernatural powers on the battlefield such as deflecting a tank shell with her shield or destroying an entire regiment of tanks on her own, she quickly turns the early victory of the Gallian army into a near rout singlehandedly until it is revealed that Alicia Melchiott is also of Valkyrian blood.</p><p style="">After defeating Selvaria, Alicia has severe doubts about her new role. Prince Maximilian, the commander of the Empire's invasion of the West, tells Selvaria that she must use the Final Flame. Selvaria's devotion to the Prince, born out of his mercy to her when he had her taken away from the Imperial testing facility where they were using her as a guinea pig, is challenged when he asks her to make the ultimate sacrifice. Devoted to both her duty and her unrequited love for her Prince, she makes preparations for the end.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2488/219384-vc1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-219384" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2488/219384-vc1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-219384"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2488/219384-vc1.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2488/219384-vc1.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Alicia Melchiott</figcaption></figure><p style="">At the fortress of Ghirlandaio on the border of Gallia and the Empire, Squad 7 and the Atlantic Federation engage Imperial forces in a decisive battle to end the war. Selvaria returns and challenges Squad 7 and Alicia to a duel between her forces and theirs without the use of her powers. In this final confrontation, Selvaria is finally defeated but gives herself up honorably. She is treated well by Squad 7 when she is captured. Alicia asks Selvaria how she deals with being a Valkyrur to which Selvaria replies that she must find something to believe in. When the Gallian army's commander arrives and Selvaria speaks without turn, he has a soldier smash the back of her head with the butt of a rifle. Gasping in pain, she asks only one thing: that Squad 7 escort her men, the Imperial prisoners, back to Gallia. The general laughs and accedes her request.</p><p style="">Later, as the Gallian general gloats in what had been Prince Maximilian's war room as he sits on his throne, Selvaria asks how long it has been since Squad 7 had left. The general says that several hours had already passed. Selvaria smiles to herself and begins burning with a blue light, awakening the Valkyrur power within her as she breaks her chains. The general orders her shot and bullets tear into her, but Selvaria's devotion to the Prince and to her duty give her the strength to demonstrate her will to fulfill her role. With one final speech, she invokes the Final Flame, annihilating the fortress and most of the Gallian army that had occupied it. Squad 7 witness the destruction from miles away as bolts of power sear the landscape, leaving the same type of scars seen in the Barious Desert. Alicia is shaken by Selvaria's sacrifice and questions herself if that is what it means to be a Valkyrur.</p><p style="">Prince Maximilian suddenly launches an attack with a mobile fortress which is the equivalent of a land battleship. With nothing to stand against it and most of the Gallian army destroyed by Selvaria's sacrifice, Alicia is determined to sacrifice her own life in order to use her new found power to destroy it. After chasing her down, Welkin is able to convince Alicia that there is more of a reason to live and that her powers don't make her any different as he confesses his love for her. Realizing that her new family in Squad 7, along with Welkin's love, represent the only power that should matter, she relents her attack with this new found purpose.</p><p style="">After this revelation, the members of Squad 7 race back to the capital in an effort to stop the Prince.

With the weapon's destruction, the Prince confronts Squad 7 in a final battle. Fueled by super science and bearing mock Valkyrur weaponry, the Prince attempts to destroy the Squad but after a pitched battle, defeat him at last. In a climactic finish, Welkin and Alicia are rescued from the exploding battleship by a glider that Isara had built. The fate of each squad member is revealed as the credits roll along with a list of those that had survived and those that may have died. Afterwards, it is shown that Alicia and Welkin are now husband and wife and have a daughter, Isara, as life returns to normal.</p><p style="">Aside from the main story, the game is also notable for dealing with many mature subjects, which have parallels with the Second World War. Genocide, prejudice, and racism against the Darcsen people, recognizable in the game by their dark hair, is depicted among both Gallian and Imperial peoples. For example; within Squad 7, Rosie openly shows her hate towards Darcsens, in particular Isara, the team's tank pilot and Welkin's adopted half-sister.</p><h2>Battle System</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15434/768510-vcdlc_09.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-768510" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15434/768510-vcdlc_09.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-768510"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15434/768510-vcdlc_09.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15434/768510-vcdlc_09.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>How aiming looks.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Called "BLiTZ", for "Battle of Live Tactical Zones", Valkyria Chronicles combines real-time and turn-based tactical combat. Each side takes its action in separate phases. Individual units can be activated by using "Command Points" (CP), and different unit classes cost different amounts of command points to activate, with Infantry using up one point and tanks using up two. Once activated, the unit can freely move about the battlefield in real-time, using weapons and abilities. As the unit moves, it can come under suppressing fire from enemy positions. Damage on enemies can also be increased by targeting the head, using mortars and grenades to destroy their cover, or using appropriate counter-units.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/495/628803-valk.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-628803" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/495/628803-valk.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-628803"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/495/628803-valk.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/495/628803-valk.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Planning the next move.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Units also have special abilities and traits called "Potentials" that affect their battlefield performance. For example, a unit with the "Child of Nature" potential feels uncomfortable operating on paved roads, lowering their accuracy, while a "Maternal" unit feels the need to protect her family, making her more effective when near units she has a close relationship with. Units also have relationships with other units, which can affect combination attacks, potential activation, and other factors. Commanders can also issue special orders, which can be specialized attacks or temporary boosts to unit attributes or performance.</p><p style="">Some unit classes are more effective against other unit types.</p><h3>The Classes</h3><h3 style="margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;">Scouts</h3><p style="">Scouts are the most agile soldier class in the game and their superior eyesight also lets them spot enemies hidden in tall grass from afar. Equipped with a standard caliber rifle, they lack the means to face enemy combat forces head on, but their high stamina can make the scout a valid flanking option. As a secondary weapon, the scout is equipped with a grenade and upgrading him or her to elite status will unlock a grenade launcher attachment.</p><h3 style="margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;">Shocktroopers</h3><p style="">The standard soldier unit armed with a high-power machine gun, ideal for taking on any type of foot soldiers from up close. They are good all-around units with no obvious weaknesses, but lack any specialties and are less mobile than the scout class. Shocktroopers also carry a grenade. Upon reaching elite status, they gain a flamethrower ideally used in close quarters, capable of hitting multiple enemies in close proximity with one action or bypassing cover to hit a defending enemy.</p><h3 style="margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;">Lancers</h3><p style="">This class is designed to damage tanks and armored vehicles with their large rocket-tipped lances, and also have enough defense to withstand the heavy blast attacks from mortars and tank rounds. Their low mobility and limited ammo renders them vulnerable to infantry attacks.</p><h3 style="margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;">Engineers</h3><p style="">Impractical in front line combat, as they have low offensive and defensive capabilities, Engineers are best suited to the support role. The ability to restore ammo, remove land mines, fix sandbags and sniper towers, repair tanks and on top of that having a respectable mobility fills that role well.</p><h3 style="margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;">Snipers</h3><p style="">Equipped with long-range rifles, snipers can easily take down enemy soldiers from a considerable distance. But low defensive capability and limited mobility weakens this class when facing multiple foes.</p><h3 style="margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;">Tanks</h3><p style="">These are equipped with highly destructive firepower, and they boast armor that shrugs off attacks from normal infantry - only lancers, other tanks, and special anti-tank cannons can damage them in head-on combat. To prevent overheating, however, tanks have an unarmored radiator in their rear, which is vulnerable to attacks of all kinds. These vehicles can also run over obstacles, such as sandbags or trees. The Tanks have two sections, the body and the tread. If the body is severely damaged the tank will be destroyed, while if the tread is destroyed the tank will survive but will suffer from a decrease in its mobility. Tanks are equipped with multiple weapons, including machine guns, anti-armor rounds, and wide area of effect mortars. The protagonist's primary tank is the <i>Edelweiss</i>, an experimental high-mobility unit developed during the First Europan War. Tanks can be upgraded in the hangar by attaching special equipment or attribute-boosting parts.</p><h3 style="margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;">Medics (not playable)</h3><p style="">When a unit's HP reaches zero it will remain on the ground. If the unit remains there for three turns, or if an enemy touches them they will become completely incapacitated and be permanently removed from the game. As friendly units approach a downed ally, or upon an order from Welkin, a medic can be called, evacuating the unit from battle to fight again later.</p><h2>Crossover Characters</h2><p style="">As a crossover feature, Valkyria Chronicles includes two playable characters from Sega's <a href="/skies-of-arcadia/3030-1609" data-ref-id="3030-1609">Skies of Arcadia</a>, originally released on the <a href="/dreamcast/3045-37" data-ref-id="3045-37">Dreamcast</a>.

When he first returns back to Bruhl, his hometown, he is arrested by Alica who accuses him of being an imperial spy. He uses the Edelweiss, his late father's tank, during combat. After holding the imperials off long enough, he allows the residents of Bruhl to escape. He and Alicia themselves then escape to Randgriz, capital of Gallia. There, Welkin sings up for the Gallian militia. He is appointed Squad Leader due to his exploits in Bruhl. During certain missions when he is not using the tank, Welkin is a scout unit. For a squad leader he is considered young. Initially his squad members are skeptical of his leadership abilities, but after demonstrating his military genius, combined with his extensive knowledge of nature, he formulates a plan to drive his tank across a river and launch a surprise attack on the enemies camp. After this, the squad's members don't question him and soon develop a liking to him. As the game progresses, he soon brings all of the squad members together, to the point where they start to consider each other as family. He is also awarded the Gallian medal of Honour due to his numerous successes in battle.

Because she is a Darcsen (a certain race of people in the game's world), she is discriminated against. However, Welkin always comes in to defend his sister. Because of this, Isara vows to repay Welkin, and she decides to do this by building him an airplane, so that he may fly. During the game's time period, only a couple of other planes exist. She and Rosie initially fight, due to Rosie hating Darcsens at first. However, after Rosie witnesses the genocide and slavery of the Darcsen people, she realizes how inhuman she was being.

He is in charge of the Empire's tank division and is said to have won his battles by using "Advanced Tank Tactics". He drives a very powerful tank called Lupus Regnum, that has an outer armor shell. He is placed in charge of the Southern invasion of Gallia. Near the end of the game, Squad 7 faces off with Jaeger. Jaeger is defeated and his tank destroyed. He congratulates Squad 7 and resigns from the Imperial army, having recognized the strength of the squad's will to fight for their homeland as he fought for his.</p><h2>PC System Requirements</h2><h3>Minimum</h3><ul><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows Vista/Windows 7</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core2 Duo @ 2.0GHz (or equivalent)</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2 GB RAM</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> NVIDIA GeForce GTS 240 (or equivalent)</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong> 25 GB available space</li></ul><h3>Recommended</h3><ul><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 7</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core2 Duo @ 2.8GHz (or equivalent)</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 3 GB RAM</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> NVIDIA GeForce GTX 280 (or equivalent)</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong> 25 GB available space</li></ul>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>20971</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/82063/2698054-vcclean.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82063/2698054-vcclean.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/82063/2698054-vcclean.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2698054-vcclean.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/82063/2698054-vcclean.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/82063/2698054-vcclean.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/82063/2698054-vcclean.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Valkyria Chronicles]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>18</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-1/]]></api_detail_url><id>1</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: T]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-2/]]></api_detail_url><id>2</id><name><![CDATA[PEGI: 16+]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-33/]]></api_detail_url><id>33</id><name><![CDATA[CERO: B]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-31/]]></api_detail_url><id>31</id><name><![CDATA[OFLC: M]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2008-04-22 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/]]></api_detail_url><id>146</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 4]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS4]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/valkyria-chronicles/3030-20971/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[All Points Bulletin

According to the   developer, this will be the first MMORPG in which the player's own  skill,  not the amount of time invested, would be the main factor in  character  progression. There have been several rumors surrounding the  game,  including that<a href=""> </a> <a data-ref-id="3010-1194" href="/rockstar-games/3010-1194">                                          Rockstar Games</a> was planning on  purchasing APB in order to turn it into a <a data-ref-id="3025-6" href="/grand-theft-auto/3025-6">                                         Grand Theft Auto</a><a href=""> </a>  MMORPG.<br /> <br />You can purchase a retail version of APB either in-store or via  digital download at standard retail price.  The game includes 50 hours of action game play out of the box plus  unlimited time in APB's social districts. Once your game time is up, you will have the option of buying another 20 hours for $7, or a monthly subscription for $10/month. You will also have the possibility to sell your customized designs for RTW points, which can be used to buy extended game time.<br /><br />The  quests given by <a data-ref-id="3015-967" href="/non-player-character/3015-967">                                                    NPC</a>s will be more focused  on the <a href="">                                                                                      PvP</a>  aspect of the game. The main game  designer <a data-ref-id="3040-33179" href="/e-j-moreland/3040-33179">                                     EJ Moreland</a> says that, for  example, in other MMOs, players  are asked to get 10 bat wings. In APB,  you will have to kill other  players to get whatever the NPC requires.  The enforcers will be  required to protect the common NPCs (citizens),  patrol the streets, and  catch wanted criminals.  <br /><br />Rather than rely on a traditional <a data-ref-id="3015-39" href="/experience-points/3015-39">                                    XP</a> leveling system, APB uses a form of <a data-ref-id="3015-2163" href="/ranking-system/3015-2163">                                   ranking</a> called Prestige (for Enforcers) and Notoriety (for Criminals). Able to both rise and fall, the system is designed to encourage players to play their chosen faction as intended. As a result, Enforcers can expect their Prestige to rise when making a successful arrest or fall by harming innocent bystanders, whereas Criminals will find their Notoriety increase by evading capture and decrease if arrested. APB will not feature typical MMO mechanics such as <a data-ref-id="3015-382" href="/skill-tree/3015-382">                                 Talent Trees</a>, <a data-ref-id="3015-2220" href="/skill-points/3015-2220">                                Skill Points</a> or even <a data-ref-id="3015-405" href="/classes/3015-405">                               Classes</a>, instead players are able to customize the role of their character by using the in-game currency to purchase upgrades.<br /><br />Professions in APB will also be very different compared to existing MMOs and, if anything, is more comparable to games such as <a data-ref-id="3030-24995" href="/forza-motorsport-3/3030-24995">                              Forza Motorsport 3</a>. Players will be able to earn in-game currency by creating various items and then selling them via a <a data-ref-id="3015-2136" href="/auction-house/3015-2136">                             Auction House</a>. Created items can vary greatly, from unique artwork and vinyl, to custom clothing and even heavily modified vehicles.     <br /><br /><h2>Factions <br /></h2>Designed around the common 'cops vs. robbers' theme, APB will feature only 2 factions - Enforcers and Criminals. Each faction will have multiple organizations that players may choose to align themselves with however there will be no character classes as such. <br /><br /><h3>Enforcers    </h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1750/1329647-larocha.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1329647" data-size="medium" style="width: 395px" data-ratio="2.1012658227848" data-width="395" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:210.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1750/1329647-larocha.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1329647"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1750/1329647-larocha.jpg"></a><figcaption>  Sometimes a badge is all that separates the enforcers from the criminals. </figcaption></figure>     Not your typical policeman, Enforcers are deputized mercenaries tasked with cleaning up the city of San-Paro. Given a gun and a badge, they have the freedom to enforce the law however they see fit, but reckless use of lethal force carries consequences. <br /> <br />Fresh-faced recruits have the option of aligning themselves with one of two enforcer organizations, the Praetorians or the Prentiss Tigers. Each featuring their own unique chain of command, players are able to work their way up the ranks of their chosen organization by accepting missions from <a data-ref-id="3015-967" href="/non-player-character/3015-967">                                                                       NPC</a> contacts. As the player progresses, the will receive missions from increasingly higher ranking contacts <br /> <br />Enforcers are incentivised to adhere to a code of conduct that prohibits such things as harming innocent <a data-ref-id="3015-967" href="/non-player-character/3015-967">                                                                      NPC</a> bystanders or dangerous driving and rewards using non-lethal force whenever possible. That however is not to say Enforcers must be squeaky clean, with infractions often able to be overlooked by bribing a contact within your organization. <br /><br /><h3>Criminals    </h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1750/1329648-yodawg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1329648" data-size="medium" style="width: 419px" data-ratio="2.0286396181384" data-width="419" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:202.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1750/1329648-yodawg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1329648"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1750/1329648-yodawg.jpg"></a><figcaption>  He dares you to try spotting all of his stereotypical clichés.  </figcaption></figure>     Thug, gang-banger or just an all round bad guy. Whatever you call them, Criminals are motivated by two things - money and power. Not unlike their badged counterparts, wannabe <a data-ref-id="3030-10261" href="/bad-dudes/3030-10261">                                                                   bad dudes</a> are able to join one of the two major criminal organizations (aka <a data-ref-id="3015-1397" href="/gangs/3015-1397">                                                                    gangs</a>) in San-Paro, the Blood Roses or the G-Kings. <br /> <br />Once under the wing of their chosen gang, budding criminals are able to bring death and destruction to San-Paro by picking up missions and bounties from gang leaders or simply by causing indiscriminate chaos on the streets. This type of activity doesn't stay unopposed for long however, as patrolling enforcers are able to report any witnessed criminal activity resulting in the immediate dispatch of other rank-matched enforcers.  <br /> <h2>Location</h2> <p style="">Set in the fictional west-coast metropolis of San  Paro, APB divides the city into three distinct districts. Two of which,  the Financial District and the Waterfront District serve as the main  staging areas for APB’s combat heavy gameplay, while the Social District  focuses on friends, clans and customization as well as having an  increased population cap.  <br /></p><table class="t-editor full-width with-out-border"><tbody><tr><td><h3>Financial District </h3> <figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1750/1330981-official_20090914_1272921200.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1330981" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.56153846153846" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1750/1330981-official_20090914_1272921200.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1330981"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1750/1330981-official_20090914_1272921200.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1750/1330981-official_20090914_1272921200.jpg"></noscript></a></figure> With its numerous  skyscrapers and narrow alleyways, the Financial  District encourages  players to leave their vehicles behind and take to  the streets to engage  in intense fire fights. The types of missions  players can expect to  experience include bomb planting/defusing,  graffiti tagging/clean-up and  evidence gathering/destroying. Financial  District instances currently  have a population cap of 100 and occupy  the space of roughly 40 city  blocks.  <br /></td></tr><tr><td><h3>Waterfront District </h3> <figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1750/1330984-pcg208.feat_apb.gen10__article_image.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1330984" data-size="medium" style="width: 418px" data-ratio="0.5622009569378" data-width="418" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1750/1330984-pcg208.feat_apb.gen10__article_image.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1330984"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1750/1330984-pcg208.feat_apb.gen10__article_image.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1750/1330984-pcg208.feat_apb.gen10__article_image.jpg"></noscript></a></figure> While similar in  size and scope to the Financial district (roughly 40  city blocks and a  population cap of 100), the Waterfront Distinct  carries its own unique  look and feel. With wide roads and a coastline  that stretches the entire  length of the map, car chases and massive  shootouts become a much more  common sight.

All  Social District instances have an increased  population cap of 250  however the map size is significantly smaller due  to the absence of  vehicles. The district also acts as a way to reward  the best players by  displaying posters and billboards featuring their  character. Other  mechanics unique to the Social District include  jukeboxes that play  custom music to all players in its immediate  vicinity and cinemas  screening mission replays. <br /></td></tr></tbody></table> <br /><h2>Customization <br /></h2>As one of the most heavily promoted aspects of the game, APB features an array of utilities that allow for the in-game customization of your character, vehicles and even music.    <br /><br /><table class="t-editor full-width with-out-border"><tbody><tr><td><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1750/1330985-ss_preview_6.jpg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1330985" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.8" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1750/1330985-ss_preview_6.jpg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1330985"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1750/1330985-ss_preview_6.jpg.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1750/1330985-ss_preview_6.jpg.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Character  Creator </figcaption></figure><h3>Character <br /></h3>        Similar to most other MMO's, APB allows  the player to choose their initial physical appearance such as gender,  race and hair style.

In addition to standard group voice chat functionality, Realtime Worlds also implemented 3D positional voice chat that accounts for position of the speaker and relative distance.  <br /> <br /><h3>Controversy<br /></h3>Realtime Worlds implemented a controversial audio advertising system in APB for VoIP users. Under the default VoIP plan, players will hear a five to fifteen second audio advertisement while switching between districts. According to Realtime Worlds, the ads will play no more than once every three hours.    <br /> <br />Users can also choose to completely disable audio advertisements by purchasing VoIP premium passes that remove all audio advertisements for 30, 60, 90, or 180 days in exchange for a fee. <br /><br /><h2>Payment Models <br /></h2>Included with the game is unlimited access to the Social District and 50 hours of playtime in the action districts (Financial and Waterfront). Once the 50 hours is up, players can choose between three different payment methods. <br /> <br /><table class="t-editor full-width with-out-border"><tbody><tr><th>Unlimited Access<br /></th><th>Pay-As-You-Go</th><th>RTW Points<br /></th></tr><tr><td><ul class="plain-list"><li>Unlimited gameplay for 30 days</li><li>Pay monthly ($9.99/£7.99/€8.99)</li></ul></td><td><ul class="plain-list"><li>20 Hours of game time (never expires) in the action districts<br /></li><li>$6.99/£5.59/€6.29</li></ul></td><td><ul class="plain-list"><li>Exchange in-game currency for gameplay time </li><li>Earn points only by selling your creations on the market place to other players</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><br />Regardless of payment method, players will always have access to the Social District (even when their game time expires).  <br /><br /><h2>System Requirements</h2> <i>These are based on requirements for beta testing, noted as of 24th February 2010.</i><br /><table class="t-editor full-width with-out-border"><tbody><tr><th>Minimum</th><th>Recommended<br /></th></tr><tr><td><ul class="plain-list"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows XP</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Core 2 Duo 2.13 GHz or equivalent</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2GM RAM</li><li><strong>Video:</strong> NVidia GeForce 7800 256MB</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong> 15GB</li><li><strong>Sound:</strong> DirectX 9</li><li><strong>Internet:</strong> Broadband connection required to install and play    </li></ul> </td><td><ul class="plain-list"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows Vista / Windows 7 (recommend a 64-bit operating system)</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 2.4GHz Intel Core 2 Quad or equivalent</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4GB RAM</li><li><strong>Video:</strong> NVidia GeForce 8800 GTX 512MB or equivalent</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong> 15GB</li><li><strong>Sound:</strong> DirectX 9</li><li><strong>Internet:</strong> Broadband connection required to install and play    </li></ul> </td></tr></tbody></table> <br /><h2>Soundtrack <br /></h2>APB sports over a 160 song soundtrack list.  <br /><br /><ul class="plain-list"><li>Mad World -  <b>Tears for Fears</b></li><li>Favourite Jeans -  <b>Bertie Blackman</b></li><li>Rational Gaze -  <b>Meshuggah</b></li><li>Beautiful Tomorrow -  <b>Beth Rowley</b></li><li>Riot Act -  <b>Exodus</b></li><li>Johnny Got A Boom Boom -  <b>Imelda May</b></li><li>Heat -  <b>Recordkingz</b></li><li>So Fine -  <b>Telepathe</b></li><li>Death -  <b>White Lies</b></li><li>Zero -  <b>Yeah Yeah Yeahs</b></li><li>Courage -  <b>Alien Ant Farm</b></li><li>Gimme That Punk -  <b>Audio Bullys</b></li><li>Lava Lava -  <b>Boys Noize</b></li><li>Mercury -  <b>Clutch</b></li><li>Progenies of the Great Apocalypse -  <b>Dimmu Borgir</b></li><li>Central Park -  <b>Division of Laura Lee</b></li><li>Bright Lights -  <b>The Ghost of A Thousand</b></li><li>Come Clarity -  <b>In Flames </b></li><li>Hermaploitation 74 -  <b>Herma Puma</b></li><li>The Shape Of Punk To Come -  <b>Refus</b></li><li>Under The Knife -  <b>Rise Against</b></li><li>John Q Public -  <b>Anomie Belle </b></li><li>The Truth -  <b>Bulletproof Messenger</b></li><li>Fang -  <b>Druu</b> </li><li>Silhouette -  <b>Fono</b> </li><li>Battle Front -  <b>Rareform</b></li><li>Zookeeper -  <b>Honey Claws</b></li><li>Brotherhood of the Drum -  <b>KJ Sawka</b></li><li>Children Of Neon Lights -  <b>La Fleur Fatale</b></li><li>Hawk Eyes -  <b>Leopold And His Fiction </b></li><li>Viva La Revolucion -  <b>Love in October</b></li><li>A Lot Of Us (Feat.

Barely 2 months after release (2 months and 17 days)   Ben 'APBMonkey' Bateman posted the below message. The forums were also shut down at this time. <blockquote><p style="">"APB has been a fantastic journey, but unfortunately that journey has come to a premature end. Today we are sad to announce that despite everyone's best efforts to keep the service running; APB is coming to a close. It's been a pleasure working on APB and with all its players. Together we were building an absolutely amazing game, and for that, we thank you. You guys are awesome!</p>From all of the Realtime World staff we thank you for your continued support."       </blockquote>Gamersfirst, a free-to-play MMO company, subsequently acquired and relaunched APB as a free-to-play MMO.  It was renamed APB Reloaded.<br /><h2>Intellectual Property Sale</h2>The BBC <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-11333582" rel="nofollow">        reported </a>that the APB administrators were looking to sell the intellectual property rights due to the game's closure. One potential buyer was <a data-ref-id="3010-149" href="/epic-games/3010-149">    Epic Games</a>. It was speculated that Epic would have a less difficult time getting APB up and running again because the game uses Epic's <a data-ref-id="3015-86" href="/unreal-engine-3/3015-86">   Unreal Engine</a>. Epic's spokesperson <a data-ref-id="3040-79471" href="/dana-cowley/3040-79471">  Dana Cowley</a> did not comment directly on that issue. However, she did say, "<a data-ref-id="3040-6850" href="/mark-a-rein/3040-6850"> Mark (Rein)</a> absolutely loves APB, and everyone here loved what they saw."     <br /> <br /><h2>Compensation <br /></h2>After the closure of APB, EA offered compensation to the people who invested money in APB. This allowed people (who could prove they had bought the game) to pick something from the EA store of equal value, including:<br /><ul class="plain-list"><li><a data-ref-id="3030-25246" href="/battlefield-bad-company-2/3030-25246">        Bad Company 2 </a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3030-14139" href="/spore/3030-14139">        Spore </a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3025-1609" href="/dragon-age/3025-1609">        Dragon Age</a> </li><li><a data-ref-id="3030-17463" href="/the-sims/3030-17463">        The Sims </a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3030-26702" href="/fifa-10/3030-26702">        Fifa 10</a></li></ul>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>20985</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/0/6247/1422518-926499_62895_front.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/6247/1422518-926499_62895_front.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/0/6247/1422518-926499_62895_front.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6247/1422518-926499_62895_front.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/6247/1422518-926499_62895_front.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/6247/1422518-926499_62895_front.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/0/6247/1422518-926499_62895_front.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[APB Reloaded]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>5</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-37/]]></api_detail_url><id>37</id><name><![CDATA[PEGI: 18+]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-16/]]></api_detail_url><id>16</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: M]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2010-06-29 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-145/]]></api_detail_url><id>145</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox One]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-one/3045-145/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[XONE]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/]]></api_detail_url><id>146</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 4]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS4]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/apb-reloaded/3030-20985/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[FF Versus XIII

Originally revealed as a <a href="/playstation-3/3045-35" data-ref-id="3045-35">PlayStation 3</a> exclusive entitled Final Fantasy Versus XIII, it was later re-announced during <a href="/e3-2013/3015-7534" data-ref-id="3015-7534">E3 2013</a> that its name had changed, and it had become the next game in the core <a href="/final-fantasy/3025-194" data-ref-id="3025-194">Final Fantasy</a> franchise. It will be released on both the <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146" data-ref-id="3045-146">PlayStation 4</a> and <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/xbox-one/3045-145" data-ref-id="3045-145">Xbox One</a>.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p style="">The story revolves around a prince, <a href="/noctis-lucis-caelum/3005-8162" data-ref-id="3005-8162">Noctis Lucis Caelum</a>, who is the heir to the throne of the Kingdom of Lucis. Lucis has become more modernized than other nations, to the point where it resembles a contemporary city of modern Earth<i>.</i> It has isolated itself from the world in the process. The game's setting involves a war between Lucis and another nation called Niflheim as they fight for control of the world's last crystal, which Lucis possesses. The game begins after the end of a long cold war between warring nations and the world's crystals are involved in these conflicts in some way.</p><h2>Characters</h2><h3>Noctis</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56735/2502917-final+fantasy+xv.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2502917" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="1.413" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:141.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56735/2502917-final+fantasy+xv.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2502917"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/5/56735/2502917-final+fantasy+xv.jpg"></a><figcaption>Noctis and his crew. From left to right: Prompto, Gladiolus, Noctis, Ignis, and Cor.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Noctis is the last heir to the throne of a dynasty who are in charge of protecting the last crystal, and he has to protect the city from an enemy nation trying to steal the crystal. He is able to wield multiple swords, spears, and lances by materializing them out of thin air and controlling them with telekinesis. His weapons can also be used as shields. Noctis also has the ability to teleport and move at high speeds. His eyes change color from blue to red during battle, which is related to his teleportation ability.</p><h3>Noctis's Party</h3><p style="">Most of Noctis's party consists of his childhood friends: Ignis Stupeo Scientia, a strategist for the royal family who fights with a katana, Gladiolus Amicitia, a bodyguard of the royal family who fights bare-handed and with a giant greatsword, and Prompto Argentum, a foreign fugitive who wields firearms, despite their illegal status in Lucis. There is also Cor Leonis, a middle-aged military man who is sworn to serve Noctis and his father.</p><h3>Stella</h3><p style="">Noctis finds a counterpart in Stella Nox Fleuret, who is implied to be royalty like him, though from another nation. Just like Noctis, Stella is shown to be able to fight by materializing weapons out of thin air. Noctis and Stella seem reluctant to fight each other and her exact affiliation with him is unknown. The two of them talk about how they are both able to "see the light", implying that they have similar powers. Noctis is shy but hides it by acting cool, while Stella seems to have had a much better upbringing.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Combat</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/99864/2507753-7717677859-FFXV_.png" data-ref-id="1300-2507753" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/99864/2507753-7717677859-FFXV_.png" data-ref-id="1300-2507753"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/9/99864/2507753-7717677859-FFXV_.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/9/99864/2507753-7717677859-FFXV_.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Gladiolus shields Noctis from an enemy monster</figcaption></figure><p style="">The player has direct control over one character, Noctis, with assistance from AI companion party members. Party members can also team up for more powerful attacks.</p><p style="">In early iterations of the game, the game would <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/party-leader-dies-game-over/3015-6548" data-ref-id="3015-6548">end immediately if Noctis died in battle</a>, though that may change for the final version.</p><h3>Transportation</h3><p style="">The primary mode of travel around the game's world is a car. Though the player can exit the car and explore the world on foot, the world is large enough enough foot travel between destinations isn't practical. The player is able to drive the car manually, or set driving to auto. When driving is being directed by the game, the player can still look around the world as it passes by for secrets.</p><h3>Teleportation Power</h3><p style="">Noctis has a special teleportation ability that allows him to warp between select points in the environment. When a cursor highlights a visible location that Noctis can warp to, the player can make him teleport to that spot.</p><h2>Development</h2><p style="">Final Fantasy XV was first announced under the name of Final Fantasy Versus XIII in 2006. Helmed by <a href="/tetsuya-nomura/3040-637" data-ref-id="3040-637">Tetsuya Nomura</a>, the intent was to create an <a href="/action-rpg/3015-8592" data-ref-id="3015-8592">action RPG</a> in the vein of <a href="/kingdom-hearts/3025-414" data-ref-id="3025-414">Kingdom Hearts</a>, but with a more mature tone and story. The game's title "Versus XIII" was meant to reference a number of elements, such as the game's darker tone and setting that play in opposition to the tone and setting of <a href="/final-fantasy-xiii/3030-20664" data-ref-id="3030-20664">Final Fantasy XIII</a>. Versus XIII was developed as a part of the <a href="/fabula-nova-crystallis/3025-612" data-ref-id="3025-612">Fabula Nova Crystallis</a> project, along with Final Fantasy XIII and <a href="/final-fantasy-type-0/3030-21848" data-ref-id="3030-21848">Final Fantasy Type-0</a> (originally entitled Final Fantasy Agito XIII), and shares elements of the same fictional mythology from which the other games take their own.</p><p style="">After years of protracted development, Square Enix unveiled a new trailer for Versus XIII at <a href="/e3-2013/3015-7534" data-ref-id="3015-7534">E3 2013</a>, where it was first revealed that the game had become Final Fantasy XV. The following year, at <a href="/tokyo-game-show-2014/3015-8511" data-ref-id="3015-8511">TGS 2014</a>, Square Enix announced that Nomura had shifted off of the project to focus on <a href="/kingdom-hearts-iii/3030-42926" data-ref-id="3030-42926">Kingdom Hearts III</a>, and that Final Fantasy Type-0 director <a href="/hajime-tabata/3040-94186" data-ref-id="3040-94186">Hajime Tabata</a> is now overseeing the game's development. Tabata originally joined the Final Fantasy XV team as co-director in 2012, after which the game began its transition from Versus XIII to XV and development was moved to newer console platforms. Additionally, the three core gameplay, engine, and cinematics teams that had been working separately on Versus XIII, were merged for better collaboration. As of TGS 2014, the Final Fantasy XV team was around three hundred people.</p><h3>Luminous Studio Engine</h3><p style="">The game is running on Square Enix's <a href="/luminous-engine/3015-7696" data-ref-id="3015-7696">Luminous Studio</a> graphics engine. The demo will be using version 1.5 of the engine, while the final game will be using version 2.0 of the engine. It will be running at 1080p with 30 frames per second. Compared to the 20,000 polygons used for the <a href="/fabula-nova-crystallis/3025-612" data-ref-id="3025-612">Final Fantasy XIII</a> characters, Final Fantasy XV will be using 100,000 polygons for its characters (around the same as <a href="/the-order-1886/3030-42922" data-ref-id="3030-42922">The Order: 1886</a>, <a href="/uncharted-4-a-thiefs-end/3030-44507" data-ref-id="3030-44507">Uncharted 4</a>, and <a href="/star-citizen/3030-40011" data-ref-id="3030-40011">Star Citizen</a>, but slightly less than <a href="/ninja-gaiden-3-razors-edge/3030-39749" data-ref-id="3030-39749">Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge</a> and <a href="/infamous-second-son/3030-41695" data-ref-id="3030-41695">inFamous: Second Son</a>). Overall, Final Fantasy XV will be using 5 million polygons per frame, pushing 150 million polygons per second.

The developers are aiming to allow the demo to be completed in an hour, but it could contain enough optional content to explore to extend to three hours.</p><h2>Useful Links</h2><ul><li><a href="http://www.jp.square-enix.com/ff15/" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">Official Final Fantasy XV Website (Japan)</a></li><li><a href="http://archive.na.square-enix.com/FFXV/" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">Official Final Fantasy XV Website (North America and Europe)</a></li></ul>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year>2016</expected_release_year><id>21006</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/18/187968/2750705-rsz_2image.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/18/187968/2750705-rsz_2image.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/18/187968/2750705-rsz_2image.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/18/187968/2750705-rsz_2image.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/18/187968/2750705-rsz_2image.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/18/187968/2750705-rsz_2image.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/18/187968/2750705-rsz_2image.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XV]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating/><original_release_date/><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-145/]]></api_detail_url><id>145</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox One]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-one/3045-145/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[XONE]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/]]></api_detail_url><id>146</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 4]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS4]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/final-fantasy-xv/3030-21006/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[DCUO]]></aliases><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21110/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-07-15 16:39:03</date_added><date_last_updated>2016-01-11 19:08:33</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[An MMO for the PC and PlayStation 3 that allows you to fight for and alongside the forces of good or evil from the DC Comics Universe.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">DC Universe Online was announced at Sony's <a href="../../e3-2008/92-3499/" rel="nofollow">E3 2008</a> press conference. It is an MMORPG in which you create your own superhero and roam the streets of well known DC Comics locations, including <a href="../../gotham-city/95-111/" rel="nofollow">Gotham Cit</a>y and <a href="../../metropolis/95-114/" rel="nofollow">Metropolis</a>. World renowned comic book artist <a href="../../jim-lee/72-89281/" rel="nofollow">Jim Lee</a> was the one who unveiled the game and is involved heavily in the development process. In the game you will be able to fight along side famous DC heroes and villains such as <a href="/batman/3005-66" data-ref-id="3005-66">Batman</a>, <a href="/superman/3005-47" data-ref-id="3005-47">Superman</a> and <a href="/wonder-woman/3005-2301" data-ref-id="3005-2301">Wonder Woman</a>, <a href="/lex-luthor/3005-6225" data-ref-id="3005-6225">Lex Luthor</a>, <a href="/circe/3005-9864" data-ref-id="3005-9864">Circe</a> and the <a href="/the-joker/3005-952" data-ref-id="3005-952">Joker</a> and enter well known comic book locations.

However, his success was thanks largely to the machinations of Braniac, who had slowly been draining Earth's protectors of their powers, and eventually conquers all of Earth.</p><p style="">Future Lex time-travels to the present, and tells the still intact Justice League the fate of their planet, and his plan to avert it: by releasing nanites created from the powers of the heroes in the future by Braniac. Future Lex infects much of the population of Earth with new superpowers to swell the ranks of meta-humans for the coming Brainiac invasion.</p><p style="">As one of the new superheroes (or villains), you escape Brainiac's harvester ships with the help of either Oracle and Superman or Calculator and Lex Luthor, and go on to be mentored in the ways of justice or evil.</p><p style="">If you choose to be a hero, your mentor will be either Superman, Wonder Woman, or Batman. For the villain side, your mentor will be Lex Luthor, Circe, or the Joker. You will also begin the game in your mentor's respective home turf (eg Metropolis if Superman or Lex), where the battle between good and evil, heightened by the influx of new Metas, rages on every street corner.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2748/272615-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-272615" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2748/272615-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-272615"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2748/272615-2.jpg"></a><figcaption>Not only can objects be thrown and used as melee weapons, but also they can be charged up and even deflected.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The gameplay is more action oriented than most MMORPGs. You begin with selecting your character's customized stats and look. You can then choose your super power like fire, lightning, etc. You can then chose your power source (for example your fists if it's a Batman-like character or a bow and arrow for a Green Arrow type character) and your movement style like super speed, flight, acrobatics, etc. Combined with traits like super strength or metabolism, you can mix and match many of these gameplay choices and create any type of superhero you want (weapons are also available for your character but are based on whether they are ranged or close-quarter combat items). You get different abilities as you level up like in most traditional MMORPGs (the two types of points that you invest in your character's abilities are skill points and power points). The more you invest towards your hero/villain's skill will cause the effectiveness of that skill to increase (telekinesis for example has a greater range and damage as it is upgraded). Depending on the skills you have, you can climb walls, run fast, jump really high, etc. There are no classes in the game because every aspect of the character is customizable and because superheroes are very adaptable (in the game you can change from an offensive role to defensive role on the fly, affecting the abilities you have). One ability might be used to deal damage but when switched to defensive mode that power is used to knock opponents down.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/899387-dc_scr_env_metro_0041.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-899387" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.5634765625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/899387-dc_scr_env_metro_0041.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-899387"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/19745/899387-dc_scr_env_metro_0041.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/19745/899387-dc_scr_env_metro_0041.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Places from the DC Universe, like Metropolis, will be fully explorable right down to the Daily Planet.</figcaption></figure><p style="">It seems that instead of the traditional "Quests" you have "cases". This is where you must provide a wide range of help to the other legendary superheroes like Superman or Batman. For example, Batman may call you on your communicator to meet him at the docks for help. Also, he will be disappointed and make a remark pertaining to your absence if you didn't show up. You will have a relationship with these characters and they will respond accordingly to your actions and choices. Another example of a case would be that you arrive in Metropolis, one of the fully fleshed and explorable cities/areas in the game, where you must prevent Doomsday from escaping after a huge fight with Superman. Your case would be to stop Lex Luthor's forces from obtaining some of the blood that spilled during the battle. You will be in contact with these superheroes throughout your career. If you play as the villain you will get "Capers" where you work for the villians. So you will actually be fighting other players who are working for the superheroes on the same mission objectives.</p><p style="">The action is not turn based or random; it's all 100% responsive to your button commands like a standard action game.</p><p style="">There is no death in the game, just Knockouts. Instead you can choose to rally back into the fight or withdraw. You can revive unconscious NPCs and other players so that they can help you if and/or when the need arises.</p><h3>Powers</h3><p style="">Players are given the option to setup the powers of their superhero during the initial creation of their character. Powers basically determine what kind of combat abilities they will have and their specific role type. Within each powers skill tree, players have two paths to allocate their points. Powers are currently broken up into:</p><p style=""><b><u>Fire</u></b></p><ul><li>Immolation</li><li>Ignition</li></ul><p style=""><b><u>Ice</u></b></p><ul><li>Cryogenics</li><li>Storm</li></ul><p style=""><b><u>Mental</u></b></p><ul><li>Telekinesis</li><li>Illusion</li></ul><p style=""><b><u>Nature</u></b></p><ul><li>Shape shifting</li><li>Plants</li></ul><p style=""><b><u>Sorcery</u></b></p><ul><li>Summoning</li><li>Destiny</li></ul><p style=""><b><u>Gadgets</u></b></p><ul><li>Tricks</li><li>Traps</li></ul><p style=""><b><u>Light</u></b></p><ul><li>Support</li><li>Assault</li></ul><p style=""><b><u>Electricity</u></b></p><ul><li>Voltage</li><li>Amperage</li></ul><p style=""><b><u>Earth</u></b></p><ul><li>Geokinesis</li><li>Seismic</li></ul><p style=""><b><u>Quantum</u></b></p><ul><li>Time</li><li>Space</li></ul><h3>Weapons</h3><p style="">Weapons determine your basic form of combat. Depending on what type of weapons you choose will determine if your character deals damage up close or from a far. At first players are only allowed to choose one type of weapon skill to learn but after they reach level 10 they can choose from the others available.</p><p style="">At the moment the weapon types are:</p><ul><li>One-Handed</li><li>Two-Handed</li><li>Hand Blaster</li><li>Bow</li><li>Brawling</li><li>Dual Pistols</li><li>Dual Wield</li><li>Martial Arts</li><li>Rifle</li><li>Staff</li></ul><h2>Pricing</h2><p style="">The <a href="../../playstation-3/60-35/" rel="nofollow">PS3</a> version of the game originally retailed for $59.99 while the <a href="../../pc/60-94/" rel="nofollow">PC</a> version originally retailed for $49.99. Both versions come with one free month of play time. The game originally followed the standard a $15/month subscription-based model until October 2011 when a free-to-play model was unveiled. There are three "tiers:" Free, Premium and Legendary. The Legendary subscription will retain the $15 a month fee but grants all current and future DLC at no additional cost, more than 15 character slots, more than 80 inventory slots, the ability to form leagues without any size restrictions, and more.</p><h2>DLC Packs</h2><h3>Fight for the Light</h3><p style="">The first DLC pack released on September 6, 2011.

Much like its spiritual predecessor <a data-ref-id="3030-15849" href="/flow/3030-15849">flOw</a>, flower is much less about the gameplay than it is about a different meaning of a game.</p><p style="">thatgamecompany's co-founder, <a data-ref-id="3040-82903" href="/jenova-chen/3040-82903">Jenova Chen</a>, has described it as being like "video game poetry." It is not too difficult to interpret there being an environmental message behind the game, or at least a contrast to urban living being explored. Bringing unique elements yet to be seen in this generation of consoles, flower has gained a dedicated following.</p><h3>Inspiration</h3><p style="">In <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9y6MYDSAww" rel="nofollow">a TED talk about "Are Video Games Art?"</a>, <a data-ref-id="3040-98025" href="/kellee-santiago/3040-98025">Kellee Santiago</a> of <a data-ref-id="3010-5521" href="/thatgamecompany/3010-5521">thatgamecompany</a>, said the game was "<strong>an expression of director,</strong> <a data-ref-id="3040-82903" href="/jenova-chen/3040-82903"><strong>Jenova Chen</strong></a><strong>, who moved from the extremely metropolitan area of Shanghai, China to the relatively more rural area of California. He was just amazed at these huge rolling landscapes, and yet he found over time, he started to miss those elements of the city he grew up with. And so although it starts in these very open, clean environments; as the player goes through the game, they realise it's about trying to find a harmony or balance between the elements of urban and the natural</strong>."</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">Essentially, the player controls the wind. The gameplay involves guiding a stream of petals around various landscapes in which you will be able to interact with the flowers there in some way, depending on the particular level. All motion in the game is designed to be controlled using the SIXAXIS functionality of the <a data-ref-id="3045-35" href="/playstation-3/3045-35">PlayStation 3</a> controller. The creators are trying to immerse the player in another experience when playing flower, which they are trying to achieve by the use of stunning visuals complemented by a soothing musical score, and with the field of vision in the game being wider than in most games to better mimic a human's peripheral vision and depth perception. The visual fidelity of Flower is in large part due to the game being able to render and simulate 200,000 blades of grass on-screen at any one time, surely allowing it to claim the coveted boast of the 'best grass in video games...ever'. The only use of the buttons in gameplay is holding any button to accelerate.</p><h3>Hidden/Secret Flowers</h3><p style="">Each level contains three groups of secret flowers, some of which are activated by blooming certain flowers in a particular area and others are hidden from the path the game leads you through. Each batch collected leaves a seed in the pot of your flower in the menu upon completion of the level. Each seed you collect will also make your flower at the menu open up to a more full bloom. Obtaining all three secret flower groups for all six levels will grant you the Dream gold trophy, which will also change the default view from the apartment, this view replaces the urban environment with a sunny field in the foreground and a grassy hill in the background. This is thought to show that the flowers' dream has come true.</p><h2>Level design</h2><p style="">It would seem that the main menu in flower, from which each level is loaded, is based around an urban apartment. The different levels are said to be the 'dreams' of different flowers that are represented in this apartment. The flowers appear in the following order when all the levels are unlocked: Pink, Red, Yellow, Blue, Purple, White. Every single flower level adds something unique or introduces a new type of flower.</p><h3>Pink Flower</h3><p style="">Gazing into this flower opens a wind based level. Players are introduced to the blue flowers which make wind blow to power up the many windmills. Afterwords player traverse a canyon until they gain more speed and end up powering more windmills.</p><h3>Red Flower</h3><p style="">This is the second level you unlock. It is a color based level that starts in sepia tones. When you unleash the power of the red flowers color starts popping into the world. In the final area you can gain the power to color grass by touching different stones.</p><h3>Yellow Flower</h3><p style="">The first level focuses on introducing the basic flower mechanics. Grabbing yellow flowers makes red flowers spawn, and red flowers renew and reinvigorate the area around them turning it green and filled with life.</p><h3>Blue Flower</h3><p style="">Using windmills to create electricity and illuminate the ground at nighttime is the new mechanic presented here. Here you are able to "charge" electrically the petals that follow you and transmit electricity from lamp post to lamp post until you finish the level.</p><h3>Purple Flower</h3><p style="">The dreariest level in the game, you must reach the end while nullifying the threatening electrical power grids, that can burn you and hurt you. Culminates with a dash and dodging of falling debris and is apparently directly connected to the final level.</p><h3>White Flower</h3><p style="">This is the final level, the new mechanic introduced is renovating the world, at the beginning the petals become super charged similar to when you could color the grass in the red color level. You now have the power to eliminate the corruption in the city, and renovate it and repaint it into a vibrant and beautiful place once more.</p><p style="">Each dream/level is based on an aspect of urban life with flower presumably showing a contrast to that within the level. So, for example, one level will be based on color, with the game world initially starting out as desaturated and gray like in most urban landscapes, but with progressively more color coming into the landscape as you interact with it. There are six levels in total, plus the credits level.</p><h2>Awards</h2><p style="">In addition to being critically well received, flower won numerous awards including</p><ul><li>Best Indie Game - Playboy</li><li>Best Original Soundtrack - X-Play</li><li>Best Independent Game of the Year - SpikeTV Video Game Awards</li><li>Best Downloadable Game of the Year - TheSixthAxis</li><li>Download Game of the Year - 1UP</li><li><a data-ref-id="3015-3244" href="/e3-2009/3015-3244">E3</a> Gold Award - <a data-ref-id="3010-3694" href="/gamepro/3010-3694">GamePro</a></li><li>Best Downloadable Game - GameSpy</li><li>PS3 Special Achievement for Innovation - IGN</li><li>Best Original Game - UGO</li><li>Casual Game of the Year - AIAS</li><li>Oh, and <a data-ref-id="3040-44184" href="/david-jaffe/3040-44184">David Jaffe</a> called flower his Game of the Year.

In addition to the cranes, the Origami Killer also covers their victim's faces with mud and leaves an orchid on their chest. All of the victims had been drowned before the killer moved the bodies. Players control four main characters to investigate and figure out who is committing these atrocities.</p><h3>Norman Jayden</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/1034379-06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1034379" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/1034379-06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1034379"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14036/1034379-06.jpg"></a><figcaption>Norman Jayden</figcaption></figure><p style=""><a href="../../norman-jayden/94-11660/" rel="nofollow">Norman Jayden</a> is a criminal profiler for the <a href="../../agents/92-2906/" rel="nofollow">FBI</a> with additional expertise in the forensics field. He is sent to help the local police by doing a profile of the Origami Killer, but soon starts investigating the cases on his own using the hi-tech gadget ARI (Added Reality Interface) - much to the chagrin of several members of the local PD who do not like him interfering with their business. In the demo of Heavy Rain, Norman investigates a murder scene at a railway line. His investigation leads him to believe that the body was dumped by the Origami Killer. Jayden is addicted to the fictional drug Triptocaine, which plays a significant role in his part of the game. He experiences many symptoms (severe tremors, dizziness and nosebleeds) that are assumed to be related to withdrawal, but the game never really clarifies what they are from.</p><h3>Ethan Mars</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/1110366-screen003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1110366" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/1110366-screen003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1110366"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14036/1110366-screen003.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14036/1110366-screen003.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ethan Mars</figcaption></figure><p style=""><a href="../../ethan-mars/94-12115/" rel="nofollow">Ethan Mars</a> is a happily married architect and father of two sons, Jason and Shaun.

The player often has direct control of the character, and can walk around at will within a set area using the R2 Button and Left Analog Stick. There are almost no <a href="../../in-engine-cinematic/92-964/" rel="nofollow">cinematics</a> to watch. There is an investigation portion to the game - mainly when <a href="../../norman-jayden/94-11660/" rel="nofollow">Jayden</a> uses ARI at crime scenes - where the player can freely search anywhere they think they might find a hidden clue. There is another portion of the game that uses <a href="../../quick-time-event/92-6/" rel="nofollow">QTE</a>s, mostly during fast paced action sequences, to create immersion. The QTEs, however, are not static images prompting button presses, but rather are worked into the environment. At times, multiple buttons will appear on screen allowing you to choose from a number of events whose outcome is felt immediately. The <a href="">QTE</a>s use every button on the PS3 controller (except L3, R3, the D-pad and obviously the Start and Select buttons) as well as its <a href="/sixaxis-support/3015-5310" data-ref-id="3015-5310">SIXAXIS</a> functionality. At certain points in the game, the player is required to press a succession of buttons, holding down the previous button(s) as they press the next - these combinations are often constructed in such a way that the difficulty of what the character is trying to achieve corresponds with the physical difficulty of pressing the correct buttons (meaning that a QTE for crawling through live electricity will be much harder than a QTE for going up a hill).</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14036/1034381-07.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1034381" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14036/1034381-07.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1034381"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14036/1034381-07.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14036/1034381-07.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>"Can you stop that thing?"</figcaption></figure><p style=""><a href="../../dialogue-trees/92-77/" rel="nofollow">Dialogue trees</a> are used heavily in the games, represented by words encircling the player. The state of the words will correspond to the character's mental state - if they are in a state of panic the words can be shaking violently, making them difficult to read. The same applies to the 'thought mechanic' where by pressing L2 at any time, a 'dialogue tree' will show what thoughts are going through that character's mind.</p><p style="">There is no <a href="../../game-over/92-372/" rel="nofollow">game over</a> screen, as the game continues to take into account whatever actions occur regardless of how drastically they affect the characters. If a character you control dies, then he or she will remain dead and the investigation will continue from another character's perspective. If all characters die, the plot line will still continue without the impact that those characters could have made.</p><h2>Development</h2><p style="">Development of Heavy Rain began in February of 2006 and was announced at <a href="../../e3-2006/92-3439/" rel="nofollow">E3</a> <a href="../../e3-2006/92-3439/" rel="nofollow">2006</a>, at which it was a tech demo called "The Casting". The game was originally for PC and there were to be two separate releases of the game - one for computers equipped with the appropriate physics processing unit and one for computers that didn't meet the specification. Some of the physics relied on <a href="../../physx/92-1923/" rel="nofollow">PhysX</a>. The E3 demo made use of <a href="../../ageia-technologies-inc/65-4701/" rel="nofollow">AGEIA</a> technology.</p><p style="">Noteworthy features of "The Casting" were full body motion capture along with full facial motion capture, wrinkles on faces, real time tears, advanced rendering features, and advanced skin shaders. The demo showed technology enabling pupil dilation and dynamic hair with physics. The game engine supports full real time post-processing. The facial motion capture was captured using a Vicon MX40 camera with an enhanced muscle system.</p><h2>Deleted Content</h2><p style="">During the game's development, the story had many supernatural elements. Scott and Ethan were supposed to share a mental bond that caused Ethan's blackout. Scott was also seen smothering his mother with a pillow. However, these were cut from the final version because they were not deemed suitable.</p><h2>Heavy Rain Chronicles - DLC</h2><p style="">Quantic Dream founder David Cage said 2009 in an Interview with VideoGamer.com that "<i>.. we are talking with Sony at the moment about having maybe extra downloadable content, maybe with prequels or sequels about the characters.</i>"</p><p style="">Later it was revealed that the DLC would be episodes of the so-called Heavy Rain Chronicles.</p><p style=""><u><b>Different Plans for DLC, revealed during various Interviews:</b></u></p><p style="">- <a href="">The Taxidermist</a> (at first only available with a preorder code, later through PSN purchase - released on April 1, 2010)</p><p style="">- DLC with a focus on Norman Jayden and how he got addicted to drugs;</p><p style="">- Another episode with you taking the role of the "villain";</p><p style="">On July 2010 Cage revealed in an Interview with Eurogamer.com on subject of the Chronicles that "<i>.. they are on hold to allow the team to work on Move and on new projects, and I doubt they will ever be produced.</i>"</p><h2>PlayStation Move Version</h2><p style="">In Winter 2010, a new version of the game was released, Heavy Rain Move Edition. This version of the game integrates the <a href="/playstation-move/3000-36" data-ref-id="3000-36">PlayStation Move</a> controller into the game, allowing full motion control of the characters' actions. Older versions of the game can be patched with a free download to integrate these Move controls. Heavy Rain Move Edition is fully playable with standard controller.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p style=""><b>Heavy Rain</b>'s soundtrack was composed by <a href="/normand-corbeil/3040-98308" data-ref-id="3040-98308">Normand Corbeil</a> and recorded at the Abbey Road Studios in London. It was made available on the iTunes Store on 23 February, 2010 and on the PlayStation Network on 4 March, 2010.</p><ol><li>Ethan Mars' Main Theme (3:31)</li><li>Norman Jayden's Main Theme (4:42)</li><li>Before the Storm (2:55)</li><li>Madison Paige's Main Theme (3:31)</li><li>Scott Shelby's Main Theme (6:01)</li><li>Lauren Winter's Main Theme (3:07)</li><li>Painful Memories (1:29)</li><li>The Chase (1:25)</li><li>Redemption (1:39)</li><li>The Bulldozer (1:34)</li><li>High Tension (1:16)</li><li>The Fight (1:31)</li><li>The Hold Up (1:28)</li><li>Looking for Shaun (1:36)</li><li>Countdown (1:33)</li><li>Last Breath (2:59)</li></ol>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>21304</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/1794108-box_heavyrain.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/1794108-box_heavyrain.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/1794108-box_heavyrain.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/1794108-box_heavyrain.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/1794108-box_heavyrain.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1794108-box_heavyrain.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/1794108-box_heavyrain.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Heavy Rain]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>75</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-16/]]></api_detail_url><id>16</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: M]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-12/]]></api_detail_url><id>12</id><name><![CDATA[OFLC: MA15+]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-5/]]></api_detail_url><id>5</id><name><![CDATA[BBFC: 15]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-32/]]></api_detail_url><id>32</id><name><![CDATA[CERO: D]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-37/]]></api_detail_url><id>37</id><name><![CDATA[PEGI: 18+]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2010-02-23 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/]]></api_detail_url><id>146</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 4]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS4]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/heavy-rain/3030-21304/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21464/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-07-25 10:23:30</date_added><date_last_updated>2015-09-17 04:45:34</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[Follow Claude and Rena on their quest to investigate the Sorcery Globe in this enhanced remake of Star Ocean:  Second Story for the PSP.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Second Evolution is a remake of <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/star-ocean-the-second-story/3030-620" data-ref-id="3030-620">Second Story</a> (originally on PS1), similar to the remake of the original <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/star-ocean/3030-9032" data-ref-id="3030-9032">Star Ocean</a>, titled <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/star-ocean-first-departure/3030-21108" data-ref-id="3030-21108">First Departure</a>.

world around them.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">The Unfinished Swan is a game that was first shown at the 2009 Independent Games festival. In the first part of the game, the player begins in a space where everything is white. The game plays like a first-person shooter where the geometry of the level is revealed as ink is shot onto objects in the space. Some areas reveal messages such as "Don't be afraid" and "Please wake up."</p><p style="">Later mechanics include shooting drops of water onto the geometry to lead climbing vines around the walls, using light mechanics to stay safe and drawing geometry to create platforms that can than be used for platforming.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style="">The game follows the adventures of a recently orphaned child as he chases his mother's unfinished artwork, a painting of a <a data-ref-id="3015-3816" href="/swan/3015-3816">swan</a>, through a strange world. While there he finds that the King of this land had trouble finishing his work, and ultimately gives up trying to create a city in order to start a family. The King becomes too focused on his work and his pregnant wife, the boy's mother, leaves him. The boy finds his father, the King, in an unfinished statue and the King gives him his silver brush. The boy returns to the orphanage and is able to finish his mother's painting of the swan.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">The gameplay uses standard dual-analog or Playstation Move control from a first-person perspective to allow the player to move through the world - the move controller utilising the screen edge to look around. There are a number of gameplay mechanics introduced throughout the game, all with the theme of throwing globules of paint to interact with the world.</p><p style="">Initially, this is introduced as literal blank canvas in a white, blank world. The indelible black paint is the players only means of revealing the geometry and progressing through the first few levels, whereupon other colours are introduced.</p><p style="">The paint mechanic then turns to throwing water, the effect is now temporary, but can be used with numerous interactive elements in the form of paddles, controlling bridges, moving cranes and even dams.</p><p style="">The most prominent use of the water is in growing vines, creating a ladder mechanic to any surface in the game - horizontal or vertical - and allowing the player to scale towers or cross underneath bridges. Where the water splashes, the vines will leap out in growth to, it is only constrained by crevices featured where the vine mechanic is used, but the player is given relative freedom in their approach to a number of puzzles.</p><p style="">The later levels conversely are pitch black, where the player must stay in patches of light to stay safe. These can be created or expanded by hitting light sources, by pushing around a ball of light or by following it when rolling down a hill or through rivers and over waterfalls.</p><p style="">The final mechanic to be introduced uses the paint mechanic to create multicoloured cuboid objects upon any 'blueprint' surface. Where the first 2 paint globes land creates an X and Y bounding box, before using the final globe to adjust the depth. The boxes can also be manipulated and moved in certain circumstances.</p><p style="">The player can also collect balloons, which can then be used to buy "toys" which help the player by giving him more abilities to use in the game. Examples of which include a balloon radar, a sniper rifle, the ability to stop time momentarily for the paint globes as many others.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>24301</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/14/149021/2338624-uswan.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/14/149021/2338624-uswan.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/14/149021/2338624-uswan.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/14/149021/2338624-uswan.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/14/149021/2338624-uswan.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/14/149021/2338624-uswan.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/14/149021/2338624-uswan.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[The Unfinished Swan]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-29/]]></api_detail_url><id>29</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: E10+]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-18/]]></api_detail_url><id>18</id><name><![CDATA[PEGI: 7+]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-14/]]></api_detail_url><id>14</id><name><![CDATA[OFLC: G]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-25/]]></api_detail_url><id>25</id><name><![CDATA[CERO: A]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2012-10-17 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-88/]]></api_detail_url><id>88</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation Network (PS3)]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-network-ps3/3045-88/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3N]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-143/]]></api_detail_url><id>143</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation Network (Vita)]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-network-vita/3045-143/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PSNV]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/]]></api_detail_url><id>146</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 4]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS4]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/the-unfinished-swan/3030-24301/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[Kingdom Under Fire 2]]></aliases><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-24451/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2008-11-13 11:44:17</date_added><date_last_updated>2014-08-24 01:10:16</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[Phantagram's large-scale medieval action-strategy game returns on the PC, PlayStation 4.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<br /><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14036/813195-00773918.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-813195" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.596875" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:59.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14036/813195-00773918.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-813195"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14036/813195-00773918.jpg"></a><figcaption>This time the online mode will be similar to MMO game worlds.</figcaption></figure> Announced on January 28th 2008, Kingdom Under Fire II will be published by <a data-ref-id="3010-341" href="/phantagram-co-ltd/3010-341">    Phantagram</a> and developed by <a data-ref-id="3010-6276" href="/blueside/3010-6276">   Blueside </a>and is set to release sometime in 2012.  The game will feature both a single player storyline and a Massively Multiplayer Online RTS mode allowing players to do battle on an epic scale and gain control of the world map.

It showed a new character wielding a large sword and also being able to shoot guns. The number of units seem to be in-game and number in the estimated thousands. "Wyverns" were also shown but this time it seems you will have the option to directly control them. Another interesting aspect of the trailer is the fact that archers were seen on top of a castle wall, possible hinting at castle sieges. Finally, near the end of the trailer, a large creature was shown stomping through the battlefield and crushing units under it's feet. This could possible be a new unit or a successor to the "mammoth" in the original game.<br /><br /><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14036/813198-00773930.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-813198" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14036/813198-00773930.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-813198"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14036/813198-00773930.jpg"></a><figcaption>Many old characters will be returning.</figcaption></figure> The game takes place 150 years after the conclusion of  Kingdom Under Fire: The Crusaders.

Each guild has it's own sphere of influence and territory that must be defended. The amount of land you control expands through conquests, prestige, and as you gain more resources. The world map will be effected by every outcome of every battle as player and or guilds battle each other. Put simply, battles are fought with Peer-to-Peer sessions, a war is declared and the winner gets control of the territory. <br /></li><li>There will be different battlefield sizes, everything from 2 VS 2 maps to large 15 VS 15 maps. The number of troops that a player can control will depend on the size of the map.</li><li>Based on the results of the math, player will be rewarded with, items, war funds, and experience points.</li><li>There will be 160 hot spots where guilds and factions will fight each other for domination. There will be countless quests and mission to be completed. Some missions are story based, other are co-op based, and some are even competitive where you fight other rival players online on an incredibly large scale.</li></ul><br /><figure data-align="center" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/846701-200800000000015.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-846701" data-size="large" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="960" style="width: 960px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/846701-200800000000015.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-846701"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/19745/846701-200800000000015.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/19745/846701-200800000000015.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><ul class="plain-list"><li>The online mode allows you to trade and auctions items, manage your territory, take jobs from other players as a mercenary or what not, and many more features and activities yet to be announced.<br /></li><li>The game will have constant updates adding new content to the game on a regular basis.<br /></li><li>As you defeat enemies, you will gain experience and level up not only your heroes, but your commanding officers and even the troops themselves.

Then on July 24th 2014 the game a remake / enhanced version of the game (Trine: Enchanted Edition) was released on the <a href="/playstation-4/3045-146" data-ref-id="3045-146">PlayStation 4</a> and <a href="/wii-u/3045-139" data-ref-id="3045-139">Wii U</a> featuring a graphical overhaul using the engine used to create the sequel <a href="/trine-2/3030-31661" data-ref-id="3030-31661">Trine 2</a> and online multiplayer.</p><h2>Characters</h2><p style="">The characters in Trine are very much lighter versions of the archetypal definition of three very famous fantasy classes:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><h3>Amadeus, the <a href="../../wizards/92-1694/" rel="nofollow"><b>Wizard</b></a></h3> Amadeus is an "old" wizard still "studying" at the Astral Academy. Through a series of accidents, he's left behind in the castle when the undead army approaches. Usually, at Amadeus' age, wizards would have graduated and left, but Amadeus never quite passed the wizarding exams. He's never even learned the fireball spell, having always been more interested in flirting with the girls and going to great lengths to pretend that he's a magnificent wizard. However, this traditionally only leads to failure.<br /><u><b>Abilities</b></u>: Despite not having learned the fireball spell, Amadeus knows still a few useful spells. He can summon Boxes and Planks and he can also levitate objects. Through the course of the game, he will learn to cast Boxes and Planks in larger quantities.</td><td><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1552784-character_amadeus.png" data-ref-id="1300-1552784" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.4508196721311" data-width="122" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 122px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:145.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1552784-character_amadeus.png" data-ref-id="1300-1552784"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1552784-character_amadeus.png"></a><figcaption>Amadeus, the Wizard</figcaption></figure></td></tr><tr><td><h3>Pontius, the <a href="../../warriors/92-2646/" rel="nofollow"><b>Knight</b></a></h3> Pontius isn't really a Knight, but he does dream of joining the King's army and what better way to do that than to battle against the undead and prove himself worthy of knighthood? The problem is that Pontius doesn't really know what "undead" means, and he thinks he's the only one staying behind to face the enemy in the castle. Pontius is a large individual and enjoys a fine dose of meat at every hour or so. He's a friendly, happy fellow, and thinks good of everything and everyone. Unless he's hungry, of course. Pontius is a bit on the slow side, though -- he never gets a joke, and doesn't quite understand all the magic business going on around him.<br /><u><b>Abilities</b></u>: Pontius has an impressive arsenal of melee weapons. His strength also comes in handy when it comes to lifting heavy objects, or throwing them upon your enemies. Pontius also has a shield that he can use to block attacks. He cannot swim in his armor, though.</td><td><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1552786-character_pontius.png" data-ref-id="1300-1552786" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.4508196721311" data-width="122" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 122px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:145.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1552786-character_pontius.png" data-ref-id="1300-1552786"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1552786-character_pontius.png"></a><figcaption>Pontius, the Knight</figcaption></figure></td></tr><tr><td><h3>Zoya, the <a href="../../rogues/92-1460/" rel="nofollow"><b>Thief</b></a></h3> Zoya is from a distant land. She heard there was an ancient object with tremendous value in the castle and realizing that the Undead army marching towards the castle had already done half the job for her by leaving the castle abandoned, she feels that the time is right to break in and steal the precious treasure. Zoya is a great thief and has a soft spot for all things shiny, but not much else is known about her. She keeps to herself and doesn't like anyone asking her any questions. She's not one to reveal any kind of secrets about her.<br /><u><b>Abilities</b></u>: Zoya is an amazing archer. Her ranged attacks are great for hitting enemies at a long distances. Zoya also carries a grappling-hook that she can attach to wooden surfaces. She can then grab onto them and swing herself over ledges and climb up or down with the rope.</td><td><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1552787-character_zoya.png" data-ref-id="1300-1552787" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.4508196721311" data-width="122" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 122px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:145.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1552787-character_zoya.png" data-ref-id="1300-1552787"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1552787-character_zoya.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1552787-character_zoya.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Zoya, the Thief</figcaption></figure></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">Trine bills itself as a "physics-based action game", and focuses on platforming, combat, and simple puzzle solving. The player uses the knight, the thief, and the wizard to work their way through this 2D side scrolling environment, and can switch between the characters throughout the game at any time. Each character has their own individual abilities that can be used to solve various conundrums faced by the player.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1042974-trine_screenshot_2009_06_ef.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1042974" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1042974-trine_screenshot_2009_06_ef.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1042974"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1048/1042974-trine_screenshot_2009_06_ef.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1048/1042974-trine_screenshot_2009_06_ef.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Thief navigates the forests of Trine</figcaption></figure><p style="">The Knight uses a heavy sword, and can lift, carry and throw heavy objects, and can lift his shield to block attacks. The Thief can use a <a href="/grapple/3055-5" data-ref-id="3055-5">grappling hook</a> on wooden surfaces and use her bow and arrow to kill enemies and activate remote switches. The Wizard is unique in that he has the ability to summon physical objects, such as boxes and planks, which can be used as a stepping stone for higher jumps, to drop on enemies, or to block projectiles. Each character has their own health and energy bar as well which adds a layer of management to the game's equation.</p><h3>Leveling Up</h3><p style="">There are two ways to gain experience in Trine:</p><ol><li>Killing enemies and taking the "auras" or "souls" they leave behind</li><li>By finding green potions scattered and hidden throughout all the levels</li></ol><p style="">The latter creates interesting mini-challenges as you go, as these potions are often hidden or just apparently out of reach, causing the player to use creative problem solving to retrieve the potion. Once the player recovers a certain amount of green potions or enemy "souls", they are allowed to <a href="/leveling-up/3015-475" data-ref-id="3015-475">level up</a> one of the characters, granting upgrades like increased damage and new attacks. The secret treasure chests are generally hidden much more discreetly and requires the player to get creative in order to find &amp; reach their location. Treasures grant the characters other special abilities, and while some can be swapped between more than one character, others are character specific.</p><h3>Local Co-Op</h3><p style="">The game has local co-op multiplayer, allowing up to two other players to join your game. This adds a new element to the gameplay, by allowing new ways to overcome obstacles by combining each characters abilities. To play the game co-op on the <a href="/pc/3045-94" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC</a>, you may now use any <a href="/pc/3045-94" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC</a> <a href="/game-controller/3015-3601" data-ref-id="3015-3601">gamepad</a> (including the <a href="/pc-games-with-xbox-360-controller-support/3015-2465" data-ref-id="3015-2465">Xbox 360 controller</a>), or multiple <a href="/keyboard/3055-2361" data-ref-id="3055-2361">keyboards</a> and <a href="/mouse/3055-2362" data-ref-id="3055-2362">mice</a>. Each player may also assign their own controls if they wish.</p><p style="">Trine designer and <a href="">Frozenbyte</a> CEO, <a href="">Lauri Hyvärinen</a> has said they plan to add online multiplayer at a later date, but this seems less likely of possibility as time passes.</p><h2>Inventory Items</h2><p style="">Throughout the course of the game, the player -- if adventurous enough -- can find a series of items inside of <a href="/treasure-chest/3055-517" data-ref-id="3055-517">treasure chests</a> (some of them <a href="/hidden-treasure-chest/3055-3582" data-ref-id="3055-3582">hidden</a> away from the game's main path) that will make his/her journey through the world of Trine a lot easier.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Item</th><th>Item

PlayStation Network was delayed, likely in order to optimize it for the PS3 platform. In mid-July, a Frozenbyte employee posted on the game's official forums saying that the game would be released on July 30. However, on July 29 the same Frozenbyte employee wrote, "Unfortunately, Trine isn't coming to PSN this week, and this time it's our fault as there was discovered yet another small bug, which needed to be fixed."</p><p style="">Some cited the release of Sony's <a href="/fat-princess/3030-21184" data-ref-id="3030-21184">Fat Princess</a>, also scheduled for release on July 30, as the reason for the delay. They hypothesized that Sony must have forced Frozenbyte to push back the release of Trine, fearing low sales due to competition. However, that theory seemed less and less likely as more time passed without a Trine release.</p><p style="">Trine was eventually released on PSN in Europe on September 17th 2009, and on October 22nd in North America. One of the advantages of buying the game on PSN was supposed to be that it would be $10 cheaper than the PC version, but the price of the PC version dropped $10 before the PSN release, leaving that advantage unrealized.</p><h2>Free DLC...and Hint of a Sequel</h2><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8485/1347651-trine_2010_04_23_22_26_31_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1347651" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.8" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8485/1347651-trine_2010_04_23_22_26_31_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1347651"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8485/1347651-trine_2010_04_23_22_26_31_01.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8485/1347651-trine_2010_04_23_22_26_31_01.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>More Trine to come?</figcaption></figure><p style="">On April 19th 2010, Frozenbyte released a free DLC level for the PC titled "Path to New Dawn" (the level was later released on the PSN on August 3rd, 2010 for $0.99). The level becomes available upon completion of the game and features 10 unique items for players to collect.</p><p style="">Upon completing the level, an image of a dragon appears on screen with a note reading "The story has just begun...". While this teased that this might not be the end of the Trine storyline, the sequel for the game, <a href="/trine-2/3030-31661" data-ref-id="3030-31661">Trine 2</a>, wasn't officially unveiled until <a href="/e3-2010/3015-4529" data-ref-id="3015-4529">E3 2010</a>.</p><h2>Enchanted Edition</h2><p style="">In 2014, a new version of Trine, dubbed Enchanted Edition, was released for PC, Linux, Mac, PlayStation 4 and Wii U. The Enchanted Edition is a free update for owners of the Steam version but players can choose between it and the original base version upon starting the game. Now running on the more capable Trine 2 engine, the Enchanted Edition introduces an online co-op mode, mid-level saving.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style="">Trine is set in a fantasy kingdom, which was once beautiful and prosperous, but has since fallen into ruin due to an undead army that attacked the kingdom. Trine starts with three adventurers, a knight named <a href="/pontius/3005-10700" data-ref-id="3005-10700">Pontius</a>, a thief named <a href="/zoya/3005-10701" data-ref-id="3005-10701">Zoya</a>, and a wizard named <a href="/amadeus/3005-10699" data-ref-id="3005-10699">Amadeus</a>, who simultaneously stumble upon an ancient artifact called the Trine. All three touch the Trine at the same time, which magically fuses all three souls into one body. They each maintain their individual voices &amp; consciousnesses, but can only inhabit the single body one at a time. Luckily, they are able to transform into any one of the three characters at any time they choose.</p><p style="">The trio are reluctant to work together, but in order to find a way to counteract the Trine and separate their souls from each other, they are forced to battle their way through the kingdom and the <a href="/undead/3015-1155" data-ref-id="3015-1155">undead</a> armies to find a cure. The Wizard is able to decipher some ancient inscriptions, and they soon discover that the Trine is one part of a trio of ancient artifacts, representing the mind, the body, and the soul. The three artifacts are scattered through the kingdom, but the Wizard theorizes that if these three artifacts are brought together, it may free them from the Trine.</p><p style="">As the adventurers battle their way through the kingdom, they eventually do bring the three artifacts together, which indeed unbinds their souls from the Trine. Reuniting the artifacts also has the fortunate side effect of liberating the kingdom from the undead armies, and Pontius, Amadeus and Zoya are hailed as heroes.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1552791-trine_ost.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1552791" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.4798962386511" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:48.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1552791-trine_ost.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1552791"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/62890/1552791-trine_ost.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/62890/1552791-trine_ost.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Trine's Soundtrack Album Art</figcaption></figure><p style="">The <a href="/original-soundtrack/3015-189" data-ref-id="3015-189">soundtrack</a> for Trine was composed by <a href="/ari-pulkkinen/3040-90303" data-ref-id="3040-90303">Ari Pulkkinen</a>.

and complete levels. The main character, a white creature named Gomez, wears a fez and is obsessed with collecting hats.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Fez was first shown at the 2008 <a href="/igf-awards/3015-3939" data-ref-id="3015-3939">Independent Games Festival</a>. It was nominated for two awards and won the award for "Excellence in Visual Art". Following the awards, <a href="/phil-fish/3040-100988" data-ref-id="3040-100988">Phil Fish</a>, the mastermind behind Fez created "Polytron Corporation" as a banner under which he would develop and release the game.</p><h2>Development</h2><p style="">In <i>Indie Game: The Movie</i>, Fish talked about his five year struggle with trying to maintain Polytron Corporation by himself after his lead sound designer Jason DeGroot left. When showing the game at PAX Prime 2011, Fish risked a lawsuit with his former business partner due to unsettled royalty disputes. During development, Fez was completely remade three times due to lack of funding. The game was given an (ironic) release date of Friday the 13th of 2012. At the <i>Indie Game: The Movie</i> premiere, Fish stated that he currently has no plans to bring Fez to any other platform, but will consider doing so if the game sells well.</p><p style=""> </p><p style="">A PC version of Fez was released on May 1, 2013 (<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/224760/" rel="nofollow">Steam page</a>). Like the XBLA version, it's listed as being developed by Polytron and published by Trapdoor.</p><p style="">At Gamescom 2013, it was announced that Fez will come to PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation Vita.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p style=""><a href="/gomez/3005-9607" data-ref-id="3005-9607">Gomez</a> receives a letter, from a mysterious man with an <a href="/eyepatch/3055-94" data-ref-id="3055-94">eyepatch</a>, telling him to meet him at the top of his town, when he arrives a mysterious object appears in the sky; a cube. Gomez suddenly gains the ability to rotate the 2D world in which he lives, and must collect cubes and their counterpart, anti-cubes.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10652/1617998-fez_p.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1617998" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.56210526315789" data-width="475" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 475px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10652/1617998-fez_p.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1617998"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10652/1617998-fez_p.jpg"></a><figcaption>Gomez's room in 2D.</figcaption></figure><p style="">As a puzzle-platformer, Fez gameplay is primarily map traversal, discovery, and item collection. Gomez can innately walk, jump, climb, ledge grab, drop through ledges, push, pick up, and throw items. During the opening sequence he gains the ability to rotate the perceived 2D world in 90 degree increments, around the vertical (Y) axis of the screen. This reveals that the environment is fully 3D in nature. Despite the ability to traverse multiple planes, Gomez can only move and interact with the 2D plane relative to the player, and will always migrate to the foreground layer when possible. For example, he cannot enter a doorway from the side, or when a background passage is obscured by a foreground object – even if Gomez is standing between them. He appears shadowed when in the background layer, and a silhouette when completely obscured behind the environment. (The music also becomes muffled.)</p><p style="">Gomez has no health meter, and upon death (by fall or otherwise) he will immediately respawn on the last stable platform he stood on. He also retains momentum relative to the world while it is rotated: jumping to the right and then rotating 180 degrees will continue the momentum to the left, but rotating 90 degrees will stop all forward motion.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13158/839153-gb.png" data-ref-id="1300-839153" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13158/839153-gb.png" data-ref-id="1300-839153"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/13158/839153-gb.png"></a><figcaption>Gomez can rotate the world to reveal new perspectives.</figcaption></figure><p style="">There are 64 cubes to collect in total - 32 Gold Cubes and 32 Blue Anti-Cubes. As well as being able to find cubes throughout the world, cube bits can be collected throughout the game and once 8 cube bits are found they create 1 cube. Anti-cubes are generally more difficult to obtain, requiring puzzle solving rather than standard platforming. Some puzzles involve deciphering glyphs and following their instructions. Others are rhythm puzzles, where the controller vibrates and a rotational direction correlates to the sound the controller makes while it vibrates.</p><p style="">Once the ending kill screen is reached, the player can then start a New Game + after the credits and gain the ability to view the world from a first person perspective. Certain puzzles require use of the first person view in order to complete them. New Game + also unlocks the ability to fly (to activate press up four times and then hold A). Once the game is completed a second time, a stereoscopic 3D option is unlocked.</p><h2>Environment</h2><p style="">The world of Fez consists of several areas which appear normal, but may contain physics-defying characteristics even beyond Gomez's abilities. For example, some maps scroll infinitely up and down in an endless loop. Others have an infinite cycle of passages or use doors to teleport to far away islands.</p><h3>World Map</h3><p style="">The world map is an intricate and complex 3D tree of branching locations. Every level and room in the game is a separate "area", represented as a hexagonal cell. When an area is explored, the map cell indicates what items and secrets remain to be discovered. When all secrets within a single area are discovered, the thumbnail and border of that map cell acquires a gold sheen.</p><h3>Warping</h3><p style="">There are several hub areas within Fez, and cubic warp gates link them together once discovered and activated. Smaller square warp gates transport Gomez back to the start of an area, and save the player an excessive amount of backtracking. Simpler, shortcut doors also open up specific routes between areas once the entrance is discovered and unlocked.</p><h3>Hazards</h3><ul><li><a href="/falling-damage/3015-2510" data-ref-id="3015-2510">Falling</a> – Gomez can fall approximately 8 blocks before the drop will automatically kill him, unless he lands in water. This measurement counts from his starting position, and does not take jump height into account.</li><li><a href="/crushing-trap/3015-3627" data-ref-id="3015-3627">Crushing</a> – Certain platforms move vertically, and if they collide while Gomez is between them he will respawn on the last stable platform.</li><li><a href="/black-hole/3055-915" data-ref-id="3055-915">Black Holes</a> – Rips in space areas may appear in the environment. They suck Gomez in if he comes into contact with them.</li><li>Regenerating Blocks – <a href="/bomb/3055-97" data-ref-id="3055-97">Bombs</a> are required to remove certain blocks, but if the entire chain is not destroyed they will regenerate and knock Gomez off the platform.</li><li>Totems – In certain areas, there may be powerful totems which prevent Gomez from freely rotating the screen. These totems must be interacted with and backtracked to, in order to access all sides of an area.</li><li>Water – Gomez is a buoyant swimmer and can jump out of water with no loss of height. <a href="/water-that-damages-the-player/3015-3841" data-ref-id="3015-3841">Hazardous water</a> will kill him instantly.</li></ul><h2>Items</h2><h3>Artifacts</h3><p style="">There are four artifacts hidden around the world in Fez. With the exception of the skull, these artifacts contain glyphs and are used to help decipher the language and numbers.</p><ul><li>Writing Cube</li><li>Counting Cube</li><li>Tome</li><li>Skull</li></ul><h2>Glyphs</h2><p style="">Fez contains a hidden language, numerical system, and code. Each is conveyed through glyphs found throughout the game.</p><h3>Alphabet</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/15/156864/2183320-FEZ_Alphabet.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2183320" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.64705882352941" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:64.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/15/156864/2183320-FEZ_Alphabet.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2183320"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/15/156864/2183320-FEZ_Alphabet.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/15/156864/2183320-FEZ_Alphabet.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">The alphabet is most easily deciphered by entering a room where a red fox is jumping over a dog which is laying on the ground. Next to them are glyphs which correspond to the popular saying: the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. This sentence provides enough letters to construct the alphabet.</p><h3>Numbers</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/109148/2182961-numbers.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2182961" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.4868421052632" data-width="228" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 228px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:148.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/109148/2182961-numbers.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2182961"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/10/109148/2182961-numbers.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/10/109148/2182961-numbers.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Numbers in Fez can be expressed several ways. Numbers correlate to the open spaces in each square (if the player is looking at the white, negative space). One equals an open space on the top of the square. Two equals an open space on the right of the square. Three equals and open space at the bottom of the square. Four equals an open space the the left side of the square. Consulting the chart on the right, the number three can also be represent with an open space on the top and on the right; or, in other words, 1 + 2 = 3.</p><h3>Code</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/15/156864/2183323-FEZ_Inputs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2183323" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.6" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:60.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/15/156864/2183323-FEZ_Inputs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2183323"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/15/156864/2183323-FEZ_Inputs.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/15/156864/2183323-FEZ_Inputs.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">There are glyphs composed of <a href="/tetromino/3055-1722" data-ref-id="3055-1722">tetrominos</a> which represent controller inputs. These glyphs are usually written vertically from top to bottom, and they are usually connected to each other. When the corresponding buttons are pressed, a secret is revealed. Pro-tip: The center point of the T-blocks indicate their direction.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p style="">During Fez's development circa 2009, music was composed by Canadian resident artist "6955", <a href="/jason-degroot/3040-101692" data-ref-id="3040-101692">Jason DeGroot</a>. These demo tracks were <a href="http://polytroncorporation.com/fez-music" rel="nofollow">released</a> on Polytron's website. (Page has since been removed as of the OST release.)</p><p style="">The game's official soundtrack was composed and performed by the San Francisco resident artist "Disasterpeace", <a href="/rich-vreeland/3040-100079" data-ref-id="3040-100079">Rich Vreeland</a>. The digital album may be <a href="http://disasterpeace.com/album/fez" rel="nofollow">ordered</a> via Bandcamp, and was released on April 20th, 2012.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Number</th><th>Track Title</th><th>Length</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Adventure</td><td>3:18</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Puzzle</td><td>2:14</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Beyond</td><td>3:05</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Progress</td><td>4:16</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Beacon</td><td>2:33</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Flow</td><td>3:47</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Formations</td><td>2:20</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Legend</td><td>1:18</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Compass</td><td>2:43</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Forgotten</td><td>2:34</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Sync</td><td>2:19</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Glitch</td><td>3:25</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Fear</td><td>3:32</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>Spirit</td><td>2:52</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>Nature</td><td>4:10</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>Knowledge</td><td>1:49</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>Death</td><td>3:31</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>Memory</td><td>1:16</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>Pressure</td><td>4:00</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>Nocturne</td><td>2:13</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>Age</td><td>2:58</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>Majesty</td><td>3:22</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>Continuum</td><td>2:35</td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td>Home</td><td>1:35</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>Reflection</td><td>9:02</td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td>Love</td><td>1:09</td></tr></tbody></table><p style="">The track "<a href="http://disasterpeace.com/track/continuum" rel="nofollow">Continuum</a>", which appears in the final cinematic sequence, consists of an arrangement by Vreeland of Frederic Chopin's Piano Prelude Op. 28 No. 4 in E minor.</p><h3>Tracks used in media preview videos</h3><ul><li><a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/videos/this-is-one-long-fez-screenshot/2300-4826" data-ref-id="2300-4826">This Is One Long Fez Screenshot</a> - Beacon</li><li><a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/videos/an-even-longer-fez-screenshot/2300-4981" data-ref-id="2300-4981">An Even Longer Fez Screenshot</a> - Fear</li><li><a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/videos/fez-long-screenshot-the-third/2300-5350" data-ref-id="2300-5350">Fez Long Screenshot The Third</a> - Spirit</li><li><a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/videos/fez-long-trailer/2300-5775" data-ref-id="2300-5775">Fez Long Trailer</a> - Compass</li></ul><h3>Soundtrack Alternate Reality Game</h3><p style="">On April 20th a <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/961239-fez/62594884">GameFAQs thread</a> was created discussing spectrographic analysis of the soundtrack's files.

The game is an MMORPG released for both the <a href="/wii/3045-36" data-ref-id="3045-36">Wii</a> and the <a href="/wii-u/3045-139" data-ref-id="3045-139">Wii U</a> with later ports to Android devices, PC and Nintendo 3DS. Square Enix have also stated that bringing the game to the <a href="/nintendo-nx-working-title/3045-157" data-ref-id="3045-157">Nintendo NX</a> is "under consideration".</p><p style="">The Wii version of the game was released in Japan on the 2nd of August 2012 with a basic subscription fee of 1000 yen for 30 days. The Wii U released in Japan in Spring 2013.</p><p style="">The Nintendo 3DS version, unveiled in early July 2014 utilizes cloud-streaming technology to stream the game to the Nintendo 3DS. This allows for console-level graphics quality and cross-platform play with the Wii and Wii U versions of the game. However, since the game is running on Square Enix servers and streamed from there, it does not support the display of stereoscopic 3D. The missing buttons found on the other systems will be presented as icons on the 3DS' touch screen.</p><p style="">Features:</p><ul><li><a href="/nintendo-3ds/3045-117" data-ref-id="3045-117">3DS</a> <a href="/streetpass-functionality/3015-6609" data-ref-id="3015-6609">Streetpass</a> is supported via a separate app.</li><li>It can be played with a Wii Remote and Nunchuck, Classic Controller</li><li>USB keyboard can be used</li><li>The game uses a USB device of some kind for data management.</li><li>Some cross platform play with Wii and Wii U and 3DS.</li></ul><h2>Plot</h2><p style="">The protagonists are a mischievous pair of orphaned human siblings in the small village of Etene. Etene is also the home of residents Shini, a calm and reliable boy, and his grandmother Aba, a feisty shrine maiden.</p><p style="">After an initial portion of the game played as a human, the player character is reborn as a monster race. The player may choose from five races which their character will play the main part of the game as.</p><h2>Races</h2><p style="">The game has five playable tribes, each with a different continent in the world of Astordia.</p><h3>Ogres</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/134871/2006324-dragon_quest_x_ogre_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2006324" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/134871/2006324-dragon_quest_x_ogre_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2006324"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/134871/2006324-dragon_quest_x_ogre_02.jpg"></a></figure><p style="">Ogres are tall, horned, red humanoids known for their strength and courage. They come from the continent of <b>Ogreed (or Ogrelead)</b>. Ogreed has varied terrain types, including a snowy tundra-like area and an arid desert.</p><h3>Pukuripo</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/15/158652/2208135-main01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2208135" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/15/158652/2208135-main01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2208135"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/15/158652/2208135-main01.jpg"></a></figure><p style="">Pukuripo are small, greenish, cheerful creatures with jester-like outfits.

They come from <b>Dwachakka</b>, a very mountainous area with thin vegetation.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Housing system</h3><p style="">Each of the five continents has an area where the player can buy a plot of land and build their own house with a House Kit. The interior layout is customizable, and furniture and crafting equipment can be set up inside.</p><h3>Artisan system</h3><p style="">The player can begin crafting items by registering at a guild (as a clothes specialist, weapon smith, etc.). Once the player has the required items, they can craft objects through a minigame.</p><h3>Multiplayer</h3><p style="">Players can communicate between preset phrases and gestures, or they can use free-text input with a USB keyboard.</p><p style="">Players can invite others to join their party's with a preset message, whereupon both players will agree on a length of time that they'll play together.</p><p style="">If players spot another group fighting, they can use a support command which causes the group's tension to rise.</p><p style="">There are also AI characters which the player can recruit at a pub. They'll behave like the party members in Dragon Quest 9 and will use whichever tactics you set out for them. The player can also turn themselves into an AI character, so when they're offline someone else can recruit their AI controlled character. When the player comes back, they will retain the experience they earned as an AI.</p><h2>Classes</h2><p style="">Switching classes works a lot like Dragon Quest 9. The player goes to the Branch Office of Dharma's Shrine to switch classes. Some skills carry over between classes, others do not. The level of the player's previous job is retained in case they want to switch back.</p><h3>Warrior</h3><h3>Monk</h3><p style="">Monks have low health and attack stats, but they're very adept with recover magic. They can use spears, clubs, and staffs.</p><h3>Mage</h3><p style="">Along with their natural magic ability, mages can wield the dual-handed staff, dagger, and whip.</p><h3>Thief</h3><p style="">Thieves wield daggers, claws, and whips. They also learn a few spells.</p><h3>Martial Artist</h3><h3>Minstrel</h3><h2>Pricing/Payment Model</h2><p style="">In Japan, the game has a monthly subscription fee of 1,000 Yen (about $12). However, to accommodate for the Dragon Quest series' younger audience, players will have two hours of free time every day. The free game time is only available during specific hours, namely 4 to 6 p.m. on weekdays and 1 to 3 p.m. on weekends.</p><p style="">This was decided based on customer feedback during demo events. Players will be notified before their free game time ends and those without money in their account will have their game saved before the session gets terminated. Supposedly, these terms are subject to change and Square Enix emphasized that they intended the free time solely for younger children.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>24783</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/82063/2681880-dqx.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82063/2681880-dqx.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/82063/2681880-dqx.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2681880-dqx.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/82063/2681880-dqx.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/82063/2681880-dqx.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/82063/2681880-dqx.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Dragon

style="">Players play as an adventurer who, starting with a <a href="/whip/3055-327" data-ref-id="3055-327">whip</a>, some <a href="/rope/3055-633" data-ref-id="3055-633">rope</a>, and a few <a href="/bomb/3055-97" data-ref-id="3055-97">bombs</a>, explores a series of dangerous <a href="/randomly-generated-maps/3015-206" data-ref-id="3015-206">procedurally-generated</a> caves. Players explore the caves while amassing a fortune in treasure, acquiring better equipment, defeating relentless monsters, avoiding unforgiving <a href="/traps/3015-609" data-ref-id="3015-609">traps</a>, and saving <a href="/damsel-in-distress/3015-100" data-ref-id="3015-100">damsels in distress</a> along the way. However, the game features <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/permanent-death/3015-431" data-ref-id="3015-431">permadeath</a>, in which death results in restarting the adventure from the very beginning.</p><p style="">The updated version of the game (known as "Spelunky HD" to differentiate it from the original) was released for <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC</a> via <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/steam/3015-718" data-ref-id="3015-718">Steam</a> and <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/gogcom/3015-2379" data-ref-id="3015-2379">Gog.com</a> on August 8, 2013.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Mechanics</h3><p style="">As a 2D platformer, the core abilities of the player include: attack, stomp, run, jump, ledge grab, and climb. The player may fall a significant distance before taking damage, which can be avoided by careful ledge grabs or equipment use. Ledges two blocks high can be grabbed normally, and equipment can greatly improve the player's traversal. Knockback physics are a significant aspect of taking damage, throwing items, and using bombs to affect the environment or attack. Air control in mid-jump includes the ability to start running, allowing for very precise and practiced maneuvers.</p><h3>Rewards</h3><p style="">Items and monetary rewards such as gold and jewels are scattered through every level, out in the open or inside containers. These containers range from breakable jars, to locked chests, to the very ground itself. Rewards are converted to specific amounts of money which serves as the player's final accumulated score. Equipment can also be discovered in the world, or purchased from shops.</p><p style="">One or more "damsels" can be rescued throughout the levels. They exist stationary until picked up, at which point they will begin walking if put down or thrown. They will not jump out of pits and will not pass through webs. Damsels have hit points just like the player, and can act as a limited damage sponge while being carried or thrown to trigger traps.</p><p style="">In the HD version; the sprites used for damsels can be swapped between a woman, a man, a dog (which can optionality be swapped out for a sloth) or one of the three randomly. All damsels rescued reward the player (at the level complete screen) with a kiss that restores one heart each.</p><p style="">In addition to rescuing damsels, players can choose to use them as sacrifice them at altars to gain favor with Kali. This will net the player useful items that can used as they descend further and further.</p><h2>Shops</h2><p style="">The player can purchase various goods from stores that can exist on the map. There are gun shops, bomb shops, general stores, gambling rooms, and even a sort of brothel complete with a spinning red light. It is possible simply to purchase a gun and then shoot the shopkeeper, resulting in free items and some dropped money. This carries grave consequences, as the player will become "wanted" and will no longer be welcome in stores. Entering any store after shoplifting will result in the shopkeeper becoming immediately hostile and trigger a shopkeeper standing near the exit to every level until the player dies or escapes the caves. This makes the game much more difficult, as one has to either scavenge for health and supplies or risk their life to rob another store. Any damage caused to a store will similarly make the shopkeeper angry. This includes boulders from picking up an idol, and any stray bombs. If a shopkeeper ever drops his shotgun by taking damage, he is entirely capable of picking up other weapons from his inventory! An angry NPC with a rapid fire energy weapon is a fast track to death.</p><ul><li>Gun shops contain firearms or explosives.</li><li>Bomb shops can contain more bombs, or the sticky bomb upgrade.</li><li>General stores can offer a wide variety of things. It could be more ropes or bombs or a multitude of other items.</li><li>Item shops can contain rarer items such as jetpacks, teleporters, and mattocks.</li><li>Clothing shops contain wearable items such as the cape or climbing gloves.</li></ul><h2>Weapons</h2><ul><li><b>Whip</b> - The whip is the most basic weapon, and also one of the most versatile. The whip has a damage of 3, and can reach one square, but can also hit an enemy that's behind the player if it's close enough.</li><li><b>Machete</b> - While the machete does less damage than the whip, it has a much faster attack speed, and wider arc range. A useful weapon, but doesn't replace the whip, meaning it takes up a handslot.</li><li><b>Bow (Classic only)</b> - The bow is the most basic of projectile weapons. An arrow can be knocked into the bow, and charged for additional damage. The Bow uses limited ammunition, but can be refilled if the player picks up the missed arrows.</li><li><b>Pistol (Classic only)</b> - The pistol is a basic weapon with unlimited ammunition that does more damage than the bow, but is still low damage.</li><li><b>Shotgun</b> - A powerful weapon that fires a spread of pellets at the enemy. It can take down nearly any normal enemy in one hit at close range. All shopkeepers carry these, and the weapon can be looted from a shopkeeper's body after he is killed.</li><li><b>Webgun</b> - The webgun shoots a spiderweb into the world, which takes up one square, and considerably slows down any enemies caught in it. Often used to kill shopkeepers with the "unlimited bounce trick". Webs will also stop arrows fired by traps.</li><li><strong>Freeze Ray</strong> - A gun that shoots a ray of frost, instantly freezing enemies for a short while. The gun itself does no damage, but most frozen enemies can be killed with one hit from another weapon or by jumping on them.</li><li><strong>Plasma Cannon</strong> - A very powerful gun, that can be found in the mothership level. It shoots plasma rays, that explode on impact, much like a bomb would.</li><li><b>Magic</b> <b>Scepter</b> - This weapon shoots homing rings of death towards the closest enemy, which will one-hit kill any enemy. The item is only obtainable in the Ancient Ruins.</li><li><b>Boomerang</b> - A large bent stick that will return horizontally after being thrown across the screen. Found often in the Jungle levels. When thrown by cavemen it can <a href="/juggling/3015-273" data-ref-id="3015-273">juggle</a> and damage the player multiple times.</li><li><strong>Crysknife </strong>- A powerful knife that replaces the whip. The crysknife will one-hit kill most enemies in the game and is found in a pool of acid in the worm level.</li><li><strong>Shield</strong> - The Shield is a powerful melee weapon, capable of killing enemies whilst also blocking incoming damage.</li></ul><h2>Equipment</h2><p style="">Certain types of equipment are always active once obtained. These appear in their icon form underneath the life, bomb, and rope counters. Others work like carried items and can be picked up or left behind at will.</p><ul><li><b>Pitcher's Mitt</b> - The pitcher's mitt enhances the Spelunkers throw distance with any throwable item. Thrown items will be launched in a straight line and continue to travel until they hit an obstacle.</li><li><b>Spring Boots</b> - The spring boots boost the Spelunkers jump height from 2 squares to 4, making it double the height, and oftentimes, double the danger, in which the player will jump too high, and land in spikes!</li><li><b>Spike Boots</b> - The spike boots cause players do 3 damage on landing instead of 1. Also, the spike boots increase traction (particularly on ice).</li><li><b>Ropes</b> - In a single-player game, players begin with four ropes. Ropes allow players to climb up to hard to reach treasures, or allowing a safe descent from ledges.</li><li><b>Jetpack</b> - The Jetpack allows players to fly around levels. It is the most expensive item, but can be reliably found behind the psychic alien found in the Ice caves. The jetpack has a limited amount of fuel per jump; however, when players return to the ground, the fuel is restored.</li><li><b>Flares</b> - Flares are used to light up dark areas when there is no other light source, and can also be used as a makeshift projectile.</li><li><b>Spectacles</b> - Spectacles give the player the ability to see gems and items hidden in rocks, as well as giving the character the ability to have a wider range of view in dark levels.</li><li><b>Udjat Eye</b> - The Udjat Eye, in addition to showing hidden gems and items (like the Spectacles), blinks and chirps when the Spelunker is near the entrance to the Black Market.</li><li><b>Teleporter</b> - Allows teleportation in the direction the player is looking at or pressing towards, but if players teleport inside the ground or outside the level, they will die instantly. Also, most enemies are <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/telefrag/3015-40" data-ref-id="3015-40">telefragged</a> if players teleport into them.</li><li><b>Hedjet</b> - The hedjet can be used with the scepter to open the secret door to the city of gold. In the classic version of Spelunky, the hedjet allows the player to see in the dark and prevents the ghost from spawning.</li><li><strong>Kapala</strong> - A skull cup, provided by Kali, after making sufficient sacrifices to her. It stores blood, which can be obtained when enemies or NPCs have been injured. It affords one heart every time it's filled.</li><li><strong>Book of the Dead</strong> - Reveals the location of the secret door to Hell by grimacing quickly when the Spelunker is directly above it. It is found in the City of Gold and guarded by Anubis II.</li><li><b>Climbing Gloves</b> - Allows wall climbing on any surface.</li><li><b>Compass</b> - Provides a large arrow on the screen pointing to the exit door.</li><li><b>Mattock (Pickaxe)</b> - Allows digging through a roughly 50 blocks, recovering any gems or gold within. When broken, the head of the mattock is left behind.</li><li><b>Parachute</b> - Will deploy automatically during any fall that would cause damage.</li><li><b>Camera</b> - The flash distracts nearby enemies and can stun ghosts for several seconds. It can also be used to kill undead enemies.</li><li><strong>Eggplant</strong> - The eggplant can be found by sacrificing a mystery box at an altar. The eggplant can be used on King Yama to turn him into a giant, immobile eggplant himself.

Each world also has random events or "feelings" that may trigger when a level is generated.</p><h4>World 1 - The Mines</h4><p style="">The caves are the first tileset in Spelunky. Scattered with minimal gold, spiders, scorpions, bats, snakes, and the occasional caveman, this is the easiest location. Random events include:</p><ul><li>"I can't see anything!" - Darkness consumes the level, a torch appears at the player's feet and there are sconces to be lit throughout the level. Golden scarabs also generate light and can be collected for a large amount of gold.</li><li>"I hear snakes! I hate snakes!" - An increased number and variety of snakes spawn. Always includes a deep shaft with a mulititude of snakes and jewels at the bottom. Also features a Mattock to dig with.</li><li>"My Skin is Crawling..." - An increased number of all varieties of spiders and webbing.</li></ul><h4>World 2 - The Jungle</h4><p style="">The jungle is a considerable step up from the Caves. Littered with frogs, exploding frogs, spike idols, piranhas, man eating plants, and "Jaws", this is the second state of play. Random events include:</p><ul><li>"The dead are restless!" - Gravestones populate the area, with a higher likelihood of Skeletons lying in wait. Piranhas are skeletal (but just as dangerous), and Vampires and Jiang Shi roam.</li><li>"You hear rushing water..." - The bottom of the level is flooded, and filled with Piranhas. Old Bitey waits for any Spelunker brave enough to dive into the depths.</li></ul><h4>World 3 - The Ice Caves</h4><p style="">The Ice Caves are considerably easier than the previous floors, with subtle differences. The Ice Caves have little traction, meaning the player can slip and slide all over, and there is no enclosed floor, meaning the player can plummet to their deaths in The Abyss. In addition to the aforementioned perils, there are also Yetis, Alien spaceships, and a boss Psychic Alien.</p><h4>World 4 - The Temple</h4><p style="">The Ancient Ruins are the final standard levels in Spelunky. Featuring Lava pits, crush traps, earlier traps, Worshipers of Olmec, amongst many other environmental hazards, this is a test of any true Spelunker's mettle.</p><h4>World 5 - Hell</h4><p style="">Hell is the true final world accessible through the secret second exit of Level 4-4 after fighting Olmec. The exit can only be accessed with the Book of the Dead, located in the City of Gold. Hell features horned Devils, Vampires, and Succubi who pose as damsels. Spike traps, lava pits and swinging spike balls are also plentiful. The final boss, King Yama, awaits in his throne room on level 5-4.</p><h3>Tunnel Man</h3><p style="">At the end of each world players will come across Tunnel Man, a miner who asks for items in exchange for building a shortcut that allows players to start at a given level. He will ask for items in a certain order, and players are only allowed to give him one set of items in each encounter. The requirements for each tunnel are as follows.</p><ul><li><b>Jungle</b>: 1 bomb, 1 rope, $10000</li><li><b>Ice Caves</b>: 2 bombs, 2 ropes, a shotgun</li><li><b>Temple</b>: 3 bombs, 3 ropes, the Golden Key (brought from the mines)</li></ul><h3>Special Levels</h3><h4>The Haunted Castle</h4><p style="">The haunted castle can be found on any level where a text displays "The dead are restless." It's a level filled with undead and the legendary Black Knight, who wields a unique shield.</p><h4>The Worm</h4><p style="">It's possible to gain access to the worm level in levels featuring a sticky red dot. When jumping on there while also holding a damsel, a gigantic worm will appear and swallow the player. In the level, players are making their way through said worm's innards.</p><h4>The Black Market</h4><p style="">The Black Market can be found through a secret entrance in the Jungle. The Udjat eye can be used to pinpoint it's exact location. It's a place filled with numerous shops and it's possible to get the ankh there.</p><h4>The Mothership</h4><p style="">A level that can be found in the Ice Caves, when a text displays "It feels like the fourth of July..." It's an alien mothership, guarded by the alien queen, who can be killed for the very powerful plasma cannon.</p><h4>The City of Gold</h4><p style="">The legendary City of Gold can be found in the temple after killing Anubis. It's a city that is literally made of gold. It contains the book of the dead, which can be used to eventually reach Hell.</p><h2>DLC</h2><p style="">On February 20th, 2013 two pieces of downloadable content were released for Spelunky on Xbox 360. One piece of DLC included 24 new maps for use in the Spelunky's deathmatch mode while the other provided an additional 8 characters for use in the game. Both pieces of DLC are priced at 160 <a href="/microsoft-points/3015-5685" data-ref-id="3015-5685">Microsoft Points</a>. Developer Derek Yu stated on the Mossmouth forums that paid Spelunky DLC would be relegated to fun extras and that any additional content to the single player game such as new levels would be provided free of charge via an Xbox Live title update.</p><p style="">The later PC, PS3 and Vita releases of Spelunky included all the DLC content.</p><h2>Development</h2><p style="">Spelunky began as a freeware 2D rogue like platformer (now known as Spelunky Classic) developed and released by <a href="/derek-yu/3040-90931" data-ref-id="3040-90931">Derek Yu</a> for the <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC</a> on September 1, 2009.</p><p style="">Soon after releasing the game, <a href="/derek-yu/3040-90931" data-ref-id="3040-90931">Derek Yu</a> founded a small independent developer named <a href="/mossmouth-llc/3010-7356" data-ref-id="3010-7356">Mossmouth</a> with <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/andy-hull/3040-103830" data-ref-id="3040-103830">Andy Hull</a>, which then developed an updated version of Spelunky for the <a href="/xbox-360/3045-20" data-ref-id="3045-20">Xbox 360</a> (via <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360-games-store/3045-86" data-ref-id="3045-86">Xbox 360 Games Store</a>). It was published by <a href="/microsoft-studios/3010-340" data-ref-id="3010-340">Microsoft</a> on July 4th, 2012 for 1200 MSP (USD$15). Along with redone high-definition graphics and advanced graphical effects, the update includes local multiplayer (in both the traditional "adventure" mode and a new competitive "deathmatch" mode, which is a series of <a href="/last-man-standing/3015-4788" data-ref-id="3015-4788">"last man standing"</a> bouts in similar vein to the <a href="/bomberman/3025-67"

Navigation of these obstacles requires extremely precise timing to pass. Failure means instant death and a quick restart from the beginning of the level. The player is given an infinite amount of lives and near-instantaneous respawns, but Meat Boy leaves a trail of blood to mark where he has been and what obstacles previously killed him. When a regular level is completed, a <a href="/instant-replay/3015-45" data-ref-id="3015-45">replay</a> showcases every attempt within the level simultaneously.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Characters have two abilities at their disposal: a <a href="/jump/3015-379" data-ref-id="3015-379">jump</a> button and an ability button. For Meat Boy (and most other characters), pressing the ability button engages sprinting. Some characters sprint automatically and replace the ability button with another power, such as <a href="/tim/3005-5730" data-ref-id="3005-5730">Tim's</a> ability to rewind time or <a href="/viridian/3005-16930" data-ref-id="3005-16930">Viridian's</a> ability to inverse his own personal gravity. To keep the difficulty in check, the game features extremely precise controls. Quickly tapping the jump button performs a small hop, while holding down the jump button performs a tall leap. Players can also stick to the wall (which may either slow their descent or slightly continue their ascent) and press the jump button again for a <a href="/wall-jump/3015-5" data-ref-id="3015-5">wall jump</a>. Some unlockable characters have special jumping abilities, such as <a href="/the-kid/3005-16987" data-ref-id="3005-16987">the Kid's</a> ability to double jump and <a href="/jill/3005-16969" data-ref-id="3005-16969">Jill's</a> ability to stall her descent.</p><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1283745-supermeatboy_release_2010_01_11_01_00_17_28.png" data-ref-id="1300-1283745" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1283745-supermeatboy_release_2010_01_11_01_00_17_28.png" data-ref-id="1300-1283745"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/26/1283745-supermeatboy_release_2010_01_11_01_00_17_28.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/26/1283745-supermeatboy_release_2010_01_11_01_00_17_28.png"></noscript></a></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Over the course of the game, new mechanics are introduced and obstacles become more complex. These include rising tides of lava, portals, magnetic fields, fans, lava rocks, and eventually enemies that hunt down the player character. All obstacles will result in instantaneous death upon contact. The "<a href="/bosses/3015-229" data-ref-id="3015-229">bosses</a>" are equally indestructible; instead of actually fighting them, these levels require players to navigate difficult puzzles under time restraints until a <a href="/cutscene/3015-22" data-ref-id="3015-22">cutscene</a> is triggered.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Players can also collect bandages scattered around certain levels to unlock characters and certain levels. In order for the player to keep Bandages, they must collect them and successfully reach the exit in one attempt. Some bandages require specific characters and all are difficult to collect, especially in the purple Warp Zones, where players must not only collect the Bandage, but clear each of the three levels with a limited number of lives.</p><h2>Levels</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Super Meat Boy features five main worlds, each with forty regular levels. The initial twenty levels are referred to as the "Light World". If the player is able to clear a Light World level under its par time, they will be able to access the "Dark World" counterpart (which shares the same basic geometry, but has a different appearance and increased difficulty). Each Light World version of the five main worlds also include a boss level, which must be completed in order to progress to the next world. Boss levels are unlocked after the player beats 17 out of the 20 Light World levels.</p><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1406229-supermeatboy_esrb_nyrt_720p30_st_66.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1406229" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1406229-supermeatboy_esrb_nyrt_720p30_st_66.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1406229"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/669/1406229-supermeatboy_esrb_nyrt_720p30_st_66.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/669/1406229-supermeatboy_esrb_nyrt_720p30_st_66.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Meat Boy entering a Warp Zone. </figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Along the way, players can also find purple <a href="/warp-zone/3015-804" data-ref-id="3015-804">Warp Zones</a> within certain levels. These portals vanish after a set period of time during the level attempt, though reaching these portals makes the Warp Zone available in the level selection screen. Entering a Warp Zone will transport Meat Boy (regardless of which character reaches the warp zone) to a retro-themed zone which is notably difficult. Each zone comes with three levels that must be completed consecutively with a special version of Meat Boy. Bandages are found within these warp zones, but the player will only have three attempts per level to collect them and clear the Warp Zone. If Meat Boy dies during the final attempt at any level, all bandages found during the Warp Zone attempt will be reset, and the player will be kicked back to the level selection screen. Replays and par times are unavailable for Warp Zones.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Red Warp Zones function similarly to purple Warp Zones but are played instead with a secret character. There are no bandages in red warp zones but there are also unlimited lives. There are only five red warp zones, one in each of the main Light Worlds. Each main world also has a special "<a href="/glitch/3015-511" data-ref-id="3015-511">glitch</a> zone", reached by getting to Bandage Girl while she is in a randomly occurring "glitch state". Glitch zones feature no bandages and only one level, which is typically longer and more difficult than any of the world's Warp Zones.</p><h3>Chapter 1: The Forest</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0"><strong>Intro Cutscene Tribute:</strong> <a href="../../street-fighter-ii/61-243/" rel="nofollow">Street Fighter II: The World Warrior</a></p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0"><strong>Boss:</strong> Lil' Slugger (giant walking chainsaw driven by Dr. Fetus)</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The Forest introduces buzzsaws, static sawblade launchers, and impassable tiles that crumble away soon after the player touches it.</p><h3>Chapter 2: The Hospital</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0"><strong>Intro Cutscene Tribute:</strong> <a href="../../castlevania/61-6673/" rel="nofollow">Castlevania</a></p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0"><strong>Boss:</strong> <a href="/chad/3005-15923" data-ref-id="3005-15923">C.H.A.D.</a> (mutated living abomination of blood and tissue)</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The Hospital introduces fans, crawling slimes that stick to surfaces, floating enemies that bounce around aimlessly, piles of deadly needles, keys that unlock certain tiles, and timed laser beams.</p><h3>Chapter 3: The Salt Factory</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0"><strong>Intro Cutscene Tribute:</strong> <a href="../../the-adventures-of-lolo/61-5026/" rel="nofollow">The Adventures of Lolo</a></p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0"><strong>Boss:</strong> <a href="/brownie/3005-17017" data-ref-id="3005-17017">Brownie</a></p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The Salt Factory introduces harmful salt, homing missile launchers, moving platforms, tiles that only crumble away after coming in to contact with a missile, and high-speed conveyor belts.</p><h3>Chapter 4: Hell</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0"><strong>Intro Cutscene Tribute:</strong> <a href="../../ninja-gaiden/61-1653/" rel="nofollow">Ninja Gaiden</a></p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0"><strong>Boss:</strong> <a href="/little-horn/3005-17018" data-ref-id="3005-17018">Little Horn</a> (monster made of Meat Boy corpses)</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Hell introduces lava pits (that sometimes rise), moving lava rocks, portals, rotating eyes that slowly lock on to the player while shooting laser beams, and demon homing missiles that split in to separate small missiles on impact.</p><h3>Chapter 5: Rapture</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0"><strong>Intro Cutscene Tribute:</strong> <a href="../../mega-man-2/61-14026/" rel="nofollow">Mega Man 2</a></p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0"><strong>Boss:</strong> Larrie's Lament (a group of enormous carnivorous worms)</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Rapture introduces orbs that repulse the player, abominations (both running and flying) that head towards the player, and homing sawblade launchers.</p><h3>Chapter 6: The End</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0"><strong>Intro Cutscene Tribute:</strong> <a href="/pokemon-redblue/3030-3966" data-ref-id="3030-3966">Pokémon Red/Blue</a></p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0"><strong>Boss:</strong> <a href="/dr-fetus/3005-15922" data-ref-id="3005-15922">Dr. Fetus</a></p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Unlocked after completing Chapter 5, The End includes five regular levels (with both Light World and Dark World variations) that can only be played by Meat Boy and are designed to test the player's mastery of previous concepts.

"inspired by" and a "rebirth" of the now twenty-year-old original rather than a straightforward remake.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview <br /></h2><i>A Boy and His Blob</i>, a remake of the  classic puzzle-platformer for the <a data-ref-id="3055-2794" href="/nes/3055-2794">            Nintendo Entertainment System</a>, was revealed in Nintendo Power on March 5th, 2009.<br /> <br />The new art style uses hand-painted backgrounds and hand drawn character models, paired with advanced lighting and visual effects. A greater emphasis is also put on the friendship and reliance on one another between the <a data-ref-id="3005-2680" href="/a-boy/3005-2680">         Boy</a>, now with an even younger design, and the <a data-ref-id="3005-1188" href="/blobert/3005-1188">        Blob</a> (who is not named "Blobert" as in the previous games).<br /><br />  A Virtual Console release of the original <a data-ref-id="3030-20314" href="/david-cranes-a-boy-and-his-blob-trouble-on-blobolonia/3030-20314"> <i>A Boy and His Blob: Trouble on Blobonia</i></a> has also been rated by the ESRB, assumed to pique interest shortly prior to this full release.<br /><br /><h2>Development <br /></h2><i>A Boy and His Blob</i> is the brainchild of <a data-ref-id="3010-2294" href="/wayforward-technologies/3010-2294">                WayForward Technology</a>'s Director,  Sean Velasco. Being a fan of the original property, he thought it was an idea which had a lot of potential the team could explore upon the completion of <a data-ref-id="3030-4237" href="/contra-4/3030-4237"> <i>Contra 4</i></a>. They thought about refinements in gameplay they could take advantage of, coupled with the studio's fresh animation and presentation techniques, and particular strength for two-dimensional platform games. A pitch was made to <a data-ref-id="3010-370" href="/majesco-entertainment/3010-370">                Majesco Entertainment</a> through Creative Director, <a data-ref-id="3040-80202" href="/matt-bozon/3040-80202">                Matt Bozon</a> at E3 in 2008.<br /><br /> The series creator, <a data-ref-id="3040-29662" href="/david-crane/3040-29662">                David Crane</a> is said to be with the team "in spirit" whenever they play the original game for reference, but is not involved with the project on a day-to-day basis.<br /><br /><h2>Story <br /></h2>The story starts out with the Blob crash-landing on Earth looking for someone to help him save his beloved home planet of Blobolonia. When The Boy meets the Blob, they begin their quest to dethrone an evil emperor who has taken over the peaceful planet of Blobolonia. Their first task is to travel through a forest on Earth, which contains some enemies which are presumed to be minions of the evil emperor. The pair then travels through a cave near a city, encountering more obstacles. Outside of the cave, the blob transforms into its rocket form and takes the boy to Blobolonia. The two trek through Blobolonia, finding increasingly bleak landscapes as they grow closer to a large castle, which is the center of the emperor's reign. After fighting through the castle, the boy and the blob defeat the emperor, freeing Blobolonia from his dark reign. The blob once again transforms into a rocket, returning the boy to his treehouse. In the nearby forest, the pair encounters a massive monster. After defeating it, the boy and blob part ways in a brief, but heartfelt cutscene. The blob transforms into a rocket to return to Blobolonia, and the boy is left to go on with his life. The story is not delivered through long-winded cutscenes, but rather subtle hints in the context of the world and interactions with characters, leaving a lot to interpretation in the same vein as  <a data-ref-id="3030-2980" href="/half-life/3030-2980"> <i>Half-Life</i></a>. The ending has been described by the game's Producer, <a data-ref-id="3040-5073" href="/robb-alvey/3040-5073">                Robb Alvey</a> as "touching".<br /><br /><h2>Gameplay <br /></h2> <figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1097602-bahb2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1097602" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1097602-bahb2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1097602"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5911/1097602-bahb2.jpg"></a><figcaption>The Boy just floating along with Blob. </figcaption></figure> Like most 2-D puzzle-platformers, <i>A Boy and His Blob</i> has the player travel through various levels by solving puzzles. This is done by feeding Blob a variety of jelly beans. By feeding him these treats, Blob transforms into one of 15 different objects (anvil, trampoline, parachute, etc.), allowing the Boy to get to points he couldn't get to before. When holding down the Nunchuck's C button a radial menu pops with the kinds of jelly beans available. With the wanted bean chosen, the player throws the bean by pressing B. The player may also hold it down to be able to more accurately throw the bean where they want it go. Using the Z button causes the Boy to call for the Blob. This call transforms Blob back into his normal blobby self.  <br /> <br />Although the game has many types of beans, not all the jelly beans are available for each level. At the start of the level, the Boy only has the specific kinds of jelly beans that are needed to solve the puzzles. With that said, one level may see the Boy with three beans, while another may see the whole radial menu filled up.   <br /> <br />Each stage contains 3 chests that can be found and eaten by blob, and then regurgitated once the duo have returned to the tree house. If you manage to find all 3 in a given stage, then a bonus challenge stage will be unlocked. Upon completion of the bonus stage, concept art or videos will be unlocked for your viewing pleasure. Finding these chests is not required though, only navigating the boy and his blob safely to the end of the level.<br />  <b> <br /></b><h2><b>Miscellaneous Information</b></h2><b></b><ul class="plain-list"><li>The game runs at 480p in 16:9.</li></ul><ul class="plain-list"><li>There is a button dedicated solely to hugging.

The game was first announced in February 2007 through a full-page advertisement in the Japanese gaming magazine <i>Famitsu</i>. It was shown publicly for the first time in trailer form at <a href="/e3-2009/3015-3244" data-ref-id="3015-3244">E3 2009</a>.</p><p style="">At E3, The Last Guardian was announced as an exclusive to the <a href="/playstation-3/3045-35" data-ref-id="3045-35"> PlayStation 3</a>. Very few concrete details were released about the title, but the artwork indicates that it would share similarities with the visuals in Team Ico's previous works,<a href="/ico/3030-9638" data-ref-id="3030-9638"> Ico</a> and <a href="/shadow-of-the-colossus/3030-6522" data-ref-id="3030-6522"> Shadow of the Colossus</a>. It is not known if The Last Guardian is set within the same world as the previous Team Ico games.</p><p style="">The Last Guardian was last shown to the public in a trailer at TGS 2010. Since then, it has been met with extensive delays. Though it was originally announced as a PS3 title, at E3 2015 it was re-revealed as now being a Playstation 4 game.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style="">From the E3 2009 trailer, it can be deduced that, as was the case with Ico, the game will again feature a young boy as the main character; in this case, one who will interact with a large creature named "<a href="/toriko/3005-16399" data-ref-id="3005-16399">Toriko</a>." The creature has purposely been designed as an amalgamation of several different types of animals, as designer <a href="/fumito-ueda/3040-89582" data-ref-id="3040-89582">Fumito Ueda</a> feels this will create a greater sense of empathy in the player. The developers have stated that player's shouldn't expect the creature to be too intelligent and that luring it onwards may be an important aspect of gameplay.</p><h2>Development</h2><p style="">In March 2009 at the Game Developers Conference '09, Ueda stated during a Q&amp;A session that "it [the new game] might be similar to what's been done," and "the essence of the game is rather close to 'Ico.'"</p><p style="">On May 19 2009, PlayStationLifestyle.net released a several images and a video of the studio's newest project. Tentatively titled 'Project Trico', the footage began with the scene shown previously in the first image. It showed a boy together with a giant feathered beast traversing vast temple ruins, the architecture similar in style to both Ico and Shadow of the Colossus. It was revealed to be old footage however, shown internally within Sony.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-ref-id="1300-1043394" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3068/1043394-tlg.jpg" data-ratio="1.7777777777778" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:177.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3068/1043394-tlg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1043394"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3068/1043394-tlg.jpg"></a></figure><p style="">On June 1 2009, the game was officially revealed at Sony's E3 press conference, with the first trailer being shown. It was an updated version of the footage that had been leaked previously, with the scenes slightly edited and now showing a lot more polish, in addition to completely new scenes. The game's title was revealed to be 'The Last Guardian.' New screenshots were officially released too. Sony Computer Entertainment announced at E3 that The Last Guardian is a 2010 release, and Ueda declined to go into further specifics, other than to say "there is definitely a reason why we are announcing this when we are."</p><p style="">On September 24 2009, The Last Guardian made a highly-anticipated appearance at Tokyo Game Show on the first day, albeit in limited form. While there was still no playable demo present, a new trailer was shown, revealing a few more scenes of gameplay. Another batch of screenshots were also released, in addition to <a href="/the-last-guardian-tgs-09-interview/2300-1416" data-ref-id="2300-1416"> a short behind-the-scenes look</a> at the game's development featuring Ueda.</p><p style="">At TGS 2010, Ueda announced a late 2011 release for the game, but by April 2011, a post on the EU PlayStation blog revealed a delay to both The Last Guardian and <a href="/the-ico-shadow-of-the-colossus-collection/3030-32696" data-ref-id="3030-32696">The Ico &amp; Shadow of the Colossus Collection</a>. The reason provided was "to provide more challenging and better quality of content to users and to fulfill First Party Studio’s obligations". </p><p style="">As of late 2011, Ueda is no longer a full-time employee of Sony Computer Entertainment. He has since joined a company called Bossa Studios, but it has been stated that he is continuing to work on The Last Guardian in a freelance capacity.</p><p style="">On February 13, 2013, <a href="/shuhei-yoshida/3040-63461" data-ref-id="3040-63461">Shuhei Yoshida</a> announced a significant amount of work on The Last Guardian had to be completely redone. “At one point we felt that it would be produced for a certain time period. That was the time we prematurely talked about the launch window. But it turned out the technical issues are much harder to solve. So the engineering team had to go back and re-do some of the work they had done.”</p><p style="">On June 11, 2013, at E3, <a href="/jack-tretton/3040-700" data-ref-id="3040-700">Jack Tretton</a> commented that development of The Last Guardian is "on hiatus"; phrasing that suggests that the game is no longer in development. However, Yoshida later commented to Kotaku's Stephen Totilo and clarified that the game is still in active development and requested that the public continue to have patience.</p><p style="">On June 7, 2014, the website IGN reported that The Last Guardian had been cancelled, citing an "internal source" that spoke with IGN Russia. This news was quickly refuted by <a href="/scott-rohde/3040-30099" data-ref-id="3040-30099">Scott Rohde</a> of Sony Worldwide Studios on Twitter. IGN later backtracked, updating <a href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/08/the-last-guardian-cancelled" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">their article</a> to reflect the conflicting reports they received.</p><p style="">On June 15, 2015, at E3, The Last Guardian finally made a reappearance at Sony's Press Conference. Sony showed <a href="/videos/e3-2015-the-last-guardian-it-s-real/2300-10308" data-ref-id="2300-10308">a brand new trailer</a> which featured gameplay of the game on the Playstation 4 and a release date of 2016.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year>2016</expected_release_year><id>26513</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/9/97089/2327757-untitled.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/97089/2327757-untitled.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/9/97089/2327757-untitled.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/9/97089/2327757-untitled.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/9/97089/2327757-untitled.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/97089/2327757-untitled.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/9/97089/2327757-untitled.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[The Last Guardian]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating/><original_release_date/><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/]]></api_detail_url><id>146</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 4]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS4]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/the-last-guardian/3030-26513/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[Arcade Archives: Argos no Senshi

This nameless Legendary Warrior sets out to defeat the eponymous warlord Rygar (or Ligar) in order to save his homeland from destruction.</p><p style="">It was originally released in the Arcades in 1986 and received a handful of home system conversions. These include the Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, Atari Lynx and ZX Spectrum. A Japan-only Master System version, named Argus no Juujiken, was released in 1988. </p><p style="">A game named <a href="/rygar/3030-10397" data-ref-id="3030-10397">Rygar</a> was released on the NES, but like other arcade-to-NES games such as <a href="/strider/3030-12558" data-ref-id="3030-12558">Strider</a> and <a href="/bionic-commando/3030-7860" data-ref-id="3030-7860">Bionic Commando</a>, Rygar on the NES is a full-fledged action-adventure game with an open-world to explore.</p><p style="">Rygar was eventually rebooted for the PS2 with <a href="/rygar-the-legendary-adventure/3030-14034" data-ref-id="3030-14034">Rygar: The Legendary Adventure</a> in 2002. <a href="/tecmo-classic-arcade/3030-328" data-ref-id="3030-328">Tecmo Classic Arcade</a>, released for the Xbox in 2005, contains the original Arcade version of Rygar. The Arcade version of Rygar was also released on the Wii's <a href="/virtual-console/3015-2925" data-ref-id="3015-2925">Virtual Console</a>, and again for the PS4 as part of Hamster's <a href="/arcade-archives/3025-3081" data-ref-id="3025-3081">Arcade Archives</a> range.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">Rygar features a series of levels where the player must reach the end of the stage before the time limit runs out. The player is armed with a large disc weapon which is attached to the character's wrist by a short chain. The weapon can be upgraded to a larger version during the game.</p><p style="">The game is notable in that despite having a time limit, the game does not automatically end when the timer expires. Instead, a demonic monster appears that will actively pursue (and usually kill) the player as they race for the exit.</p><p style="">The arcade version of Rygar contains 27 stages, after which the game presents a short, celebratory sequence and ends the game.</p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>26561</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/1/14912/1032735-41206401.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14912/1032735-41206401.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/1/14912/1032735-41206401.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14912/1032735-41206401.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/14912/1032735-41206401.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/14912/1032735-41206401.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/1/14912/1032735-41206401.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Rygar]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-25/]]></api_detail_url><id>25</id><name><![CDATA[CERO:

In turn, attributes like accuracy, precision or stamina, are increased automatically. A unique attribute of Shadow Complex's XP system is the idea of XP multipliers. If the player performs certain actions (head shots, melee attacks) a multiplier is added for every successful move, increasing the overall XP reward. Shadow Complex also rewards the player for defeating larger enemies like bosses by exploiting their weaknesses or attacking them in clever ways. While all enemies can be defeated simply by continuous shooting for extended periods of time, the game "knows" when this is taking place and gives less XP.</p><p style="">Additionally, uncovering squares of the map grants more experience than killing enemies. However, acquiring collectibles grants the most experience of all. This means that there is more incentive to explore and play through the game multiple times.</p><h3>Challenge Rooms</h3><p style=""><a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/challenges/3015-1925" data-ref-id="3015-1925">Challenge rooms</a> are included to hone the player's skills, all with accompanying online <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/leaderboard/3015-30" data-ref-id="3015-30"> leaderboards</a>.

Closed beta testing began on July 13th, 2010, and the game's open beta started on September 2nd, 2010. The game launched with a Limited Collector's Edition on September 22nd, 2010, and the standard edition launched on September 30, 2010 worldwide on <a href="/pc/3045-94" data-ref-id="3045-94">Windows</a> PC platforms. The game was not released as a part of Square Enix's <a href="/playonline/3015-1540" data-ref-id="3015-1540">PlayOnline</a> service that Final Fantasy XI operates under, but under a new "Square Enix Account" system planned for use with all future Square Enix online titles.</p><p style="">Upon its release, Final Fantasy XIV was savaged by critics and players alike for dull, tedious, and outdated gameplay. The response was so severe that Square Enix president <a href="/youichi-wada/3040-48566" data-ref-id="3040-48566">Youichi Wada</a> publicly apologized for the game's quality. The game's development team was reorganized and the free trial period was extended while the company made efforts to improve the title.</p><p style="">The PlayStation 3 version of the game was put on indefinite hold, while the title's many faults were addressed.</p><h2>A New Producer/Director and A Realm Reborn</h2><p style="">On December 10, 2010, a massive shakeup occurred amongst the development and planning teams of Final Fantasy XIV, in wake of the game's extremely negative launch.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1665/2305524-a_realm_reborn.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-2305524" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.56231884057971" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1665/2305524-a_realm_reborn.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-2305524"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1665/2305524-a_realm_reborn.jpeg"></a></figure><p style=""><a href="/naoki-yoshida/3040-99324" data-ref-id="3040-99324">Naoki Yoshida</a>, a relative unknown amongst fans of Square Enix titles, stepped in to the role of both Producer and Director, replacing the positions held by <a href="/hiromichi-tanaka/3040-61873" data-ref-id="3040-61873">Hiromichi Tanaka</a> and <a href="/nobuaki-komoto/3040-92945" data-ref-id="3040-92945">Nobuaki Komoto</a> respectively. With this and other staff changes made at key positions, an air of change began in the development of the title. Yoshida opened lines of communication with the players through players polls, and new official forums. This kind of communication with players was unheard of in the series' previous MMO, Final Fantasy XI. Player feedback has became a top priority, and since his arrival, many game mechanics that players found arduous and non-friendly were removed (Fatigue system, Physical levels, etc.) or given totally new roles (Guildleves changing from the main crux of the game's content, to being a method of easier solo-play).</p><p style="">While many of the changes to the original game were welcomed by the game's player base, there were many other changes that the team could not implement due to limitations in the original game engine and servers. So, it was announced in late November 2011 that the game would be completely rebuilt from the ground up, and become an entirely new client. This project was originally named Final Fantasy XIV: Version 2.0<i>.</i></p><p style="">The introduction of Version 2.0 brought numerous elements into play that were not possible in the original game.

Now labeled "Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn", the new game client went through extensive alpha/beta testing through the first half of 2013.</p><p style="">Unlike the original release's beta test, where nearly no feedback was taken into account, the game underwent a great many changes while in beta testing due to player feedback.</p><p style="">The relaunched Final Fantasy XIV on sale August 27, 2013 for Windows and PlayStation 3 in Japan, North America and Europe simultaneously to nearly universal acclaim and praise for the complete turnaround the title made from the original release.</p><p style=""> </p><h2>The Armoury System</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4086/1166042-final_fantasy_xiv_2009_10_08_09_19.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1166042" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.382099827883" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:138.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4086/1166042-final_fantasy_xiv_2009_10_08_09_19.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1166042"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4086/1166042-final_fantasy_xiv_2009_10_08_09_19.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4086/1166042-final_fantasy_xiv_2009_10_08_09_19.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>A Blacksmith</figcaption></figure><p style="">The Armoury is a system vaguely reminiscent the <a href="/job-system/3015-298" data-ref-id="3015-298">job system</a> used in previous Final Fantasy games. Rather than gaining experience and levels, however, this <a href="">class</a> system is tied to weapons. Each weapon type represents a different character class (for example, if your character picks up a one-handed sword, he becomes a <a href="">Gladiator</a>). Selecting a weapon will grant you basic abilities for the class tied to it. As you fight with that weapon and use the class abilities it grants, your skill with the weapon will increase, granting you new abilities. At any time, you can change your weapon, switching classes in the process. For example, you've been carrying a staff since the start of your adventuring career and you've earned powerful skill as a Conjurer. Deciding to learn the way of the sword, you put your staff away and pull out a longsword. Now you can use your sword for basic attacks, and as you increase in skill, learn more powerful sword-based attacks. And, while using your sword, you can still cast most spells you learned as a Conjurer. Put the sword away and take out your staff, and you're once again a Conjurer.</p><h3>Disciplines</h3><p style="">Disciplines are the different paths of activity and skill that an adventurer may devote himself to. Using the Armoury system, one may switch between classes under all disciplines.</p><h4>Disciples of War</h4><p style=""><strong>Archer (Job Advancement: Bard)</strong></p><p style="">The <a href="/archer/3015-3355" data-ref-id="3015-3355">Archer</a> is a ranged combat specialist, highly skilled with the <a href="">bow</a> and able to fall back on slings and rocks if they run out of arrows. Traditionally, the <a href="/elezen/3015-4930" data-ref-id="3015-4930">Elezen</a> and <a href="/miqote/3015-4931" data-ref-id="3015-4931">Miqo'te</a> are considered to be the most skillful Archers. Effectiveness with this class will depend on a player's expertise in positioning and arrow-type selection.</p><p style=""><strong>Lancer (Job Advancement: Dragoon)</strong></p><p style="">The Lancer is a melee fighter skilled at using <a href="">polearm</a> weapons such as lances and pikes. Able to attack from a relatively safe distance due to the length of their weapon, lancers are also skilled at throwing javelins at long range. These abilities make them an ideal combat support class.</p><p style=""><strong>Gladiator (Job Advancement: Paladin)</strong></p><p style="">Gladiators are skilled in the use of all one-handed blades, including both melee weapons and <a href="">throwing knives</a>. They can either use shields in their off hand or focus all their energy on their sword arm. A Gladiator is a great front-line fighter and defender, with the ability to hold an enemy's attention.</p><p style=""><strong>Marauder (Job Advancement: Warrior)</strong></p><p style="">A combat specialist focusing on the two-handed <a href="">great-axe</a>, the marauder is a fearsome fighter who is able to supplement their arsenal with throwing axes. Brute force is their greatest attribute, and timing and distance will be essential to their effectiveness in combat.</p><p style=""><strong>Pugilist (Job Advancement: Monk)</strong></p><p style="">This master of close-combat is formidable even when unarmed, but they are known to use different types of <a href="">fist</a> weapons to augment their arsenal. The Pugilist can alter their stance to focus on either attack or defense, and counter their lack of range with excellent maneuverability.</p><p style=""><strong>Rogue (Job Advancement: Ninja)</strong></p><p style="">Available in the upcoming 2.4 patch, Rogues specialize in dual-welding weapons. Armed with daggers and knives, the Rogue is able to dish out the fastest damage possible.

The city is actually placed on many different islands or man-made formations known as sea stacks. Bridges span across each island in a kind of latticework pattern; a sight so beautiful, bards have named it "The Navigator's Veil." The goddess Llymlaen is said to have blessed Limsa Lominsa because she took pity on the sailors of a great armada that had to flee from battle. The rocks destroyed their ships and with no means to travel and no home to return to they settled in the islands using the remaining vessels that they had to begin construction. The people of Limsa Lominsa did not forget their old ways, but merely gathered strength to rebuild and adventure out again.

A forest city-state located in Eorzea. A story in Eorzean history, "Tales of Bridges," describes Ishgard.</p><h2>Travel</h2><h3><a href="">Aetheryte</a></h3><p style="">The <a href="/aetheryte/3055-3592" data-ref-id="3055-3592">Aetheryte</a> is the name placed upon the large crystal shards found in the crystallized aetheric mist. They were precisely cut and fused to arcane machinery. These crystals are at the backbone of all everyday teleportation and are found throughout the realm, mainly in the individual city-states in which they are managed and operated. The origins and functions of these crystals is still very much a mystery. It is not known who constructed these crystals or what they were originally used for. Even though they are commonly used for teleportation, the actual process remains unknown. However, some have theorized that when a sentient presence approaches the crystal, it triggers the aether of the crystal and the body resonates with the crystal, breaking down into simple mass which then flows through the invisible aetheric streams of the planet. The person's soul is what actually guides the particles to the pre-determined destination and the crystal reconfigures the mist back into its original form. This is all instantaneous and this make easy travel to the far reaches of the world.</p><p style="">In the original release, teleportation through Aetheryte's was regulated through a concept called Anima. Your character would consume some of this for each teleport taken, and the greater the distance, the greater the Anima consumed. This was replenished at a very slow rate and limited its continuous use. This was abolished in the transition to A Realm Reborn, and now Gil is used for teleportation.</p><h3>Aethernet</h3><p style="">The Athernet is made up of smaller scale Aetheryte crystals inside a city. They are used for quick travel between locations inside the city. As with the larger Aetheryte crystals, you have attune yourself to an Aethernet crystal in order to be able to teleport to that crystal's location.</p><h3><a href="/chocobo/3015-259" data-ref-id="3015-259">Chocobos</a></h3><p style="">One of the character mascots of the Final Fantasy series, Chocobos are available as player mounts within the word of Eorzea. You can either rent a chocobo within the three city-states for Gil, or you can get your own personal Chocobo. You must attain an enlisted rank within one of the three Grand Companies of Eorzea, and have 1,000 Grand Company seals in order to purchase a Chocobo Whistle, which can be used thereafter to call upon your own personal "horsebird". This is usually around character level 25ish.</p><p style="">There are several sets of Barding for your Chocobo available in the game. This changes the look of your Chocobo. There are 3 slots for Barding. (head, body, legs) They are available through reputation grinds (Grand Company), Veteran Rewards or maxing out the spec which is explained below.</p><p style="">When you have your Grand Company Chocobo, you can consume a "Gyshal Greens" item and your chocobo will fight alongside you as a companion. It is considered a party member. Therefore if you and a friend are in a party and each have your Chocobo out, you're unable to invite anyone else.</p><p style="">Once you get your Chocobo. You have 3 options you can "spec" it into. Tank, Healer or DPS. There are 20 Ranks (Levels). The EXP you earn from killing monsters is split with the Chocobo if you have it summoned.

It has been described as an "open-world action adventure" built on <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/frostbite-3-0/3015-7847" data-ref-id="3015-7847">Frostbite</a>.</p><h2>Rumors, Leaks, &amp; Reveal</h2><p style="">On July 12, 2009 a Mirror's Edge game was confirmed by President of <a href="/electronic-arts/3010-1" data-ref-id="3010-1">EA</a> Games Europe Patrick Soderlund as being considered for development, saying</p><blockquote data-align="center" data-size="small"><p style="">"<em>You will see another Mirror's Edge for sure. It's just a matter of when that time is and what we do with it. We have a small team on it and I'm excited about what we do</em>...<em>Mirror's Edge was a risky move. It was a bold move, a very innovative and inspiring move. The game wasn't perfect by any means. We would have liked the game to sell better, even though the game has sold better than most people think</em>."</p></blockquote><p style="">In a February 2011 interview with Vicachu, Soderlund revealed that development work on Mirror's Edge 2 had stalled in favor of other projects, again citing the lack of Mirror's Edge sales as a disincentive for continuing work on the title.</p><p style="">On November 22 2012, <a href="/ben-cousins/3040-93517" data-ref-id="3040-93517">Ben Cousins</a>, the former executive producer of the Battlefield series, mentioned on twitter in regards to DICE working only in the Battlefield games that: "It is general knowledge in the Stockholm dev scene that Mirror's Edge 2 is in production as DICE."</p><p style="">In May 2013, listings for the game briefly appeared on a few European Amazon websites, which were quickly removed. On May 30th, 2013, it was noticed that a help page for Mirror's Edge 2 existed on the EA website itself, but was promptly deleted later that same day.</p><h3>Announcement</h3><p style="">The game was officially announced on June 10th, 2013 at EA's <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/e3-2013/3015-7534" data-ref-id="3015-7534">E3</a> Press Conference. Some gameplay was revealed of Faith fighting masked agents, intercut with her receiving a tattoo on her arm (a tattoo she already has in the original game, suggesting the game is a prequel). The game was announced for PC, Xbox One, and PS4, with no release date given, only that it will come "when it is ready."</p><p style="">On June 12, 2013, Patrick Söderlund explained in an interview that the game will be different compared to the first game. The original game received criticism on how it handled combat situations. Söderlund addressed this by saying: <em>"The first game was a lot about running away from things and, even though you want to have sections with that, you also want Faith... she's a powerful character and you want her to take control. You'll see a little bit more of that in this game.''</em> At the same time, he made sure to explain that the game will not become a shooter saying: <em>"Again, we're not going to turn this into a shooter. On the contrary, in fact. But we are going to evolve Faith and the story. Once we show more of this people will be genuinely excited.

It is a full reboot of the <a href="/tomb-raider/3025-267" data-ref-id="3025-267">Tomb Raider</a> franchise; the game's story, written by <a href="/rhianna-pratchett/3040-42646" data-ref-id="3040-42646">Rhianna Pratchett</a> and <a href="/susan-oconnor/3040-74356" data-ref-id="3040-74356">Susan O'Connor,</a> tells the tale of a young and inexperienced Lara Croft's first adventure. The game was developed by 80% of the team that worked on previous Lara Croft games and features a brand new engine dubbed the Crystal Engine.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Tomb Raider's development was first announced by publisher <a href="/square-enix/3010-104" data-ref-id="3010-104">Square Enix </a>on December 6, 2010. Initially scheduled for Fall 2012, release was pushed after Crystal Dynamics received a directive from Square Enix President <a href="/youichi-wada/3040-48566" data-ref-id="3040-48566">Yoichi Wada </a>to make the best game that they could possibly make. It was finally released on March 5, 2013 to general acclaim.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Like its <a href="/tomb-raider/3025-267" data-ref-id="3025-267">precursors</a>, the new Tomb Raider involves a mix of puzzle solving, platforming and combat in an open world environment. In terms of tone and mechanics, however, the game is more serious and realistic <b>– </b>Lara does not dive in slow motion while using dual pistols with pinpoint lock-on accuracy, but rather <a href="/cover-system/3015-55" data-ref-id="3015-55">takes cover</a> behind the environment and eliminates enemies with a carefully aimed arrow from her bow. Unlike the typical franchise enemy roster, consisting largely of various wild animals, players' opponents in this game are almost universally human, with few exceptions. This decreased diversity is offset by an increased depth to the combat. Lara uses four different ranged weapons, each with its own unlockable upgrades, <a href="/alternate-fire/3015-593" data-ref-id="3015-593">alt-fire mode</a>, and out-of-combat utility. Upgrading weapons requires resources in the form of salvage which can be found in various containers throughout the island or by looting corpses. She can also use salvage to unlock limited close-combat capabilities, being able to dodge and counterattack, as well as perform executions on incapacitated enemies.</p><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-size="small" data-ref-id="1300-2458291" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/130213/2458291-2453624-203160_2013-03-10_00036.png" data-ratio="0.6062925170068" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:60.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/130213/2458291-2453624-203160_2013-03-10_00036.png" data-ref-id="1300-2458291"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/130213/2458291-2453624-203160_2013-03-10_00036.png"></a><figcaption>Action-packed sequences abound.</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Tomb Raider's platforming follows in the vein of the <a href="/uncharted/3025-957" data-ref-id="3025-957">Uncharted </a>series, with cinematic set-pieces and dynamic features, as well as limited use of <a href="/quick-time-event/3015-6" data-ref-id="3015-6">quick-time events</a>. These set-pieces led to some initial negative publicity for the game (the first in the franchise to receive an 'M' ESRB rating), as failure frequently results in gruesome, fully-animated deaths, such as being impaled through the chin or crushed under a boulder. Increased control over jumps and the ability to scramble up walls, among other enhancements, make the platforming feel more polished mechanically than previously in the franchise. Puzzle-solving is also a more active process, as Lara must take into account variable elements such as fire, wind, and momentum. To aid her, Lara can activate her "<a href="/detective-mode/3015-6244" data-ref-id="3015-6244">Survival Instinct</a>" at any time while standing still, which will highlight objectives, enemies, collectibles, and interactive elements.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Base Camps allow Lara to <a href="/fast-travel/3015-676" data-ref-id="3015-676">fast travel</a> across the island. These camps are also where the player upgrades Lara's skills and weapons. Use of fast travel is essential for getting all the <a href="/collectibles/3015-375" data-ref-id="3015-375">collectibles</a>, as many are hidden or blocked behind obstacles that Lara obtains the tools to overcome later in the game. These collectibles include journals from past island inhabitants and the Endurance crew, relics reflecting the island's legacy, and GPS markers which reveal hidden caches. They can be found through exploration, by use of Survival Instinct, or by clearing each area's tomb to retrieve the treasure map at the end.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure style="width: 480px" data-align="left" data-size="medium" data-ref-id="1300-2603725" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/18/189230/2603725-2013-05-13_00006.jpg" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/18/189230/2603725-2013-05-13_00006.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2603725"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/18/189230/2603725-2013-05-13_00006.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/18/189230/2603725-2013-05-13_00006.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Don't look down.</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Travelling aboard the <em>Endurance</em>, Lara and her boss, archaeologist <a href="/dr-james-jim-whitman/3005-25670" data-ref-id="3005-25670">Dr. James Whitman</a>, are seeking the ruins of the legendary island of Yamatai, which was ruled by the shamanistic Sun Queen, Himiko. Accompanying Lara is the <em>Endurance</em>'s captain, Lara's mentor <a href="/conrad-roth/3005-25139" data-ref-id="3005-25139">Conrad Roth</a>, as well as her friend of Japanese descent, Samantha, who is fascinated by the story of Himiko. For Lara, the quest is inherited from her father, also an archaeologist, while for Dr. Whitman the primary appeal is as material for a TV series. Against Dr. Whitman's wishes, they follow Lara's hunch that Yamatai is to be found in the Dragon's Triangle, an infamously stormy and dangerous area of the ocean southeast of Japan. The Endurance is caught in a raging squall and shipwrecked on a mysterious island. The survivors soon encounter a band of homicidal madmen, and are split up in the ensuing melee. Most of the game focuses on Lara's journeys across the island to reunite with and rescue her friends, and find a way home. Early on, she manages to send an SOS message, and a plane arrives to evacuate the survivors. However, a freak localized storm forms and strikes the plane from the sky</p><figure style="width: 480px" data-align="right" data-size="medium" data-ref-id="1300-2458801" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/130213/2458801-2453469-203160_2013-03-09_00011.png" data-ratio="0.64360587002096" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:64.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/130213/2458801-2453469-203160_2013-03-09_00011.png" data-ref-id="1300-2458801"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/130213/2458801-2453469-203160_2013-03-09_00011.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/130213/2458801-2453469-203160_2013-03-09_00011.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Trial by fire.</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">As she fights the hostile inhabitants of Yamatai, it is revealed that they are a fanatical cult, led by the ruthless and insane <a href="/father-mathias/3005-25906" data-ref-id="3005-25906">Father Mathias</a>, who was stranded there in 1982. As more people are shipwrecked by the Dragon Triangle's storms, the men are captured, tortured, and indoctrinated into the Solarii, the warrior core of the cult. The women, however, can be found crucified and burned to death across the island in some twisted ritual. Lara eventually reunites with most of her companions, including Joslin Reyes, the mechanic, who is repairing an escape boat, but discovers that Samantha has been abducted by Mathias for a sinister purpose. Pursuing him into the island's ancient temple, Lara discovers that the storms that surround Yamatai are caused by Himiko's vengeful spirit, still trapped in her ancient corpse. Mathias believes if they offer Himiko a "living successor", she'll stop the storms and allow them to escape. However, the ritual for the transferal of power involves a trial by fire, which every woman thus far has failed. Samantha miraculously survives the trial, and Mathias takes her into the inner sanctum to continue the ritual. This angers the Guardians, magically preserved but mindless soldiers of Yamatai who defend Himiko's remains. Lara fights her way through both Solarii and Guardians to finally reach Mathias and Samantha in the midst of the transference process. There, Lara finally learns the secret that Mathias knew but she didn't. Namely, that Himiko was a sorceress who cheated death by stealing the bodies of young women as she grew old again and again; the last 'successor to the throne' learned of this ahead of time and poisoned herself during the ritual, so that Himiko's evil soul was trapped in the girl's dead body. Mathias intends to sacrifice Sam to Himiko, giving Himiko the living Sam's body, killing Sam in the process. Therefore, to save her friend, Lara kills Mathias (finally wielding her trademark dual pistols) and torches Himiko's body, sending the witch-queen to Hell once and for all.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">With the storms finally eliminated, Lara and Samantha escape with what few companions survive (only Reyes and Jonah, the galley master). They are picked up by a passing ship, and given the opportunity to go back home. However, traumatized by her experiences, Lara now believes that she is an adventurer at heart, and there are many more questions that need answering.

The film's script was created by legendary Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, who died in September of 1998; the film was slated to be his son Hisao Kurosawa's directorial debut.  At the 2005 Tokyo Game Show, <a data-ref-id="3010-94" href="/koei-co-ltd/3010-94">  Koei</a> announced that the film was canceled due to complications, but also stated that production of the game was still underway.  Following this announcement, no new information about the game was released until a year later with the debut of a new trailer at TGS 2006. <br /> <br />Following TGS, Koei remained silent on the game's status until the April 2009 issue of Famitsu revealed that Ni-Oh was still in development.  At <a data-ref-id="3015-5385" href="/tokyo-game-show-2010/3015-5385">    TGS 2010</a>, it was revealed that development of the game has been handed off to <a data-ref-id="3010-1764" href="/team-ninja/3010-1764">       Team Ninja</a>, the development studio under Koei's corporate partner <a data-ref-id="3010-7421" href="/tecmo/3010-7421"> Tecmo</a> responsible for the <a data-ref-id="3025-135" href="/dead-or-alive/3025-135">      Dead or Alive</a> and <a data-ref-id="3025-472" href="/ninja-gaiden/3025-472">     Ninja Gaiden</a> series.]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year>2016</expected_release_year><id>27578</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/1/13158/1094808-gb.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/13158/1094808-gb.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/1/13158/1094808-gb.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/13158/1094808-gb.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/13158/1094808-gb.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/13158/1094808-gb.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/1/13158/1094808-gb.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Ni-Oh]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating/><original_release_date/><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/]]></api_detail_url><id>146</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 4]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS4]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/ni-oh/3030-27578/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-27668/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2009-08-04 08:06:58</date_added><date_last_updated>2016-01-02 10:29:02</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[From the creator of Braid, The Witness is an exploration-focused puzzle game that takes place on an uninhabited island.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The Witness will be a <a href="/first-person-perspective/3015-330" data-ref-id="3015-330">first-person</a> adventure/puzzle game where players must explore a large uninhabited island, solving puzzles in order to progress further into the game. <a href="/jonathan-blow/3040-89596" data-ref-id="3040-89596">Jonathan Blow</a> (the creator of <a href="/braid/3030-20716" data-ref-id="3030-20716">Braid</a>) is the project lead on the game.

and a quirky companion named Fidget, seeks to free a village from oppression while uncovering the truth behind his past.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Dust: An Elysian Tail is a two-dimensional side-scrolling action role-playing game developed by <a href="/dean-dodrill/3040-19566" data-ref-id="3040-19566">Dean Dodrill</a>. Dodrill is the sole developer and has hand-animated and coded the game by himself, with HyperDuck Music Studios contributing the music. The game itself is a tie-in to <i>Elysian Tail</i>, an animated feature also being worked on by Dodrill. Previously Dust was being made as an <a href="/xbox-live-indie-games/3015-2533" data-ref-id="3015-2533">Xbox Live Indie Game</a> after winning Dream.Build.Play 2009, an annual contest held by <a href="/microsoft-studios/3010-340" data-ref-id="3010-340">Microsoft</a> to highlight quality independent games, however on July 7th, 2010, Dodrill announced that Microsoft will be publishing it as an official <a href="/xbox-live-marketplace/3045-86" data-ref-id="3045-86">Xbox Live Arcade</a> title. Very little was heard about Dust for the next two years, until it was announced in June 2012 that the game was going to be part of the 2012 <a href="/summer-of-arcade/3015-7039" data-ref-id="3015-7039">Xbox Live Summer of Arcade</a> promotion. Additionally, at a PAX East 2013 panel, creators Dean Dodrill and Alex Kain announced that the game would see a release on <a href="/steam/3015-718" data-ref-id="3015-718">Steam</a> within the next few months.</p><p style="">The game was finally released on August 15, 2012 for 1200 <a href="/microsoft-points/3015-5685" data-ref-id="3015-5685">Microsoft Points</a> (the equivalent of $15.00 USD), and quickly garnered critical acclaim from numerous publications, including top scores from <i>Electronic Gaming Monthly</i>, <i>Official Xbox Magazine,</i> Games Radar, and <i>Game Informer</i>. The game has been praised for its art style, simplistic yet addicting gameplay, and its large world, with frequent comparisons to the "<a href="/metroidvania/3015-2440" data-ref-id="3015-2440">Metroidvania</a>" style.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Combat</h3><p style="">At its core, Dust: An Elysian Tail is a <a href="/hack-and-slash/3015-469" data-ref-id="3015-469">hack-and-slash</a> game. Its protagonist, <a href="/dust/3005-24144" data-ref-id="3005-24144">Dust</a>, is able to perform combos using his talking sword of Ahrah and his sidekick <a href="/fidget/3005-24143" data-ref-id="3005-24143">Fidget</a> (who is a "nimbat," a flying creature similar to a mongoose or a ferret, and an oft-parodied aspect in some portions of the game). Dust is able to acquire more abilities as the game progresses, opening up combat to longer and more complex combos. One early such acquisition is the Dust Storm, a special attack that allows Dust to spin his sword quickly, hitting enemies dozens of times in the span of a few seconds.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1127085-still_06.png" data-ref-id="1300-1127085" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1127085-still_06.png" data-ref-id="1300-1127085"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33529/1127085-still_06.png"></a><figcaption>Longer combos give Dust more experience.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The <a href="/combo/3015-18" data-ref-id="3015-18">combo</a> system of Dust's combat is also part of the role-playing aspect of the game. Longer combos yields higher <a href="/experience-points/3015-39" data-ref-id="3015-39">experience point</a> bonuses, and thus, more frequent level ups for Dust. These experience bonuses disappear if Dust takes any damage, however, so maintaining a bonus is increasingly difficult as combat progresses. <a href="/leveling-up/3015-475" data-ref-id="3015-475">Leveling up</a> grants Dust a Skill Gem, which can be placed in one of four <a href="/attributes/3015-1681" data-ref-id="3015-1681">attributes</a>: Health, Attack, Defense, and Fidget (which also upgrades the Dust Storm ability). The highest of the four attributes cannot be raised more than 4 points above the lowest, limiting <a href="/min-maxing/3015-128" data-ref-id="3015-128">min-maxing</a>.</p><p style="">In addition to all of Dust's combat abilities, Fidget can also play a role in the game's battles. She can fire small <a href="/projectiles/3015-3" data-ref-id="3015-3">projectiles</a> at enemies, damaging them slightly. However, when used in conjunction with the Dust Storm ability, Fidget's small projectiles are multiplied exponentially, and can deal greater damage and even produce more projectiles.</p><p style="">Every one of these special actions (Fidget's abilities, Dust's special abilities such as dashing, Dust Storm, etc) expend amounts of Dust's Energy Meter. When empty, attempting to use the Dust Storm can even damage Dust slightly. The meter automatically refills slowly over time, but can also be more quickly refilled by attacking enemies with regular attacks and building up a combo chain.</p><p style="">Challenge Arenas are special areas hidden throughout the game's world. In these arenas, players must traverse a course under a time limit, avoiding obstacles and traps, fighting enemies, and breaking certain markers to boost point totals. Defeating enemies and breaking lamps add points, while taking damage from enemies or traps docks points. At the end of the course, the player's total number of accrued points is recorded as their score, which, if high enough, will earn a special reward item. Each Challenge Arena can be scored up to four stars, with a three star score or better unlocking that arena's item. This is also serves as the game's <a href="/leaderboard/3015-30" data-ref-id="3015-30">leaderboard</a>.</p><h3>Quests, Exploration, and Interaction</h3><p style="">Beyond combat, there are several other things to interact with in the world of Falana. Dust can talk with <a href="/non-player-character/3015-967" data-ref-id="3015-967">non-player characters</a>, many of which have <a href="/side-quests/3015-338" data-ref-id="3015-338">side quests</a> for Dust to fulfill (earning experience and items as reward). These non-player characters typically appear in the game's many towns, and many of them unlock new areas to explore. Exploration is fairly non-linear, but differs from the typical Metroidvania style in that traversing from one area to another requires an intermediary visit to a world map instead of direct connection.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/88760/2293522-dustyhands.png" data-ref-id="1300-2293522" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.50978260869565" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:51.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/88760/2293522-dustyhands.png" data-ref-id="1300-2293522"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/88760/2293522-dustyhands.png"></a><figcaption>Non-player interaction can sometimes open up new side quests.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Within these areas there are typically several <a href="/treasure-chest/3055-517" data-ref-id="3055-517">treasure chests</a> to find and unlock. Every chest requires a generic key to open as well as successfully performing a simple <a href="/minigames/3015-116" data-ref-id="3015-116">minigame</a>. In reward, chests provide Dust with money, <a href="/crafting/3015-934" data-ref-id="3015-934">crafting</a> materials, healing items, and blueprints. These <a href="/blueprint/3055-3893" data-ref-id="3055-3893">blueprints</a>, which can also be dropped as <a href="/random-loot/3015-365" data-ref-id="3015-365">random loot</a> from defeated enemies, make new equipment available at blacksmiths, where Dust can spend crafting materials and money to create special weapons, rings, pendants, augments, or armor.</p><p style="">Crafting materials can be obtained in a few other ways beyond opening chests. Enemies frequently drop crafting materials, which differ based on location and enemy. Shops stock crafting materials as well, but only stock materials which have previously been sold by the player (requiring the player to sell at least one of a certain material before that material will be stocked in a store). This is carried over across all shops, so selling materials at one shop will also unlocked that material for purchase in every other shop.</p><p style="">In addition to the regular chests hidden around the world, there are twelve cages, each requiring four keys to unlock (and a slightly more difficult version of the standard chest-unlocking minigame). Each of these twelve cages holds a character from another indie game, including <a href="/meat-boy/3005-10939" data-ref-id="3005-10939">Meat Boy</a>, <a href="/the-kid/3005-16447" data-ref-id="3005-16447">The Kid</a>, and <a href="/the-maw/3005-9374" data-ref-id="3005-9374">The Maw</a>. After unlocking a cage, the character (referred to in-game as a "Friend") is sent to the Sanctuary, a location accesible via the world map where all of the obtained friends are stored. Dust's maximum health total is increased by 5% for each Friend that has been rescued.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style="">The game opens with the protagonist waking up in the middle of a forest to a talking sword. The sword (who introduces himself as the Blade of Ahrah) explains that his name is <a href="/dust/3005-24144" data-ref-id="3005-24144">Dust</a>, and that he summoned the sword. The two are joined by <a href="/fidget/3005-24143" data-ref-id="3005-24143">Fidget</a>, a small flying fox-like creature, and the guardian of the aforementioned sword, and the three of them decide to set out on a quest to discover what is Dust's true identity.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1127075-dust_02.png" data-ref-id="1300-1127075" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.97806580259222" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:97.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1127075-dust_02.png" data-ref-id="1300-1127075"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33529/1127075-dust_02.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33529/1127075-dust_02.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Dust and Fidget stand with Ginger</figcaption></figure><p style="">The trio set off for the nearest town of Aurora, where they find that the town is being overrun by monsters. The mayor of the town (Mayor Bram) asks Dust for his help, and he abides, defeating Fuse, a crazed monster who razed a nearby village. Fuse has a brief moment of lucidity before his death and reveals himself as one of a race of creatures known as Moonbloods, creatures who are victims of a genocide perpetrated by a mysterious character known as General Gaius. Fuse also tells Dust that he played a role in the genocide at some point.</p><p style="">Mayor Bram instructs Dust to speak to a woman in Aurora named Ginger, who may have more knowledge of the Moonbloods. She is revealed to be part of a group of Moonblood sympathizers, a group that was recently found and killed by General Gaius' men. Ginger tells Dust that she is headed to some mountains in the north, as water has stopped flowing in the town of Aurora for some mysterious reason.</p><p style="">Dust manages to restart the flow of water by traveling beneath the town and defeating a deity in control of the water flow, who says that General Gaius' troops are marching in the north. Concerned for Ginger's safety, Dust heads north to meet up with her, and there he finds Ginger and Elder Gray Eyes, as well as the truth of his identity. Gray Eyes reveals that Dust was created by the Moonbloods from two persons who perished simultaneously: Jin (Ginger's brother) and Cassius (a powerful assassin working with Gaius). These two were complete opposites, one purely evil and one completely innocent and good, combined together into what the Moonbloods call "Sen-Mithrarin."</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/2296129-blackmoor_mountain.png" data-ref-id="1300-2296129" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.56309523809524" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/2296129-blackmoor_mountain.png" data-ref-id="1300-2296129"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/2296129-blackmoor_mountain.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/2296129-blackmoor_mountain.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Dust faces Gaius' troops on top of Everdawn Basin.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The group head to the Moonblood base in a northern volcano named Everdawn Basin, where Dust assists the Moonbloods in fighting back Gaius' troops. Reaching the peak, Dust fights General Gaius in a lengthy struggle. Eventually, Gaius is hanging from an outcrop over a pool of lava, where he tells Dust that Cassius is no longer part of him, then flings himself into the lava. Dust, severely injured from the preceding fight, collapses as Fidget begs him to wake up. After calmly explaining that it is simply his time, Dust and Fidget say goodbye, and Dust closes his eyes, allowing the rising lava to wash over him.</p><p style="">The game ends as Elder Gray Eyes is giving a speech to the Moonbloods, telling them that through Dust's sacrifice they are able to live in a better world. However, as the cutscene draws to a close, a flash of light as the Blade of Ahrah flies off - encased in a cloud of dust the same colour as Dust's fur - insinuates that Dust may very well still be alive.</p><p style=""> </p><h2>Music</h2><p style="">The sounds and music for Dust: An Elysian Tail was composed by HyperDuck SoundWorks (Chris Geehan and Dan Byrne-McCullough) with additional music from Alex Brandon.

Though like most survival horror titles, Resident Evil limits the player character's capabilities beyond the norm and ammunition for their firearms is generally scarce, intended to force players to use their supplies wisely and to choose flight rather than fight when possible. There are three different difficulty modes available: Easy, Normal, and Hard, with each one featuring tougher enemies and less ammunition to be found than the last.</p><p style="">Utilising the notorious ''<a href="/tank-controls/3015-4647" data-ref-id="3015-4647">tank controls</a>'', players move via a third person perspective throughout a number of pre-determined camera angles. Characters also cannot move and fire their weapons at the same time, and instead the character will 'perch' themselves to the ground when aiming. And while the camera angle perspective sometimes tends to purposely obfuscate the players view of monsters, characters will at least (by default) aim their weapon at the closest enemy when players draw their gun. What is new over the original Resident Evil is the ability to now do an 180 degree turn, which was first introduced in <a href="/resident-evil-3-nemesis/3030-5587" data-ref-id="3030-5587">Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</a> and has continued as a mainstay across the series since then.</p><p style="">While the game follows a linear pattern of major events, the player is allowed to explore most of the beginning mansion at will. Many of the puzzles and necessary key items required to move on can be solved/collected in any order.</p><p style="">The story is largely portrayed via in-game cutscenes, however there are also a number of Files (diaries, memos ect.) players can collect. These will often provide additional insight into the goings on across the overall narrative, but some are more vital as they will provide information pertaining to solving puzzles or maybe hinting as to where to go next.</p><h3>Playable Characters</h3><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8497/236034-character_select2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-236034" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8497/236034-character_select2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-236034"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8497/236034-character_select2.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8497/236034-character_select2.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Chris Redfield</figcaption></figure><p style="">Like the original, Resident Evil features two different characters--Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine--to select from. Each offers up a differing take on the same narrative, though what separates them the most is the gameplay implications, as Jill Valentine's version of the game is significantly easier and more accessible than Chris's.</p><p style="">Jill has more inventory space to carry items; she can potentially find an additional weapon exclusive only to her story, being the grenade launcher; she has with her a lockpick that can open locked drawers; and many more such examples. However Chris is somewhat sturdier than Jill and can withstand more damage before succumbing to death, and he also has better accuracy with handguns giving players the increased chance to pop a zombie's head completely just with one shot.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8497/236033-character_select1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-236033" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8497/236033-character_select1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-236033"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8497/236033-character_select1.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8497/236033-character_select1.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Jill Valentine</figcaption></figure><p style="">Each character also has their own unique supporting character that they will often encounter and interact with during the game.

During Chris' story, however, players may take control of Rebecca Chambers on two separate occasions to help save Chris from dying of poison, and to kill the mutated plant monster Plant 42.</p><h3>Inventory</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661793-resident_evil_directors_cut_psx_21.png" data-ref-id="1300-2661793" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="300" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 300px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661793-resident_evil_directors_cut_psx_21.png" data-ref-id="1300-2661793"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661793-resident_evil_directors_cut_psx_21.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661793-resident_evil_directors_cut_psx_21.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Chris Redfield's 6-slot inventory screen</figcaption></figure><p style="">Depending on which character the player chooses, they will either have six (Chris) or eight (Jill) inventory slots in total. Each type of item requires only one slot, however. Each character also one additional slot strictly to house a unique item; Chris possesses a lighter, and Jill has a lockpick. Besides the character's inventory, there also exist a number of <a href="/item-box/3055-6126" data-ref-id="3055-6126">item boxes</a> where players can store unwanted items. Item boxes are often located within save rooms (though not always) and items will persist throughout all item boxes across the game.</p><p style="">All items and weapons can be examined by the player, allowing them to get a closer look and turn the object around. This can sometimes change the properties of certain key items, such as unlocking/opening a key item to reveal another inside, or may at least change the title to reflect the item's true identity.</p><h3>Self-Defense Items</h3><p style="">One notable feature exclusive to the remake is the addition of self-defense items. Given a separate inventory slot, there are three different self-defense items that players may find and then equip. Once one is equipped, from that point when a player is grabbed by an enemy, the player can then press the firing button which will then show the character using the self-defense item to escape the grab, canceling out any possible damage inflicted upon the character. All self-defense items are one use only, however.</p><p style="">There are three different self-defense items, one of which can be found by both characters, and one unique item for each:</p><ul><li><b>Daggers</b> - Can be found during both Chris and Jill's and will inflict moderate damage unto an enemy. There's a small chance that when the enemy has been shot, the dagger will fall onto the ground and can be collected once again by the player.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Flashbang</b> - Chris' exclusive self-defense item, Chris will shove the flashbang into the attacking enemy's mouth and, once shot by the player, will explode killing the creature completely.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Taser</b> - Jill's exclusive self-defense item, Jill will pull out the taser and then zap the enemy doing a high amount of damage. It will kill a zombie outright, though sturdier enemies such as hunters can sometimes manage to survive the current.</li></ul><h3>Health &amp; Herbs/First Aid Sprays</h3><p style="">A character's health can be seen via the inventory menu, with an Electrocardiograph Machine showing a character's status. The different statuses are:</p><ul><li><strong>Fine</strong> - The character is in good health.</li><li><strong>Caution</strong> - The character is roughly at half health.</li><li><strong>Danger</strong> - The character is approaching death.</li><li><strong>Poison</strong> - The character is poisoned and their health will slowly deplete.</li></ul><p style="">Besides the EKG, players may also note the character's stance. Whence the characters starts holding onto their hip, that is a sign that their health is at least in the Caution state, or may even be poisoned.</p><p style="">Carrying the tradition set by the original Resident Evil, characters use a small variety of <a href="/medical-herb/3055-566" data-ref-id="3055-566">herb</a>s to heal themselves and cure poisons. <a href="/first-aid-spray/3055-619" data-ref-id="3055-619">First Aid Spray</a>s are also available, though they only have the singular purpose of healing the character fully. There exist three herb types, all of which can be combined in some way for different degrees of healing:</p><ul><li><b>Green Herb</b> - On its own will restore 25% of health.</li><li><b>Blue Herb</b> - On its own will cure poison, though will not restore any health.</li><li><b>Red Herb</b> - On its own does nothing.</li><li><b>Green + Green Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character by roughly 50% of health.</li><li><b>Green + Green + Green Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character completely, though not of any poisons.</li><li><b>Green + Blue Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character 25% of health and cure any poison.</li><li><b>Green + Green + Blue Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character 50% of health and cure any poison.</li><li><b>Green + Red Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character completely, though not of any poisons.</li><li><b>Green + Red + Blue Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character completely including poisons.</li><li><b>Red + Blue Herb</b> - Mixed will do nothing.</li></ul><h3>Saving</h3><p style="">Like every other main Resident Evil game pre-Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil requires that players find one of the many typewriters located throughout the environments to save, and must also have at least one ink ribbon item in their character's inventory.</p><h2>Story</h2><h3>Main Characters</h3><h4><a href="/chris-redfield/3005-413" data-ref-id="3005-413">Chris Redfield</a></h4><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8497/236303-character_chris.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-236303" data-size="small" data-ratio="2" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:200.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8497/236303-character_chris.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-236303"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8497/236303-character_chris.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8497/236303-character_chris.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">One of the two main playable characters, Chris is the S.T.A.R.S.

The primary difference between the two is which characters are featured and what their role is. For Chris Redfield's story, he works alongside Rebecca Chambers amidst their attempts to survive the Mansion, whereas Jill Valentine has Barry Burton as her supporting character. However, both Rebecca and Barry do not appear in the other character's campaigns; Barry will at least still show up in the opening cutscene during Chris's story, but then disappears completely and isn't encountered again. And Rebecca Chambers is omitted from Jill Valentine's story completely.</p><p style="">Whichever of the two main characters the player selects, the other is then also absent from the majority of the game until the very end. The canon telling of the game's story is made up of varying factors of both interpretations, however, including the involvement of both Rebecca Chambers and Barry Burton.</p><h3>Plot</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661819-dolphin-2012-09-27-00-31-23-08.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661819" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661819-dolphin-2012-09-27-00-31-23-08.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661819"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661819-dolphin-2012-09-27-00-31-23-08.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661819-dolphin-2012-09-27-00-31-23-08.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Barry, Wesker, and Jill</figcaption></figure><p style="">When the police received report of grisly murder cases happening in <a href="/arklay-mountains/3035-387" data-ref-id="3035-387">Arklay Mountains</a>, a group called Bravo Team of <a href="/special-tactics-and-rescue-service/3015-1450" data-ref-id="3015-1450">S.T.A.R.S.</a> is sent to investigate the report in 23th July, 1998; the group is formed by <a href="/enrico-marini/3005-3885" data-ref-id="3005-3885">Enrico Marini</a>, <a href="/rebecca-chambers/3005-1306" data-ref-id="3005-1306">Rebecca Chambers</a>, <a href="/kenneth-j-sullivan/3005-3136" data-ref-id="3005-3136">Kenneth J.

As S.T.A.R.S. travel throughout more of the mansion, and the nearby residence building, they soon learn that this mansion is owned by one Ozwell E.

Though he has now decided to move on from Umbrella to continue his own nefarious ambitions, and only brought in his own S.T.A.R.S. team so as to collect combat data; he was also blackmailing Barry Burton by way of his family so as to lead the other S.T.A.R.S. members astray, though Barry will eventually break free of Wesker's hold and save his compatriots. Wesker himself is seemingly killed by his own creation the T-002 Tyrant--a hulking monster with a large, imposing claw--after he releases it to kill the remaining S.T.A.R.S. members. The team are then able to successfully kill the creature, place a bomb in the laboratory, and escape the resulting explosion via helicopter piloted by Brad Vickers, who had abandoned the team during the beginning in the forest once the undead dogs shown up.</p><h3>Alternate Endings</h3><p style="">Not only depending on which main character the player chooses, the endings of the game can also be determined by specific choices made throughout the game based on which characters manage to survive.</p><p style="">During Chris's story once the player returns to the Mansion after exploring the Residential building, Rebecca is forced into an encounter with a Hunter and screams for help; if the player can't reach her quick enough, she will die. If she survives, then Rebecca will able to set the bomb to destroy the mansion, triggering the resurgence of Tyrant on the Helipad. It'll slowly advance towards Rebecca and if the player isn't able to pull his attention away from her, it'll kill her instantly. Jill Valentine can also be left behind (and potentially killed for certain if Rebecca is still alive by that point) if the player isn't able to find the three MO discs required to unlock the door to her cell, and vice versa when playing as Jill herself.</p><p style="">During Jill's story amidst the Lisa Trevor boss battle, Barry Burton pulls his gun on Jill with what is insinuated to be the intent to kill her. During his hesitation, Jill swiftly pulls the gun from him and directs it back at him. However as Lisa Trevor closes in, Barry pleads that Jill hands him his gun. From here the player has the choice of giving it to him or not; if not, Barry will be killed. If so, then he will fight alongside Jill against Lisa. Though Barry may still be killed during this fight if Lisa gets close enough to knock him off into the chasm below.</p><p style="">If Barry survives the encounter, which sets in the motion the outcome of Wesker escaping and setting the Mansion to self-destruct, this triggers the ambush by Tyrant on the Helipad. It'll then slowly advance towards Barry and if the player isn't able to pull his attention from him, it'll kill Barry instantly.</p><p style="">Overall there are technically eight endings in total dependant on which combination of characters managed to survive the Mansion Incident, which also affects other such outcomes including whether or not the Mansion is destroyed.</p><p style=""><b>Chris' Story</b>:</p><ol><li>Chris, Rebecca, and Jill survive; Albert Wesker is killed; the Spencer Mansion is destroyed.</li><li>Chris and Jill survive; Albert Wesker is killed; the Spencer Mansion is left as it is along with Tyrant.</li><li>Chris and Rebecca survive; Albert Wesker is killed; the Spencer Mansion is destroyed.</li><li>Chris survives; Albert Wesker is killed; the Spencer Mansion is left as it is along with Tyrant.</li></ol><p style=""><b>Jill's story:</b></p><ol><li>Jill, Barry, and Chris survive; Albert Wesker escapes; the Spencer Mansion is destroyed.</li><li>Jill and Chris survive; Albert Wesker is killed; the Spencer Mansion is left as it is along with Tyrant.</li><li>Jill and Barry survive; Albert Wesker escapes; the Spencer Mansion is destroyed.</li><li>Jill survives; Albert Wesker is killed; the Spencer Mansion is left as it is along with Tyrant.</li></ol><p style="">The canon ending of Resident Evil is again made up of varying factors across both stories, including the survival of Chris, Jill, Barry, and Rebecca, the destruction of the Mansion, Wesker's supposed 'death, and the hatred Wesker grows for Chris.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><h3>Survival Knife</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661782-survivalknifechriss.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661782" data-ratio="0.8" data-width="100" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 100px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661782-survivalknifechriss.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661782"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661782-survivalknifechriss.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661782-survivalknifechriss.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Considered to be a last resort tactic, the knife does very little damage and has dangerously small reach. Because of its low effectiveness, it is usually best for the player to just run or attempt to avoid the enemy rather than combat it. Both Chris and Jill have their own different style of knife, though the differences are purely cosmetic.</p><h3>Beretta 92F</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661783-handgun.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661783" data-ratio="0.8" data-width="100" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 100px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661783-handgun.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661783"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661783-handgun.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661783-handgun.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Jill Valentine's starting handgun, which Chris Redfield also eventually procures as his pistol as he lost it in the forest. The beretta is the weapon of choice to handle lesser enemies such as zombies and Cerberus dogs. When playing as Chris Redfield, the player has the chance to kill an enemy just with one shot, courtesy of Chris's skills in marksmanship.</p><h3>Colt Python</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661785-magnumrevolver.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661785" data-ratio="0.8" data-width="100" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 100px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661785-magnumrevolver.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661785"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661785-magnumrevolver.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661785-magnumrevolver.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Returning from the original is the Python Magnum Revolver. Simply massive in size, the Python is the third most powerful weapon in the game behind the Rocket Launcher and the Defense Gun. It can kill all lesser enemies just with one shot and is a reliable contender against boss battles. Though as one may expect, ammunition is terribly scarce.</p><h3>Colt Anaconda</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661786-barrys44magnum.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661786" data-ratio="0.8" data-width="100" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 100px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661786-barrys44magnum.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661786"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661786-barrys44magnum.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661786-barrys44magnum.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Barry Burton's own custom magnum revolver, the Anaconda is pretty much the exact same weapon in both power and appearance as the Python. It can also only be attained during Jill Valentine's story, and even then only if the player decides against giving Barry his gun back during the Lisa Trevor boss battle. However, the magnum ammo players find throughout the mansion isn't compatible with the Anaconda and as such becomes useless once all of its six rounds are used up.</p><h3>Self-Defense Gun</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661787-selfdefensegun.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661787" data-ratio="0.8" data-width="100" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 100px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661787-selfdefensegun.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661787"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661787-selfdefensegun.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661787-selfdefensegun.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">A small two-shot pistol, though with only one round left after the other was used by an Umbrella researcher to commit suicide, the Defense Gun is an unsuspectingly powerful weapon that packs about as much power as three shots from a Colt Python. However, because no further ammunition can be found, it is generally suited to being reserved for a boss battle more so than a regular enemy.</p><h3>Pump-Action Shotgun</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661788-shotgun.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661788" data-ratio="0.8" data-width="100" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 100px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661788-shotgun.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661788"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661788-shotgun.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661788-shotgun.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">About as reliable as ever, the remake's shotgun has a strong kick and plenty of power, making it a fine choice for just about any enemy across the game. It can kill a zombie outright with just a single shot when aimed at the head, and it can even keep Hunters at bay as well. When facing against certain boss battles, like Plant 42, the character will be shown to aim down the barrel whereas they usually aim from the hip.</p><p style="">Acquiring the shotgun can differ slightly between Chris and Jill. Because collecting the shotgun will instigate the ceiling trap, Chris therefore requires the Broken Shotgun item to trade in its place. However Jill may potentially be able to collect it without the need for the Broken Shotgun.</p><p style="">Should Jill collect the shotgun, Barry will then arrive to save her from the trap. Though only if the player didn't meet Barry prior when finding the corpse of Forest Speyer, otherwise Jill will then require the Broken Shotgun item as well.</p><h3>Assault Shotgun</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661789-assaultshotgun.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661789" data-ratio="0.8" data-width="100" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 100px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661789-assaultshotgun.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661789"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661789-assaultshotgun.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661789-assaultshotgun.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Richard Aiken's weapon of choice, the Assault Shotgun can only be attained if players manage to give him the serum to help remedy his poison infection in time. Richard doesn't give players his gun himself, however, and will instead be left as a 'parting gift' after he is killed either by Neptune (Chris's story) or Yawn (Jill's story). Once acquired, it then makes the original shotgun practically obsolete, as it can hold more ammunition and is slightly more powerful.</p><h3>Grenade Launcher</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661790-grenadelauncher.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661790" data-ratio="0.8" data-width="100" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 100px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661790-grenadelauncher.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661790"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661790-grenadelauncher.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661790-grenadelauncher.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Once again only available in Jill Valentine's story, the Grenade Launcher is a powerful and diverse weapon that has access to a small variety of grenade types. There are the regular explosive grenade rounds, which do a sizeable amount of damage against just about anything; flame rounds, which while powerful, are especially effective against such creatures as Plant 42; and acid, which has a decent degree of splash and continuous damage.</p><h3>Flamethrower</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661791-flamethrower.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661791" data-ratio="0.8" data-width="100" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 100px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661791-flamethrower.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661791"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661791-flamethrower.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661791-flamethrower.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Only find in Chris's campaign, the flamethrowers acts as both a weapon and a puzzle item, as the player requires it so as to trigger the unlocking of certain doors in the underground caverns. When used as a weapon, it's decent at staving off Hunters as the continuous spray will cause the Hunter to rapidly flinch. Fuel quickly depletes, however, and no more can be found. A second flamethrower is also conveniently left outside the area where the player faces against the giant spider queen, Black Tiger. Once the player moves on from the underground sections, they cannot take the flamethrower with them as it is required to unlock the way out.</p><h3>Rocket Launcher</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661792-rocketlauncher.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661792" data-ratio="0.8" data-width="100" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 100px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661792-rocketlauncher.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661792"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661792-rocketlauncher.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661792-rocketlauncher.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">An old four-shot rocket launcher that is only available during the final encounter against the T-002 Tyrant.

Slow and sluggish in movement, but dangerous up close, zombies are durable enough against gunfire that they can prove to be extremely dangerous even just in small numbers. When encountered on their own, however, zombies can be dispatched relatively easy so long as the player has enough ammunition to spare. As per usual, zombies are best dealt with the pistol or sometimes the shotgun, which can kill a zombie with a single shot if the player aims directly at its head once close enough, or can at least reduce the zombie to a literal crawl by destroying its legs.</p><p style="">Zombies attack by grabbing and biting the player when close, but will also puke out acid instead if they can't quite reach the player. Some zombies will be encountered lying on the ground, seemingly pretending to be dead, and will grab at a character's leg should the player get close enough. However, the leg bite does little damage and will always result in the character killing the zombie with a single stomp or kick.</p><p style="">When encountered on stairs zombies are much less of a threat, as they won't attempt to bite the player and will simply rely on their acid vomit making them significantly easier to rush past.</p><h3>Crimson Heads</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2354682-crimson.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2354682" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.8" data-width="250" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 250px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2354682-crimson.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2354682"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2354682-crimson.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2354682-crimson.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">One such infamous feature of Resident Evil are Crimson Heads. A significantly stronger, faster, and more aggressive variation of the regular zombies, the Crimson Head transformation will occur after a short while once a regular zombie has been ''killed''. The only way to halt the transformation is for players to burn the corpse afterwards (or kill a zombie by destroying the head) using a lighter and some gas fluid, both of which must be in the player's inventory for use. Otherwise after an allotted time, once returning to an area the now Crimson Head zombie will quickly spring into action and will forever persist in that area until it has been killed.</p><p style="">While Crimson Heads will place priority in hunting the player character down, they are known to also slash their way past any other regular zombies that gets in their way amidst their search.</p><h3>Cerberus Dogs</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357195-cerberus_re.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2357195" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.93896713615023" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:93.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357195-cerberus_re.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2357195"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2357195-cerberus_re.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2357195-cerberus_re.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Alongside regular zombies, some sort of iteration surrounding infected dogs have persisted across nearly every Resident Evil game to date. Starting at the beginning, so to speak, the Cerberus Dogs of Resident Evil are infected Doberman breeds, purposely engineered to be a form of B.O.W. Cerberus dogs retain the same agility and tenacity as a regular dog, though with a massive increase in aggressiveness, brutality, and stamina.</p><p style="">Like zombies, Cerberus dogs are best left for lesser weaponry like the pistols and shotguns. Running past is always an option as well, as both Chris and Jill are just ever so slightly faster than the canines. However their attacks can sometimes cover just enough distance to close the gap and catch the player character.</p><h3>Web Spinners</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357199-giant_spider.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2357199" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.60860215053763" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:60.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357199-giant_spider.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2357199"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2357199-giant_spider.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2357199-giant_spider.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Giant, hairy spiders, the Web Spinners are a tenacious foe across Resident Evil, though they primarily appear only briefly within the Residential building. They can crawl along walls like any other spider, and will often try to charge forward and bite players when given the opportunity. However, their greatest weapon is their poison spit, which they will routinely spray; it has a fairly long reach of attack and has a high chance of poisoning the player, though the base damage it inflicts isn't quite as alarming. Before they fire their spit, they can first be heard to be readying it within their body.</p><p style="">Web Spinners have surprisingly tough hides and are most susceptible to the Grenade Launcher - specifically when equipped with flame rounds. They will also often strafe once they've been shot and attempt to counter the player as such. If a Web Spinner is killed with its sack intact, a large multitude of baby spiders will seep out of the corpse and attack the player. Though their damage is even less than that of a crow and should the player leave the area, they will return to find them all gone.</p><h3>Hunters</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357193-hunter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2357193" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.4464285714286" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:144.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357193-hunter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2357193"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2357193-hunter.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2357193-hunter.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">First appearing once players return to the Mansion after investigating the Residential building, Hunters will then replace the common zombies of the game and will be encountered throughout in most areas where the zombies originally populated. Hunters are extremely dangerous and one of the most antagonising enemies throughout the franchise, let alone Resident Evil. They attack using their sharp claws and their most common source of attack is to leap through the air and slash the player. Though the player can still manage to shoot the Hunter mid-jump if they react fast enough.</p><p style="">Should the character's health be in the Caution state or lower, however, the Hunter's dive will be replaced with a swift cleave which will decapitate the character killing them instantly. Though they will at least let out a distinctive shriek first to notify players they are preparing such an attack. Hunters take one, sometimes two, shots from the Colt Python, which makes for the most suitable weapon. Otherwise the grenade launcher, and even the shotgun, can do the job if there's enough distance between the Hunter and the player. However Hunters are almost always encountered in groups of at least two.</p><h3>Chimera</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357196-chimera_remake.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2357196" data-size="small" data-ratio="1" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357196-chimera_remake.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2357196"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2357196-chimera_remake.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2357196-chimera_remake.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Encountered only within the secret underground laboratory, Chimeras are wretched creatures made up of both human and fly DNA. Like Hunters, these too were artificially created by Umbrella themselves, though they apparently proved to be unreliable and not as effective as the Hunter B.O.W. They primarily function like a cross between Web Spinners and Hunters; Chimera's can scuttle across flat surfaces, and will usually try to slash the player from above, but will also land into the floor and give chase. From this stage, Chimera's may possibly leap onto the character's back and slice them from there.</p><p style="">They can be relatively easy to avoid, however--especially if they've following whilst on the ceiling--and typically take around 2-3 shotgun rounds should direct combat come to pass. Though much like the Hunters, Chimera are rarely encountered alone and they will sometimes attempt to swarm the player as a pairing by attacking from two different directions.</p><h3>Adders</h3><p style="">Highly aggressive poisonous snakes, Adders can be found throughout the Mansion garden and will drop from the trees landing in front of the player. The damage they do is minimal, though there's a high chance they can poison the player and there's often a large number of them at that. Running past them is the best option, however due to their size they can be difficult to distinguish. If the player decides on combat they will at least die by but a single handgun shot.</p><h3>Wasps</h3><p style="">Found in the Residential building, a sizeable wasp cocoon has formed within. Though the wasps themselves do very little damage and die with at most 2 shots from a handgun, they will continually respawn until the player can find the item required to put an end to the wasp cocoon.</p><h2>Boss Battles</h2><h3>Crimson Head Prototype</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357197-crimson_head_elder.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2357197" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.0239361702128" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:102.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357197-crimson_head_elder.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2357197"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2357197-crimson_head_elder.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2357197-crimson_head_elder.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">The first zombie that underwent the Crimson Head transformation, Umbrella scientists managed to restrain it and locked it underground in a tomb. Once released by the player, it soon awakens and begins chase just as the gate is closed behind to stop the player from escaping. The Prototype functions much like an ordinary Crimson Head zombie; it'll run at the player and attempt to swipe with their claws, however it will always use its right claw, allowing the player to avoid its attack if they run to the left. It will continue this routine until it dies, which only requires around 4-5 shotgun shells on the Normal difficulty.</p><h3>Yawn Part I</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357191-pachislot_yawn.png" data-ref-id="1300-2357191" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.79110251450677" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:79.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357191-pachislot_yawn.png" data-ref-id="1300-2357191"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2357191-pachislot_yawn.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2357191-pachislot_yawn.png"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">A monstrously huge snake that resides within an attic, Yawn will surface once the player enters in search of a crest. This battle is completely voluntary, however, as the player can attempt to just collect the crest and escape. Because of the snake's size, this can sometimes prove difficult. If the player is bitten there's a high that they'll be poisoned. If the player's poisoned, the character will pass out once they escape the room.</p><p style="">As Jill, she will pass out and fall to the ground, with Barry arriving soon after who will take her to the first floor save room. This is all done instantaneously amidst a black screen, however, and Jill will wake up to find Barry gone. As Chris, he too will pass out just as he leaves the area and will be greeted by Rebecca Chambers. However in this occurrence, the player takes control of Rebecca and must collect the serum from the first floor medicinal save room for Chris within 7 minutes, otherwise he will die and the game will be over. Fighting Yawn can be tricky because of its size and its stamina; it will generally require around 10 shotgun shots or 4-5 grenade launcher rounds on the Normal difficulty to force it to flee.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400172-yawnuc.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2400172" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.77011494252874" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:77.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400172-yawnuc.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2400172"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400172-yawnuc.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400172-yawnuc.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Also to note is during Jill's playthrough, and if the player manages to save Richard Aiken from his poison infection, once the player goes to fight Yawn Richard will join soon after equipped with his custom Assault Shotgun. From there he will assist the player if they choose to attack Yawn; after so much damage, Yawn will recede away, but will strike again once Jill and Richard lower their guard and will swallow Richard whole. If the player instead chooses to ignore Yawn and collect the crest and leave, Richard will scream after no doubt suffering the same fate. If players fight alongside Richard until his inevitable death, they will then be able to collect his assault shotgun - the cutscene of Richard pushing Jill out of the way depicts him dropping his shotgun at the last second. However should players abandon Richard, then the shotgun is presumably gobbled up by Yawn alongside Richard and cannot be collected</p><h3>Yawn Part II</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400175-resident_evil_remake_giant_snake_boss_yawn.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2400175" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400175-resident_evil_remake_giant_snake_boss_yawn.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2400175"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400175-resident_evil_remake_giant_snake_boss_yawn.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400175-resident_evil_remake_giant_snake_boss_yawn.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Located in the library, Yawn will resurface after the player while they're looking for a specific book. Yawn functions exactly like it did in the previous battle and will slither throughout the environment in its attempts to bite and poison the player. Unlike the first encounter, this battle is mandatory as finally killing Yawn is the only way to trigger it knocking the bookcase and revealing a book the player needs.</p><p style="">If the player is poisoned this time they are left to carry on without any assist. Though by this point blue herbs to cure the poison are now accessible and can be found throughout the mansion. Any of the damage inflicted on Yawn previously will have had no effect and Yawn now requires a significant amount more punishment to beat.</p><h3>Lisa Trevor Part I</h3><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5322/528029-lisa_about_to_hit.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-528029" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5322/528029-lisa_about_to_hit.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-528029"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5322/528029-lisa_about_to_hit.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5322/528029-lisa_about_to_hit.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Lisa Trevor is a new character and boss specifically created for the remake. She is a young teen girl, but one that underwent extensive testing and experimentation with a number of viruses turning her into a hunchbacked monster. Lisa was actually the precursor for the Nemesis project seen in <a href="/resident-evil-3-nemesis/3030-5587" data-ref-id="3030-5587">Resident Evil 3,</a> though unlike Nemesis, Lisa cannot be controlled.</p><p style="">The first time Lisa is encountered is when the player enters the nearby cabin in the woods and is ambushed by Lisa knocking the player character out. Once the character comes to, they quickly take notice of Lisa Trevor as she slowly limps toward the player. Lisa is invincible and can only be temporarily warded for a couple of seconds; this can help the player escape the cabin, which at this point in time is the only option the player has. Lisa's attacks can do a great deal of damage at that and can kill both Chris or Jill in just 3 hits on the Normal difficulty.</p><h3>Lisa Trevor Part II</h3><p style="">Encountered within the Caves/Mines underneath the Mansion, Lisa Trevor functions as she did before and cannot be killed. Once again the player is to avoid all encounters with Lisa, though this time the player must also attempt to pull a couple of levers necessary to continue on. Like before, the player can attack Lisa enough that she may very briefly become incapacitated to allow the player past. The area is filled with a series of narrow pathways, however, which can make trying to run past Lisa head on practically impossible. Though there are multiple passageways that offer opportunities for the player to skirt Lisa and work their way around her.</p><h3>Lisa Trevor Part III</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400177-trevor_front.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2400177" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.4035087719298" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:140.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400177-trevor_front.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2400177"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400177-trevor_front.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400177-trevor_front.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">The final encounter with Lisa, Chris/Jill will arrive in a cavern and will be greeted by Albert Wesker as Chris and Barry Burton as Jill. As Chris, Wesker greets Chris and asks him to ''get a piece of the action''. During this battle, Wesker will attempt to help Chris in warding Lisa off.</p><p style="">There are two ways to beat this battle. Because the area is made of a small square platform surrounded on its left and right side by what looks like a endless pit, the player can potentially do enough damage to force Lisa off the edge, though this requires a fair amount of damage inflicted unto Lisa. Otherwise the player can attempt to manoeuvre around the area pushing the stones off of the surface; once all four have been pushed off, this will open the coffin in the middle that contains the remains of Lisa's mother. The sight of her mother will drive Lisa to temporarily express the one small piece of humanity she has left as she cries in vain at her mother and leaps off into the abyss with a shriek.</p><p style="">With Jill this battle plays out the same, though the opening will offer the player a choice to hand Barry his custom magnum after handily taking it off him after he threateningly directed it at Jill. If the player chooses Yes, then Barry will fight alongside Jill; if No, then Lisa will knock Barry off killing him, forcing Jill to fight alone but also letting her keep Barry's fully loaded magnum revolver.</p><p style="">When fighting against Lisa she uses the same array of attacks. Though the tactic for knocking her off works both ways as she too can not only knock the player off, but also their AI ally. If Barry is knocked off he is then declared dead for the ending. However, if Wesker is knocked off he will still appear during the end as per usual. Wesker surviving the drop is never brought up nor explained later in the game.</p><h3>Neptune</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400182-re_neptune.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2400182" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.68834080717489" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:68.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400182-re_neptune.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2400182"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400182-re_neptune.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400182-re_neptune.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">An even more aggressive breed of shark, Neptune is a great white infected with the T-Virus and is the most unconventional boss battle in the game as the player doesn't actually fight it. Once entering the aqua tank, the player will be enveloped in knee high water which will slow their character's movement speed. The player is to quickly run across the walkway into the control room before Neptune leaps out and attacks; the music will quickly rise in tempo and urgency to let the player know how close Neptune is to attacking. It's possible to avoid Neptune, but if it is in reach of the player it will quickly pull the player into the water killing them instantly.</p><p style="">Once the player has reached the control room, and has climbed down the ladder, they'll now be underwater, faced by Neptune on the opposite side of the window. Neptune will then attempt to break the glass, forcing the player to configure the settings in the control room to close the shutters over the window before Neptune smashes through the glass. Once that's done, and the water has been drained, the player will leave the room leading into the ground floor of the tank. Along the way the player will encounter two lesser infected sharks which are barely clinging to life within the oxygen. The player may choose to mercy kill them, though it's not necessary.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400184-full.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2400184" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400184-full.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2400184"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400184-full.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400184-full.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Eventually the player will reach Neptune, who is surfaced within a small pool of shallow water. It is completely docile for the time being, but once the player tries to grab a key they require on a platform past Neptune, it will spring into action and attempt to attack the player. Neptune cannot move, but the player is trapped on the small raised platform. Pushing the circuit box into the water and turning on the power will then kill Neptune completely, allowing the player to move past safely.</p><p style="">As Jill the scenario plays out as such, though when playing as Chris, and if Richard was cured of the snake poison inflicted by Yawn, Chris will encounter Richard as he first enters the tank. Richard will then quickly push Chris out of the way -- saving him from Neptune's attack, but dying in his place. Once the player has drained the tank, they can collect Richard's custom shotgun on the tank's ground floor.</p><h3>Plant 42</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400178-pachislot_plant_42.png" data-ref-id="1300-2400178" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.97229916897507" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:97.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400178-pachislot_plant_42.png" data-ref-id="1300-2400178"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400178-pachislot_plant_42.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400178-pachislot_plant_42.png"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">A huge and incredibly hostile plant that has been infused with the T-Virus. Dubbed Plant 42 for being located within ''Point 42'', the carnivorous plant has entrenched itself within the Residential Building and uses its vines to attack its prey throughout the building via small holes in the floors, walls and ceiling. If the player nears any of these holes, the plant's vine will attack and attempt to strangle the player until they waggle it off by mashing on the buttons. Once the body of the Plant has been located, this initiates the boss battle. Large in size, reaching the ceiling at around 12ft in height, it primarily attacks by using its vines to squirt small droplets of acid, though it will also attempt to attack the player by swiping them with its vines as well.</p><p style="">The best strategy is for the player to climb up the stairs reaching what remains of the second floor and shoot at the bulb. After enough damage, it will recede only to quickly sprout back out. As Jill, once this occurs Barry will arrive conveniently equipped with a flamethrower and will lay waste to the creature killing it.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400179-plant421_gamecube_res.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2400179" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400179-plant421_gamecube_res.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2400179"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400179-plant421_gamecube_res.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400179-plant421_gamecube_res.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">As Chris, the player may need to continue fighting from this stage until it's killed. However, if the player managed to save Richard, then as soon as Chris enters the room he will quickly be grabbed by the creature, just as Rebecca arrives on the scene. Chris will then hand her a file to help in creating the ''V-Jolt," a type of poison that will kill the plant. Now controlling Rebecca, the player is to head to the nearby chemistry room and make the concoction. With the V-Jolt made, the player must then find the roots within the building and administer the V-Jolt, which will weaken Plant 42 as before, releasing Chris. Though this won't have killed it completely and requires the player to unload a few more shotgun shells to put an end to Plant 42.</p><h3>Black Tiger</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400174-black2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2400174" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.69949494949495" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:69.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400174-black2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2400174"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400174-black2.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400174-black2.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">A gigantic tarantula, even by the giant spider standards of the game, the appropriately coined Black Tiger is colored in shades of black and grey. It functions like its smaller kin of spiders, though its poison spit is more ferocious and will actually shoot three splashes at once with a greater range. The environment is relatively small, which allows the player to run around the creature to keep out of its poison distance. The shotgun, grenade launcher and magnum work as expected, though Black Tiger is especially weak to flame rounds shot from the grenade launcher. As Chris, the player will have a flamethrower available which is also effective. Alongside Black Tiger are two regular Web Spinners as well that have the same attributes as previously encountered Web Spinners</p><p style="">Once killed, a multitude of small spiders will begin to seep out of its corpse, though leaving the area and returning will remove them from the area.</p><h3>Tyrant T-002 Part I</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357192-re_tyrant.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2357192" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.5748299319728" data-width="294" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 294px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:157.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357192-re_tyrant.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2357192"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2357192-re_tyrant.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2357192-re_tyrant.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">After Wesker's betrayal is revealed, he (or Barry accidentally) will release Tyrant, where it will proceed to slowly walk towards the player. The battle itself is relatively simple as it will only walk towards the player, though it won't flinch against any gunfire. Keeping Tyrant at a safe distance, while circling the large lab equipment, the player should be able to down the monster without taking any damage so long as they have enough ammo. Tyrant is unsurprisingly thick skinned and requires a fair amount of ammunition; the magnum alone will still take around 8 rounds to put down on the Normal difficulty.</p><h3>Tyrant T-002 Part II</h3><p style="">The final battle of the game, this second encounter with Tyrant is only triggered should the player have Barry or Rebecca alive, otherwise this battle will be skipped altogether and Brad Vickers will arrive to pick up the remaining characters.</p><p style="">Otherwise it will erupt from the ground on the heliport and its gameplay design will have now changed drastically. No longer content in steadily walking towards the player, Tyrant will now routinely break into a quick sprint and swipe with its massive claw at the player dealing a great deal of damage. With Barry or Rebecca at their side, the player at least has some backup. Though they too can be killed by Tyrant and must also reload when necessary. After Tyrant has received enough damage, or the timer that is ticking down has reached around 30 seconds, Brad Vickers will drop down a rocket launcher the player must use to kill Tyrant.</p><p style="">Equipped with only four shots, the Tyrant will manage to deflect the first, though the second will score a direct hit destroying the Tyrant completely.</p><h2>Unlockables</h2><p style="">Resident Evil contains just about all of the original version's suite of unlockables and some of its own original inclusions.</p><h3>Costumes</h3><p style="">Getting the Happy ending (with all three characters surviving the Mansion Incident) will gift a key that the player begins with in their inventory once they load their completed save.

Because of its higher fire rate, the Samurai Edge can prove useful not only against regular zombies, but even larger enemies like Hunters and certain bosses given its infinite quantity of ammunition. The Samurai Edge is unlocked by completing the game once under five hours on the Normal or Hard difficulty setting, and can be found in the character's inventory when loading a cleared game save.</p><h3><b>Rocket Launcher</b></h3><p style="">Unlocked by completing the game on Normal or Hard under 3 hours. Found in the player's inventory upon loading their completed save file, the rocket launcher can kill everything (besides the Tyrant on the helipad) in one shot.</p><h3>One Dangerous Zombie Mode</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2664551-468px-jill_and_forest.png" data-ref-id="1300-2664551" data-ratio="0.70512820512821" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:70.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2664551-468px-jill_and_forest.png" data-ref-id="1300-2664551"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2664551-468px-jill_and_forest.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2664551-468px-jill_and_forest.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Unlocked by completing the game on any difficulty in any time, this mode is then weaved into any following playthroughs. The game will play out as usual, however the zombified Forest Speyer will sporadically appear in certain areas and will give chase. Forest will function like an ordinary zombie and will try to grab and bite the player, though he runs at the speed of a Crimson Head. The player cannot attack Forest in any way, either, as he has a bandoleer of grenades strapped around his torso and any attacks will cause him to explode -- killing the player instantly regardless of the distance.</p><p style="">Because Forest is travelling around the mansion and has already reanimated, he will of course not be found in the outside balcony as per usual. Forest will also only be encountered within the Spencer Mansion and will not follow into the other environments across the game. There is no way to turn off this mode and the player must start a new save to play without the stalking of Speyer.</p><h3>Invisible Enemy Mode</h3><p style="">Unlocked by completing on any difficulty in any time, the Invisible Enemy Mode is as self-explanatory as they get -- all of the enemies within the game, bosses included, are invisible to the player. There is no longer any auto aim at that, though they will make their typical sound effects once the player is in the location. The player's unlockable weapons/costumes will not carry over into this mode.</p><h3>Real Survivor Mode</h3><p style="">Unlocked by completing on any difficulty in any time, Real Survivor mode was initially a prototype mode for the original Resident Evil. Its notary difference is that the item boxes no longer share items and any items stored in one particular box will forever stay exclusively in that one box. Auto aim is also disabled and the gameplay modifiers are set within the Hard mode settings.</p><h2>HD Remastered Port</h2><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2692550-residentevilremakevideo610.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2692550" data-ratio="0.56229508196721" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2692550-residentevilremakevideo610.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2692550"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2692550-residentevilremakevideo610.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2692550-residentevilremakevideo610.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Announced on August 5th, 2014 was an HD port version of the Resident Evil remake for PS3, PS4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and PC. Its pre-rendered backgrounds are to be upscaled (720p on PS3 and Xbox 360; 1080p on PS4 and Xbox One), though certain objects and even whole areas were redone completely in polygons.</p><p style="">Character models are redone in HD, and it also allows players to select between 4:3 or 16:9 aspect ratio. However when playing in 16:9 the screen will crop the image and then pan up/down depending on the direction the character moves.</p><p style="">While the game still offers the classic tank control scheme, more modernized analogue controls are also be available as an alternative -- to which the player can switch between in real-time. A Very Easy mode was included as well to further increase its accessibility for a more modern audience. The Remastered port was released in both physical and digital formats, however its physical format is restricted to its PS3 and 360 versions, and only in Japan.</p><p style="">Online Leaderboards are available in this version, as is a new Gallery mode that lets players re-watch the game's pre-rendered cutscenes.</p><p style="">The port was rather successful and proved to be Capcom's top selling digital release of all time, selling over a million copies. This success resulted in the team moving on to have <a href="/resident-evil-zero/3030-10247" data-ref-id="3030-10247">Resident Evil Zero</a> undergo a similar such remastering.</p><h3>Contagion Campaign</h3><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2687501-2684701-10711079_845057115515177_4484635678431131443_n%2B%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2687501" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2687501-2684701-10711079_845057115515177_4484635678431131443_n%2B%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2687501"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2687501-2684701-10711079_845057115515177_4484635678431131443_n%2B%281%29.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2687501-2684701-10711079_845057115515177_4484635678431131443_n%2B%281%29.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">A form of viral marketing for the HD Remaster port, the Contagion Campaign allowed Resident Evil fans to ''spread the infection'' by signing up via email, facebook, or <a href="/resident-evilnet/3015-7553" data-ref-id="3015-7553">ResidentEvil.net</a>. Upon doing so would add to the overall infection percentage shown on the site; sharing the user's status on such social media sites as facebook or twitter would also help further the infection.</p><p style="">Capcom later announced that should the infection reach 100%, they would include Chris and Jill's BSAA outfits from <a href="/resident-evil-5/3030-20569" data-ref-id="3030-20569">Resident Evil 5</a> in the game, though Chris's his Lost in Nightmares outfit as opposed to his default RE5 attire.</p><p style="">On September 26th, the ''infection'' officially reached 100%, assuring that the new costumes were to appear in the HD Remastered port. The costumes are unlocked at the outset and can be selected within the character select menu, which is also now how the other unlockable costumes of the game are to be selected as well.</p><h2>Development</h2><p style="">To better connect this game with narrative advancements of later games, Resident Evil spliced in some additional story details that were absent from the original. One of the more noticeable ones is the addition of <a href="/george-trevor/3005-11814" data-ref-id="3005-11814">George</a> and <a href="/lisa-trevor/3005-6121" data-ref-id="3005-6121">Lisa Trevor</a>. George designed the Arklay Mansion which ultimately ended up being his grave and his daughter Lisa was the subject of Umbrella's hideous experiments and will be encountered by the player at various times through the game. These additions were scrapped from the original game but have been added in to give the Resident Evil mythos some more depth. Other such additions include the mention of <a href="/william-birkin/3005-3332" data-ref-id="3005-3332">William Birkin</a> and <a href="/alexia-ashford/3005-4456" data-ref-id="3005-4456">Alexia Ashford</a>.</p><p style="">There were also several new locations created for the remake such as the Graveyard behind the secret door in the main hall and Lisa's Cabin in the Courtyard. These extra locations gave the game new puzzles that the player would find a new challenge even if they played and completed the original. Even puzzles that were ported over from the original were remixed, as were enemy placements and the general design of the mansion was reworked in places so as to give the mansion the feeling of nostalgia, yet with plenty of surprises for veterans of the series.</p><h2>PC System Requirements</h2><h3>MINIMUM</h3><ul><li>OS: Windows 7 SP1 / Windows 8.1</li><li>Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo 2.4

available on the PlayStation Network.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style=""> <i>Dead Nation</i> is a <a data-ref-id="3015-788" href="/top-down-perspective/3015-788"> top-down</a>, dual-analog shooter exclusively for the <a data-ref-id="3045-88" href="/playstation-network-ps3/3045-88"> PSN</a> developed by <a data-ref-id="3010-2107" href="/housemarque/3010-2107"> Housemarque</a>, the developers of the similar smash-hit PSN title <a data-ref-id="3030-793" href="/super-stardust-hd/3030-793"> Super Stardust HD</a>. The game takes place in a world overrun by a zombie apocalypse. Playing as either <a data-ref-id="3005-17285" href="/jack-mcready/3005-17285"> Jack McReady</a> or <a data-ref-id="3005-17286" href="/scarlett-blake/3005-17286"> Scarlett Blake</a>, who are both immune to the virus, the goal is to escape the city alive and help find a cure to the virus sweeping the globe. In order to escape in one piece, Jack and Scarlett will have to fight through hoards of the <a data-ref-id="3015-79" href="/zombie/3015-79"> zombies</a> in a city teeming with the undead, some of which have evolved and mutated into more dangerous creatures. The story is told between levels using still frames and narration in a style similar to a graphic novel.</p><p style="">The game features ten levels, all of which can be played in either local or online two-player cooperative mode.</p><h2>Characters</h2><p style="">As the game supports both local offline two player co-op and online two player co-op via PSN, the player has two choices of characters that share identical stats. While the story is the same for both characters, your choice determines the narrator during the cutscenes. When playing cooperatively, Jack and Skarlett alternate as narrator, and the narrative replaces all instances of "I" with "we" and other similar edits.</p><table class="t-editor with-out-border natural-width"><tbody><tr><th>Jack McReady</th><th>Skarlett Blake</th></tr><tr><td><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81887/1647680-jack_mcready_dead_nation.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1647680" data-size="small" style="width: 240px" data-ratio="1" data-width="240" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81887/1647680-jack_mcready_dead_nation.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1647680"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/81887/1647680-jack_mcready_dead_nation.jpg"></a></figure></td><td><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81887/1647682-dead_nation_scarlett_blake.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1647682" data-size="small" style="width: 240px" data-ratio="1" data-width="240" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81887/1647682-dead_nation_scarlett_blake.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1647682"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/81887/1647682-dead_nation_scarlett_blake.jpg"></a></figure></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">Dead Nation plays very similarly to <a data-ref-id="3030-793" href="/super-stardust-hd/3030-793"> Super Stardust HD</a>. While the left analog stick moves your character, the right analog stick is used to aim. The R1 and L1 buttons are reserved for shooting and throwing items, while the R2 and L2 buttons are used for melee attacks and a rush/dodge move. The game encourages you to keep up a score multiplier by killing zombies, finding special items and not getting injured. This multiplier increases the amount of money you get from each kill, as well as the amount of money you can find in containers and car trunks around each level. This money can be used to buy upgrades for your guns and throwable items, such as power, fire rate and magazine size for guns and damage radius for throwable items like grenades. While your armor affects your melee damage, damage resistance and speed, your armor cannot be upgraded with money. Instead, pieces of armor with different stats can be found in each level that you can mix-and-match according to your style of play.</p><h2>Inventory</h2><p style="">Some of the games weapons include:</p><ul class="plain-list"><li><b>SMG</b></li></ul><ul class="plain-list"><li><b>Assault Rifle</b></li><li><b>Shotgun</b></li><li><b>Flamethrower</b></li><li><b>Blade Cannon</b></li><li><b>Launcher</b></li><li><b>Shocker</b></li></ul><ul class="plain-list"><li><b>Grenades</b></li><li><b>Mines</b></li><li><b>Flares</b></li><li><b>Molotov</b></li></ul><ul class="plain-list"><li><b>Remotely Detonated Explosives</b></li></ul><p style="">Savvy players can employ various strategies to aid their onslaught of the undead hordes. Flares and car alarms can be used to attract zombies and distract them. Sustained damage on these vehicles will cause them to explode and incinerate any enemies in the nearby blast radius, which can prove to be helpful when dealing with large crowds.</p><h2>Online Meta-game</h2><p style="">Dead Nation also features a dynamically-updated global leaderboard (in addition to traditional local leaderboards) which pits countries against each other in a "who can kill more zombies" competition. Every kill a player makes will add to their countries total. When a certain number of kills has been reached, a new "infection cycle" will begin. Players will be notified of any changes to the leaderboards via the news-style ticker tape which runs at the bottom of the screen's front end menus.</p><h2>Trivia</h2><ul class="plain-list"><li>The first trailer was released at <a data-ref-id="3015-3674" href="/gamescom-2009/3015-3674"> GamesCom 2009</a> and more wasn't revealed until <a data-ref-id="3015-4529" href="/e3-2010/3015-4529"> E3 2010</a>.</li></ul><ul class="plain-list"><li>Housemarque recently employed a "Super Stardust Pro" by the name of Tlo-Mek, followed by a press release citing this fact and featuring Dead Nation gameplay footage showcasing Tlo-Mek's gaming prowess.</li><li> <i>Dead Nation </i>was one of the free PS3 games offered by Sony for digital download in the Welcome Back offer, an apology after the Playstation Network was hacked and subsequently disabled in the spring of 2011.</li></ul>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>27866</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/6/63119/1556166-dead_nation.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/63119/1556166-dead_nation.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/6/63119/1556166-dead_nation.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/63119/1556166-dead_nation.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/6/63119/1556166-dead_nation.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/63119/1556166-dead_nation.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/6/63119/1556166-dead_nation.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Dead Nation]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>5</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-16/]]></api_detail_url><id>16</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: M]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-37/]]></api_detail_url><id>37</id><name><![CDATA[PEGI: 18+]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2010-11-30 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-88/]]></api_detail_url><id>88</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation Network (PS3)]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-network-ps3/3045-88/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3N]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-143/]]></api_detail_url><id>143</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation Network (Vita)]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-network-vita/3045-143/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PSNV]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/]]></api_detail_url><id>146</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 4]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS4]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/dead-nation/3030-27866/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-28141/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2009-09-15 13:10:18</date_added><date_last_updated>2015-06-21 10:37:34</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[Shantae was released on DSiWare on October 4, 2010, courtesy of WayForward. This game is WayForward's first release since Mighty Flip Champs, which was also released for the DSi.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview &amp; History</h2><p style="">Shantae: Risky's Revenge is the first of three <a href="/shantae/3025-1493" data-ref-id="3025-1493">Shantae</a> games on the way to the DSi. It is a sequel of the <a href="/game-boy-color/3045-57" data-ref-id="3045-57">Game Boy Color</a> game named after the main character of the games, <a href="/shantae/3005-10421" data-ref-id="3005-10421">Shantae</a> the half-genie. This game is <a href="/wayforward-technologies/3010-2294" data-ref-id="3010-2294">WayForward</a>'s first release since <a href="/mighty-flip-champs/3030-25552" data-ref-id="3030-25552">Mighty Flip Champs</a>, which was also released for the DSi. Information from Nintendo Power reveals a new mermaid friend, and a pirate ship (presumably belonging to <a href="/risky-boots/3005-10422" data-ref-id="3005-10422">Risky Boots</a>) with legs.</p><p style="">The game is a culmination of work done since 2002, at which point work began on a Shantae Sequel for the <a href="/game-boy-advance/3045-4" data-ref-id="3045-4">Game Boy Advance</a>. The game was used as a demo on many different platforms in the intervening 8 years, including <a href="/psp/3045-18" data-ref-id="3045-18">PSP</a>, <a href="/wii/3045-36" data-ref-id="3045-36">Wii</a>, <a href="/nintendo-ds/3045-52" data-ref-id="3045-52">DS</a> and GBA, until it was decided to be turned into a <a href="/dsiware/3045-106" data-ref-id="3045-106">DSiWare</a> release instead of a full-fledged video game. This game features many artifacts from that original sequel.</p><p style="">On September 9th, 2011 <a href="http://toucharcade.com/2011/09/09/wayforward-bringing-shantae-to-ios-with-shantae-riskys-revenge/" rel="nofollow">it was revealed</a> that the game was being ported to the iPhone and other iOS devices. To accommodate for the virtual D-Pad, the game has been tweaked to make it feel on par with the original DSi Ware release. This includes making platforms slightly longer, having chains sway closer to the player, and changes to enemy behavior.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">Shantae: Risky's Revenge is a side-scrolling action-platformer taking many structural cues from <a href="/metroid/3025-3" data-ref-id="3025-3">Metroid</a>. The entire gameplay world is a relatively continuous space, with certain areas inaccessible to Shantae until she acquires the appropriate shape-shifting with which she can reach them. These abilities (described below in Forms) allow her to vault across wide horizontal expanses; ram through stone barriers; and swim underwater. There is one town in the game which acts as a <a href="/hub-world/3015-1855" data-ref-id="3015-1855">central hub</a> for the game, though it doesn't technically lie exactly in the "center" of the game world and it isn't disconnected from the other areas of the game.</p><p style="">At various points in the game, Shantae will be tasked with simple fetch quests that involve her finding an item in one area of the game world and bringing it to the appropriate recipient (not always the requester) in another. These serve to advance the story as well as unlock fortresses that house boss characters she must defeat.</p><h3>Combat and Handling</h3><p style="">Shantae is nimble and can walk, run, jump, crouch, crawl under low spaces, and <a href="/dash/3015-2290" data-ref-id="3015-2290">backwards-dash</a>. She can change her direction mid-jump. She can also swim, but initially she can't dive into the depths of the sea as she simply floats back up to the surface whenever she tries. Her primary attack involves her <a href="/hair-attack/3015-710" data-ref-id="3015-710">whipping foes with her long ponytail</a>. Shantae can only attack with this method to the left or right of her. In general, her primary attack does not knock back enemies that can sustain multiple hits, so Shantae is able to repeatedly hit them with rapid successive ponytail strikes. In addition to damaging enemies, Shantae can also destroy certain bricks and vases with her ponytail.</p><p style="">Shantae can also employ magic to attack with projectile and orbiting barriers. Each use of a projectile reduces her magic meter by a set amount. For orbiting barriers, the magic meter is continually drained based on how long the barrier is kept activated. Shantae also fires off a bubble as her primary attack when in mermaid form (see Forms below).</p><h3>Items and Currency</h3><p style="">Shantae purchases the aforementioned magic from the item shop in town, where she can also purchase curative items for her health and magic meter, as well as upgrades for her hair (to allow for faster whipping) and a map of the game world. Items are purchased with gems, dropped by defeated enemies and found in treasure chests and vases. Some require magic jams, which are a finite <a href="/pick-ups/3015-2619" data-ref-id="3015-2619">pickup</a> scattered across the game world.</p><h4>Items and Spells</h4><ul><li>Potions - These recover several hearts of Shantae's health. They are sold in the item shop for 10 gems, or 25 gems for a pack of three potions. Though these can be used whenever Shantae wishes, Shantae can also find potions that take instant effect by breaking vases or defeating enemies.</li><li>Magic Vial - These recover a set amount of Shantae's magic bar. They are sold in the item shops for 15 gems, or 40 gems for a pack of three vials. Though these can be used whenever Shantae wishes, Shantae can also find vials that take instant effect by breaking vases or defeating enemies.</li><li>Fire-based magic - Fire magic can be purchased in three levels from the shop: a fireball for 30 gems; Spitfire (a triple fireball) for 50 gems and a bottle of magic jam; and a Flamethrower (continuous stream) for 300 gems and 2 bottles of magic jam.</li><li>Puffs - Despite the name, the Storm puff (50 gems), the Crush puff (125 gems, 1 jam) and the Mega Puff (250 gems, 2 jams) are powerful magical attacks emitted by storm clouds that Shantae deploys. Once deployed in an area, the storm clouds hover around that space and throw out the attacks of their own volition.</li><li>Pike ball shields - The pike ball shields act as an orbiting barrier around Shantae, similar to the special attacks found in the <a href="/mega-man/3025-523" data-ref-id="3025-523">Mega Man</a> franchise (from <a href="/wood-man/3005-1185" data-ref-id="3005-1185">Wood Man</a> and <a href="/skull-man/3005-1383" data-ref-id="3005-1383">Skull Man</a>, to name two examples) or <a href="/ryu-hayabusa/3005-104" data-ref-id="3005-104">Ryu</a>'s Invincible Fire Wheel from <a href="/ninja-gaiden-ii-the-dark-sword-of-chaos/3030-14416" data-ref-id="3030-14416">Ninja Gaiden</a>. Each increasing level adds one pike ball to the mix, for a total of three pike balls. (Pike ball: 50 gems; Super pike ball: 150 gems and 1 jam; Mega Pike ball: 300 gems and 2 jams)</li><li>Attract Magic - This draws dropped items from enemies to Shantae when she comes near them, without requiring her to come in direct contact with them in order to pick them up. It is an always-on upgrade and does not drain her magic meter. (100 gems, 1 jam)</li><li>Magic Fill - This spell gradually fills Shantae magic meter over time. This is always active once purchased. (150 gems, 1 jam)</li><li>Hair creams - The Silky Cream (200 gems, 3 jams) and Super Silky Cream (300 gems, 3 jams) increases the speed at which Shantae attacks with her ponytail, allowing her to land more hits on her enemies in a shorter amount of time.</li><li>Sequin Land Map - Displays a map of the entire gameworld, including a very rough layout of underground caverns.</li></ul><h3>Forms</h3><p style="">As a genie, Shantae is--naturally--a belly dancer. Throughout the game, she gains the ability to shapeshift into different animal forms depending on what belly dance she executes. Mechanically, on <a href="/nintendo-ds/3045-52" data-ref-id="3045-52">DS</a> platforms this is achieved by holding down the X button and then releasing it after a certain amount of time. How long the player holds down the button before releasing it determines which dance move she stops on, which in turn determines which form she takes on.</p><ul><li>Monkey - The first form she finds, Shantae shifts into a tiny monkey when she ends the dance during her first move. As a monkey, Shantae can climb on walls as well as jump farther and higher than she can normally. Further into the game, Shantae acquires an upgrade to the monkey form that allows her to rocket across wide horizontal expanses. This allows her to reach areas that were previously blocked by large chasms. She cannot attack in this form.</li><li>Elephant - The second form she finds, Shantae shifts into a large elephant who can charge into and destroy large stone blocks. She can also demolish the stone golems that block her path from some of the later areas in the game.</li><li>Mermaid - The final form she finds, Shantae shifts into a mermaid capable of diving deep into the water, allowing her to access underwater areas. Further into the game, Shantae acquires an upgrade to the mermaid form that allows her to fire off a bubble that damages enemies and destroys certain underwater barriers. Without this upgrade, Shantae cannot attack in this form at all.</li></ul>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>28141</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/9/97089/2171063-shantae.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/97089/2171063-shantae.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/9/97089/2171063-shantae.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/9/97089/2171063-shantae.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/9/97089/2171063-shantae.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/97089/2171063-shantae.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/9/97089/2171063-shantae.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Shantae: Risky's Revenge]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>1</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-29/]]></api_detail_url><id>29</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: E10+]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-36/]]></api_detail_url><id>36</id><name><![CDATA[PEGI: 12+]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2010-10-04 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-96/]]></api_detail_url><id>96</id><name><![CDATA[iPhone]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/iphone/3045-96/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[IPHN]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-106/]]></api_detail_url><id>106</id><name><![CDATA[DSiWare]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/dsiware/3045-106/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[DSI]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-121/]]></api_detail_url><id>121</id><name><![CDATA[iPad]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/ipad/3045-121/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[IPAD]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-138/]]></api_detail_url><id>138</id><name><![CDATA[Nintendo 3DS eShop]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-3ds-eshop/3045-138/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[3DSE]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-139/]]></api_detail_url><id>139</id><name><![CDATA[Wii U]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/wii-u/3045-139/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[WIIU]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/]]></api_detail_url><id>146</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 4]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS4]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/shantae-riskys-revenge/3030-28141/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-29010/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2009-10-11 14:09:27</date_added><date_last_updated>2015-01-25 00:33:32</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[Black Wing Foundation is developing third-person shooter Scivelation for the next generation of gaming consoles.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Scivelation is an upcoming third-person shooter from Ukrainian developer <a href="/black-wing-foundation/3010-7892" data-ref-id="3010-7892">Black Wing Foundation</a>.

Led by an unusual group of outcasts, industry titans, <a href="/pirates/3015-445" data-ref-id="3015-445">pirates</a> and former military leaders, the New Conglomerate has found itself with significant power of its own, and is prepared to achieve their goals by any means necessary.</p><h4>Vanu Sovereignty</h4><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122710/2436513-2147533414-Logo_.png" data-ref-id="1300-2436513" style="width: 150px" data-ratio="1" data-width="150" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122710/2436513-2147533414-Logo_.png" data-ref-id="1300-2436513"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/122710/2436513-2147533414-Logo_.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/122710/2436513-2147533414-Logo_.png"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Vanu has taught that only through advanced technology can humanity evolve to its next state of existence. The Vanu Sovereignty is extremely advanced, frequently using powerful alien technology on the battlefield. Their sole purpose is to uncover the secrets hidden away in ancient artifacts scattered over the surface of Auraxis, and they will destroy any group that interferes or threatens the world they seek to study.</p><h3>Classes</h3><h4>Infiltrator</h4><p style="">A unit with nearly no armor to protect it, relying instead on cloaking technology and sniper rifles to assist it in reconnaissance and sabotage actions.</p><h4>Light Assault</h4><p style="">A lightly-armored unit with jump jets and a lightweight rifle for quick movement and vertical agility on the battlefield. This unit also carries deployable ammo packs, in order to provide the ammunition required for whole squads to sustain longer engagements with the enemy.</p><h4>Medic</h4><p style="">A unit with a tool to heal others around them, and able to take the fight to the enemy with light rifles and armor, akin to the Light Assault class. Medics keep others alive and revive fallen players, aiding in keeping the men and women around them in good condition, no matter the odds stacked against them.</p><h4>Engineer</h4><p style="">A unit with light armor and basic weapons for infantry assault, these units specialize in field repairs of vehicle and MAX armor, as well as being able to deploy various offensive and defensive force augmenters such as mines and stationary manned turret emplacements.</p><h4>Heavy Assault</h4><p style="">A unit with most man-sized weapons available to them, these soldiers not only have the heaviest armor of normal infantry, but also can use the hardest-hitting weaponry, including infantry-based anti-tank weaponry. To increase the survivability in a sustained fight, the Heavy Assault can activate a shield that will absorb damage for a short time.</p><h4>MAX</h4><p style="">A large exo-suit unit with massive armor and two arm-mounted heavy weapons, the MAX units act as the anchor for any infantry assault, against enemy infantry, armor, or air. These units are built like man-sized walking tanks and are the dealers of death, though their lack of agility can leave them extremely exposed if not supported by friendly forces.</p><h3>Continents</h3><h4>Amerish</h4><p style="">Jungle and wetlands rule this place, with colored crystallites scattered around and broken open to the uncaring world of the ongoing war around them. Heavily forested zones make for a lot of cover from air vehicles and difficult for larger, more cumbersome land vehicles to navigate easily.</p><h4>Esamir</h4><p style="">A land forever entombed in a harsh winter, this cold land is home to mountainous and rocky terrain covered in a white glaze of fresh snowfall. A desolate place from the biting cold, there is little in the way of flora to hide among or behind, and as such will likely be dominated by aircraft.</p><h4>Indar</h4><p style="">A desert continent, this map is home to a lush plateau in the north leading down into severe and crevassed terrain, as well as large desert plains. The main open spaces makes this map a prime place for vehicular assaults and transport.</p><h3>Vehicles and Weapons</h3><p style="">Weapon and vehicle pools are broken up into the “common pool” and “empire-specific” groupings. Common pool weapons and vehicles are available to all who have the skills for them, meaning that they tend to be highly specialized or fairly average because of the fact that every empire can access them. Empire-specific weapons and vehicles, however, are unique to their empire and not available to those of the opposing factions. These tend to take on the characteristics of each empire and add flavor to them unique from each other.</p><p style="">For example, the common pool light tank, the Lightning, is something that anyone who has unlocked the skill for light armor can use. It is very nimble and has fire-power approaching the larger tanks, but its light armor prevents it from withstanding too much damage in a fight with anti-tank weaponry or larger main battle tanks. If one were to skill into heavier armor, a player of the New Conglomerate could access the Vanguard, the most heavily armored and most powerful of the MBTs, but also quite slow; a player of the Terran Republic would have the Prowler available to them, equipped with a multi-barrelled turret and overall the quickest of the MBTs, sporting medium armor; a Vanu Sovereignty player would use the Magrider, the most overall manoeuvrable MBT, using anti-gravitic generators to float over land and water, allowing strafing like no other tank could accomplish with treads, as well as a straight-line (meaning no real projectile drop over distance) plasma cannon that is attached directly to the chassis of the tank itself.</p><h2>Business Model</h2><p style="">PlanetSide 2 has been developed and launched as a free-to-play (F2P) game, unlike the original which was built as a subscription-based MMO. While the Station Cash store is available in-game, the designers have no intention to provide “pay-to-win” advantages for real money. In addition to “sidegraded” weapons and ammunition for certain consumable items, the store contains customization options for guns, soldiers, and vehicles that can be acquired only with Station Cash, Sony Online Entertainment’s virtual goods currency.</p><h2>Beta</h2><p style="">Starting in late June/early July 2012, an invitational beta began with priority access given to original PlanetSide veterans and those with a key from the April 2012 edition of PC Gamer.</p><h2>Playstation 4 Version</h2><p style="">On June 5, 2013, Sony announced the Planetside 2 would be coming to the PS4.

However, under the belief that their predominantly male target audience would not play such a game starring a woman, management demanded that the protagonist be replaced with a man, and further tied the previously-unrelated game into the then-abandoned <a href="/true-crime/3025-257" data-ref-id="3025-257">True Crime</a> franchise. However, due to factors such as the abysmal critical reception and sales of the last True Crime game, <a href="/true-crime-new-york-city/3030-3345" data-ref-id="3030-3345">True Crime: New York City</a>, and concerns over how the game would perform in the current market, the game underwent a turbulent development cycle. Initially, the game was developed at <a href="/luxoflux-corp/3010-1929" data-ref-id="3010-1929">Luxoflux</a>, but Activision halted development, only to restart the project at United Front Games. The game was initially entitled simply "True Crime", and then changed to "True Crime: Hong Kong".</p><p style="">Activision cancelled the title a second time in February of 2011, and the game was subsequently picked up by Square-Enix, who made the announcement on August 1st, 2011. However, because Square-Enix did not purchase the True Crime intellectual property, the game was forced to undergo one final name change. On February 8th, 2012, Square-Enix officially announced that development had been resumed, and that the game had been renamed "Sleeping Dogs". The game was released on August 14, 2012 in the US and August 17th, 2012 in Europe and Australia.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p style="">The game tells the story of <a href="/wei-shen/3005-14298" data-ref-id="3005-14298">Wei Shen</a>, an Chinese-American cop who is transferred to Hong Kong to infiltrate the Triads. According to the developers, he's based off Leonardo DiCaprio's character in the movie <i>The Departed</i>, which was in turn a remake of a Hong Kong movie entitled <i>Infernal Affairs</i>. They wanted to make a hero who got hit a lot and didn't seem invincible.</p><p style="">During an undercover operation Wei is arrested and taken to a holding cell where he meets an old friend, Jackie Ma, who offers Wei a job and a possible in with the Sun On Yee family. After a meeting with the Hong Kong Police Inspector, Wei agrees to take the offer in order to infiltrate the Triads, sinking deep into the machinations of one of the world's most notorious criminal organizations. Initially, Wei has to prove himself to the Sun On Yee that he is not a cop, but earns their trust. However, being arrested again, Wei is introduced to Inspector <a href="/jane-teng/3005-25876" data-ref-id="3005-25876">Jane Teng</a>, whom he agrees to help with various investigations around the city outside of his undercover operation.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">The game was revealed to the press at GDC 2010. In the demo given, <a href="/united-front-games/3010-6705" data-ref-id="3010-6705">United Front</a> emphasized their focus on recreating the sort of action seen in Hong Kong action movies. That means that a big focus of the game will be put on melee combat and environmental moves, in combination with the game's take on <a href="/parkour/3015-272" data-ref-id="3015-272">parkour</a> and free-running. The game's shooting will feature both feature a manual mode and a lock-on system, since a lock-on system will be easier to use in combination with the <a href="/parkour/3015-272" data-ref-id="3015-272">free-running</a> and melee elements. Since there are former <a href="/ea-black-box/3010-1639" data-ref-id="3010-1639">Black Box</a> employees at <a href="/united-front-games/3010-6705" data-ref-id="3010-6705">United Front Games</a>, the driving in the game will be very similar to the <a href="/need-for-speed/3025-483" data-ref-id="3025-483">Need for Speed</a> series of games.</p><p style="">Playing as Wei Shen the player completes various missions from both sides of the law. Depending on how you complete your mission plays a huge part on how much experience you gain from the police and triad. By completing police missions, lessening nearby environment destruction, and reducing the amount of innocent civilians killed will result in an increase to your police xp. As compared to completing triad missions and defeating your opposition in brutal ways such as environment kills will increase your triad xp. As players gain more police xp and triad xp they are given ability points which allow players to customize their players skills.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="medium" data-ref-id="1300-2278795" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12565/2278795-sd_0047.jpg" data-ratio="0.56154628687691" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12565/2278795-sd_0047.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2278795"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/12565/2278795-sd_0047.jpg"></a><figcaption>Fights mostly involve melee combat</figcaption></figure><p style="">The game has on foot, free-running sequences. In these sequences, the player is chasing a criminal. As a Wei runs, he pushes people out of the way and vaults over objects. Hong Kong has been mapped in such a way that it's adapted to the game play. During these chase sequences, the player will engage in hand-to-hand combat. Wei can use his fists, as well as weapons such as knives, meat cleavers and the environment. Enemies can be pushed into TVs, have their faces run against vents and and be thrown from rooftops. The game also has a counter system where an enemy flashes red to indicate when a counter can be performed.</p><p style="">The melee combat is reminiscent of <a href="/batman-arkham-asylum/3030-23245" data-ref-id="3030-23245">Batman: Arkham Asylum</a> and <a href="/batman-arkham-city/3030-29443" data-ref-id="3030-29443">Batman: Arkham City</a>, bringing a similar timing and counter based approach to fights. The main attack button can be done in normal and heavy versions by tapping or holding to button, the counter button can (and should) be hit when an enemy is highlighted red, and the grapple button allows you to grab most enemies. Once grappled you can punch, throw, drag, or preform a variety of environmental attacks, which range from throwing in a dumpster to shoving a persons head into an incinerator. Wei also has the ability to lock onto enemies which allows for more precise and creative attack patterns. A specific side quest allows Wei to learn more combos to help him take down foes in even more ways.</p><figure data-align="left" data-size="medium" data-ref-id="1300-2293622" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48227/2293622-screen_shot_2012_08_15_at_8.45.30_am.png" data-ratio="0.55692055692056" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:55.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48227/2293622-screen_shot_2012_08_15_at_8.45.30_am.png" data-ref-id="1300-2293622"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/48227/2293622-screen_shot_2012_08_15_at_8.45.30_am.png"></a><figcaption>The skill tree allows Wei to unlock new moves</figcaption></figure><p style="">The game incorporates the <a href="/cell-phone/3055-342" data-ref-id="3055-342">cell phone</a> function that has become a feature in many open world games, most notably <a href="/grand-theft-auto-iv/3030-20457" data-ref-id="3030-20457">GTA IV</a>. Using his phone Wei can call contacts (Triad Members, Girls, Police handlers, etc) to gain access to side/miscellaneous quests. There is also a text feature, but it always sends scripted messages that are used in the context of a mission. Wei can access the variety of CI Reports, Background info, and surveillance gatherings through the reports tab, access the social hub, and during some missions take pictures.</p><p style="">One of the key features of the game is known as Face. It has several passive advantages to help the player outside of combat, such as making consumables last longer, discounts, and additional contacts, but it is most obvious in combat. Dealing damage (it seems that more impressive attacks/counters will help more) will fill up the Face Meter, and once it is filled up, Wei regenerates health, intimidates enemies, and through unlocks gains additional advantages such as unblockable attacks and reduced damage. Face is upgraded through side missions and goes to level 10.</p><h2>Delayed, Dead, and Delivered</h2><figure data-align="right" data-size="medium" data-ref-id="1300-1399328" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2164/1399328-truecrime_screenshot05_1600.jpg" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2164/1399328-truecrime_screenshot05_1600.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1399328"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2164/1399328-truecrime_screenshot05_1600.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2164/1399328-truecrime_screenshot05_1600.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The game in its True Crime days</figcaption></figure><p style="">In 2009, shortly after <a href="/activision/3010-78" data-ref-id="3010-78">Activision</a> put the old <a href="/true-crime/3025-257" data-ref-id="3025-257">True Crime</a> moniker on it, the game was delayed through 2011.

src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/81005/2305413-darksiders2_2012_08_14_23_05_00_26.png"></a><figcaption>The game's evolving title screen.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Vigil Games allegedly began working on the sequel just a couple of months after releasing the original <a href="/darksiders/3030-20991" data-ref-id="3030-20991">Darksiders</a>. At the <a href="/igda/3015-4949" data-ref-id="3015-4949">IGDA</a> Leadership Forum, <a href="/danny-bilson/3040-14620" data-ref-id="3040-14620">Danny Bilson</a> mentioned further details regarding the future Darksiders title during his keynote speech. It was revealed that in Darksiders II, a new character will take center stage as the main protagonist, not <a href="/war/3005-997" data-ref-id="3005-997">War</a>. While the sequel's protagonist is not War, the Apocalypse only happens once so the story will be set concurrently with the first game. For the July 2011 issue of Game Informer magazine, it was revealed the new protagonist is <a href="../../death/94-11419/" rel="nofollow">Death</a>.</p><p style="">Darksiders was released in the US on August 14, 2012 for <a href="../../pc/60-94/" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="../../playstation-3/60-35/" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 3</a> and <a href="../../xbox-360/60-20/" rel="nofollow">Xbox 360</a>; the game was released a week later, August 21st, in Europe. The game was also a launch title for the <a href="/wii-u/3045-139" data-ref-id="3045-139">Wii U </a>on November 18, 2012 in the US and November 30 in Europe. A version for the PS4 was <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/articles/darksiders-2-definitive-edition-confirmed-for-ps4/1100-6425332" data-ref-id="1100-6425332">confirmed </a>on February 16, 2015.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">The new combat system is much faster, and more reliant on offensive agile maneuvers than War's more tank-like reactive combat; while War, as the incarnation of violence, was able to withstand mighty blows, Death is frailer than his brother, unable to block, and must rely on dodging to avoid damage. Despite the concept being intrinsically tied to War, Wrath is once again the 'magic' of the game, offering up special attacks and abilities to add variety to combat as well as <a href="/secondary-weapons/3015-3303" data-ref-id="3015-3303">secondary weapons</a> for changing up combos and reacting to specific enemy types.</p><p style="">The new <a href="/loot-gathering/3015-161" data-ref-id="3015-161">loot system</a> puts a bigger emphasis on allowing the player to create a version of Death that plays the way they want to, with, for example, items that give more wrath allowing players to be more like a spell caster and weapons designed for <a href="/melee/3015-444" data-ref-id="3015-444">melee</a> giving bonuses to regular combat.</p><h3>RPG Stats</h3><p style="">Stats are now also a big part of the game emphasizing how much more of an <a href="/rpg-elements/3015-3603" data-ref-id="3015-3603">RPG</a> Darksiders II is in comparison to the first game. Although planned for the first game, development constraints prevented the stat system from making its way in but has returned for Darksiders II and is fully utilized to coincide with the loot system.</p><p style="">Death's playstyle is determined by four stats: Strength, Defense, Agility, and Arcane.</p><h3>Weapons and Gear</h3><ul><li><b>A large Two-Handed Mace</b> with an <a href="../../splash-damage/92-347/" rel="nofollow">area-of-effect</a> <a href="/knock-back/3015-1912" data-ref-id="3015-1912">knockback</a>.</li><li><b>Dual wielded <a href="/scythe/3055-95" data-ref-id="3055-95">Scythes</a></b> that merge into one <b>Giant Scythe</b> at the end of each combo.</li></ul><p style="">All weapons have a level of quality and various stats with the strongest being called "Possessed" weapons which can be fed other items in order to grow more powerful. So far gear items that look strikingly similar to those of the first game are;</p><ul><li><b>Deathgrip</b> - primarily used for navigating and traversing the world like War's Abyssal Chain and also has the dual function of pulling smaller enemies/objects towards Death and pulling Death towards larger ones.</li><li><b>The Void Walker</b> - a portal generator for getting to otherwise unreachable areas.</li></ul><p style="">Most weapons and <a href="/armor/3055-574" data-ref-id="3055-574">armor</a> come in the form of loot items such as in an RPG and are fully <a href="/customization/3015-233" data-ref-id="3015-233">customizable</a> but designed to all fit together regardless of combination. Different stats will be better for different specializations.</p><h3>Despair</h3><p style="">Death has his spectral mount <a href="../../despair/94-20527/" rel="nofollow">Despair</a>; much like <a href="../../ruin/94-13601/" rel="nofollow">Ruin</a> in the first Darksiders, Despair acts as Death's mode of fast transportation across the world of Darksiders II. This time around, he has been part of the game design from the beginning, and Despair is available from the start of the game; the is in contrast to Ruin, who was encountered late within the first game, as its environments were supposedly developed prior to Ruin being added to the game as an active mechanic.</p><h3>Reaper Form</h3><p style="">As War had his Chaos form, Death has his Reaper form; a much larger, more powerful super-state that grants far greater amounts of power for a short period of time. Since Death is a more flashy, egotistical character than the brutally pragmatic War, his Reaper form is featured in <a href="/cutscene/3015-22" data-ref-id="3015-22">cutscenes</a> as well.</p><h3>Wrath Powers</h3><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/2305399-darksiders2_2012_08_14_15_10_26_56.png" data-ref-id="1300-2305399" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/2305399-darksiders2_2012_08_14_15_10_26_56.png" data-ref-id="1300-2305399"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/81005/2305399-darksiders2_2012_08_14_15_10_26_56.png"></a></figure><p style=""><b>Harbinger Tree</b></p><ul><li>Teleport Slash</li><li>Harvest</li><li>Unstoppable</li><li>Frenzy</li></ul><p style=""><b>Necromancer Tree</b></p><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/2305401-darksiders2_2012_08_19_14_10_38_56.png" data-ref-id="1300-2305401" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/2305401-darksiders2_2012_08_19_14_10_38_56.png" data-ref-id="1300-2305401"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/81005/2305401-darksiders2_2012_08_19_14_10_38_56.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/81005/2305401-darksiders2_2012_08_19_14_10_38_56.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Death using "Murder".</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Exhume</li><li>Aegis Guard</li><li>Murder</li><li>Bone Storm</li></ul><h2>Story</h2><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/2305423-darksiders2_2012_08_14_17_24_57_99.png" data-ref-id="1300-2305423" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/2305423-darksiders2_2012_08_14_17_24_57_99.png" data-ref-id="1300-2305423"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/81005/2305423-darksiders2_2012_08_14_17_24_57_99.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/81005/2305423-darksiders2_2012_08_14_17_24_57_99.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>New in Darksiders 2 is dialogue wheels.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Set during the same time period as the original game, Death's ultimate goal in Darksiders II is to restore <a href="../../human/92-810/" rel="nofollow">Humanity</a>; the <a href="../../apocalypse/92-4640/" rel="nofollow">Apocalypse</a> was meant to occur once the Human race was ready to join either the side of Good or Evil in the End War, tipping the Balance and ending the war between Darksiders and Lightsiders once and for all. However, because the Apocalypse occurred millenia too soon, Humanity was completely wiped out by the demons who rampaged across the Earth. At the same time, Death seeks to keep his brother War protected during his journey to clear his name after he is framed for causing the Apocalypse.</p><p style="">There is a sub-plot of the game that regards the origins of the four horsemen and their once glorious race known as the Nephilim, as well as further explanation about who The Makers were. There was an official Comic released that focused on the other horseman and it has been hinted many times that they will all appear a lot more in Darksiders II.</p><h2>Development</h2><p style="">Death was designed very differently from War, appearing lean but not emaciated, a distinct contrast to his usual depiction as a cloaked skeleton. His armor is very similar to War's in design, though with Death preferring to forsake any torso or shoulder armor to give him the maximum amount of maneuverability - unlike War, Death cannot block, and relies entirely on dodges to avoid injury.</p><p style="">The four horsemen themselves are the last remaining members of a race known as the Nephilim, incredibly powerful super-beings with varying forms relatively similar to that of humans. The four were controlled by the neutral faction known as the Charred Council, initially represented as three giant stone faces in the first game. The Nephilim were almost wiped out after they declared war on Heaven; it was believed that the role of the species who would sway the Balance in the End War would go to the Nephilim, who were outraged when instead that destiny was given to the mortal race of <a href="/human/3015-810" data-ref-id="3015-810">Humans</a>. The forces of Light wiped out all but four of the Nephilim in the ensuing war.</p><p style="">The primary setting for Darksiders II is a realm of forgotten battlefields and destroyed worlds left behind by countless wars between Heaven and Hell. The major local is known as the Abyssal Plains. The more fantastical setting of Darksiders II has allowed Vigil to expand their artistic style much more thoroughly across the game than in the original since <a href="/earth/3035-65" data-ref-id="3035-65">Earth</a> isn't the primary location this time around.</p><p style="">Town <a href="/hub-world/3015-1855" data-ref-id="3015-1855">hubs</a> with <a href="/non-player-character/3015-967" data-ref-id="3015-967">NPCs</a> will be present offering up the standard RPG tropes of item vendors and <a href="/optional-objective/3015-3461" data-ref-id="3015-3461">optional quest</a> givers.</p><h2>Wii U Version</h2><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2333213-darksiders_ii_wiiu_abilities.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2333213" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2333213-darksiders_ii_wiiu_abilities.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2333213"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2333213-darksiders_ii_wiiu_abilities.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2333213-darksiders_ii_wiiu_abilities.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">The Nintendo Wii U version of the game makes use of the touch screen for inventory/map functions and the gyro sensor in the GamePad for evading enemy attacks. <a href="/off-tv-play/3015-7482" data-ref-id="3015-7482">Off-TV Play</a> is also supported.

developer <a data-ref-id="3010-7132" href="/playdead/3010-7132">Playdead</a> in Copenhagen, <a data-ref-id="3035-2077" href="/denmark/3035-2077">Denmark</a>, with heavy emphasis on ambience. The game is entirely monochromatic, with nothing more than black and white and shades of grey filling the world. There is no map, <a data-ref-id="3015-569" href="/no-hud/3015-569">no HUD</a>, no dialogue or descriptions - indeed, the only word that appears outside of menus at all is the word "Hotel" which appears on two signs. There is also very little music throughout the game, with it only being heard in specific locations and maintaining the minimalist approach in its composition. The game also contains no loading screens, and can be played continuously from start to finish without pause. It was released on July 21st, 2010, the first game to appear on <a data-ref-id="3015-5553" href="/summer-of-arcade-2010/3015-5553">Xbox Live's Summer of Arcade 2010</a>.</p><p style="">The story in <i>Limbo</i> is never properly detailed in the game. The only written source of the game's story can be found on the internet. "Uncertain of his sister's fate, <a data-ref-id="3005-16130" href="/limbo-boy/3005-16130">a young boy</a> enters <a data-ref-id="3015-5751" href="/limbo/3015-5751">Limbo</a>..." This is never stated in the game itself, and players are left to interpret the narrative for themselves.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1404070-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_52.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1404070" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1404070-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_52.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1404070"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1404070-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_52.jpg"></a><figcaption>A puzzle in Limbo.</figcaption></figure><p style=""><i>Limbo</i> is a <a data-ref-id="3015-3124" href="/puzzle-platformer/3015-3124">puzzle-platformer</a>. The game only uses two buttons in addition to movement controls, one to cause the boy to jump, and one for contextual action, such as dragging boxes, pulling levers, or pushing buttons. The boy can grab onto ledges within reach and lower himself from platforms, climb ladders, push and pull objects and also swing from ropes found in the environment. <i>Limbo</i> features a lot of what developer Playdead describes as "trial and death" gameplay, requiring players to die frequently (and gruesomely) in order to fully understand the puzzles. <i>Limbo</i> has an extremely generous checkpoint system with almost instantaneous reloading, usually bringing the boy back to <i>just</i> before he set off a trap or fell into a chasm, minimizing (but not avoiding) player frustration.</p><p style=""><i>Limbo</i> focuses mostly on physics-based puzzles. These puzzles involve the player pulling or pushing objects with true momentum, affecting fluids, and manipulating electromagnetism and gravity to move objects as well as the player. The game introduces a number of different types of puzzles as the game progresses. A frequent puzzle element involves brain slugs which burrow into the boy's head and force him to walk forward, leaving him unable to stop or turn around until he walks into a bright light, which harms the brain slug and makes it turn him around to flee back into the dark. When afflicted by a slug, previously benign areas and easily-avoidable hazards turn into horrific obstacle courses and death traps.</p><h2>Environments</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1404042-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_24.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1404042" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1404042-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_24.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1404042"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1404042-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_24.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1404042-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_24.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Nice and safe in this huge, creepy forest.</figcaption></figure><p style=""><i>Limbo</i>'s environments change as the protagonist journeys through a number of different locations throughout the game. The player plays straight through these environments without any pause or loading screens.</p><p style=""><b>The Forest</b></p><p style="">The first environment of the game. The boy first wakes up in the forest where he then continues on to cross a large river on a boat, battle against the giant spider and first encounter the psychotic natives of <i>Limbo</i>, who appear to be murderous children. The Forest covers the first four chapters of the game. The Forest area has no industrial traits and differs quite a bit from locations in the game's later chapters.</p><p style=""><b>Wasteland</b></p><p style="">The environment then begins to change when the player meets the murderous children. In the background, broken old shacks and trees are seen. Objects that are used in the environment are broken objects like old crates. Crows are seen perched on the old buildings. The player encounters violence from the natives in this area of the game. They chase the boy, trying to kill him using their darts. There are various wooden structures seen throughout this area, obviously built by the natives. Forestry from the opening environment can be seen dotted around the area. The brain slugs, which force their host to walk in one direction only, make their first appearance in this area.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1404052-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_34.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1404052" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1404052-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_34.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1404052"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1404052-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_34.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1404052-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_34.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The game's areas begin to degrade.</figcaption></figure><p style=""><b>The Caves</b></p><p style="">The wasteland areas then move into the caves. The caves' main theme is water. Many of the puzzles seen throughout the caves involve using water to advance and also trying to avoid drowning in said water, as the boy appears to be soluble. Many waterfalls can also be seen in the backgrounds of some areas in the caves. The caves are also the first area of the game where the player goes indoors. The industrial traits of the game begin to appear here. Cogs, levers and metal platforms are seen in the caves, replacing the old wooden structures of the wasteland area.</p><p style=""><b>The Hotel</b></p><p style="">This is the first area of the game to involve a modern/urban theme. When players first enter this environment, they are greeted by a large "HOTEL" sign which must be navigated over to continue. The player then breaks into the hotel via a glass ceiling and continues on their journey. This environment contains puzzles involving elevators and electricity. After the player travels through the Hotel, they exit back outside for a short time before entering the next enviroment, the Industrial Mill.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1404055-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_37.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1404055" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1404055-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_37.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1404055"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1404055-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_37.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1404055-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_37.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The "HOTEL" sign.</figcaption></figure><p style=""><b>Industrial Mill</b></p><p style="">This is the final environment in the game and takes up the most chapters and most of the latter parts of <i>Limbo</i>. There are a number of different concepts which appear here, navigating cogs, gravity puzzles, spinning rooms, avoiding fire from incongruously-placed machine gun turrets, and using electrical magnets. The Industrial Mill differs greatly from the Forest area at the beginning of the game. This area contains less of the strange atmosphere which defines the early part of the game, and focuses more on puzzle-solving then building atmosphere. Once the player breaks free from the mill, by blasting their way through a glass window, they are greeted with the final moment of the game.</p><p style=""><b>Secret Underground Level</b></p><p style="">A hidden area that can only be accessed after finishing the game and finding all of the other eggs, the majority of this area is entirely in darkness, forcing the player to navigate by sound alone. It is one of the most difficult sections of the game. It was added to the PS3 and PC releases, and is tied to the " <a data-ref-id="ding" href="/achievements/ding/116706">Ding!</a>" trophy/achievement. It has not been patched into the 360 release, to punish 360 players for getting the game first.</p><h2>Ending</h2><p style="">The ending to <i>Limbo</i> is quite abrupt and is open to much interpretation. After finishing the final puzzle, the boy is thrown through a pane of glass. On the other side, the boy finds himself in the forest once again. After travelling for a moment, the boy comes across a young girl, the only female seen in the game, and most likely his sister, outside of a treehouse. When the young girl sees the boy, she stands up. The game then abruptly ends and the credits begin to roll. When they player is returned to the main menu, they realize that the scene which has always accompanied the main menu upon loading the game depicts the same area as the ending, but with a decrepit treehouse and flies buzzing around something on the ground, with the most cynical interpretation being that it is the corpses of the boy and his sister.</p><p style="">The ending of the game has a number of interpretations that can be drawn from the proceedings. Since the game is named <i>Limbo</i>, it is reasonable to assume that the game's dream-like world is the religious idea of <a data-ref-id="3015-5751" href="/limbo/3015-5751">limbo</a>. It is believed by some that the boy completes his journey by returning to the place where he once started; a single circular loop, like limbo itself. Some believe that the two children have already died, hence the menu screen, and that meeting each other in the end is the last task they must complete before they can continue to the afterlife. A number of theories exist on the matter and the developers of <i>Limbo</i> have said nothing officially on the subject of the ending.</p><h2>Reception</h2><p style=""><i>Limbo</i> has received very positive critical acclaim. Reviewers applauded the game's graphical and audio presentation as they have not been seen in many games before. <i>Limbo</i>'s "noir" qualities are also a common plus point for many reviewers. Some reviewers praised the game's lack of a proper narrative and that it is shrouded in mystery, but many found this lack of narrative unappealing. A common criticism made on message boards and in reviews was due to the lack of value for the initial $15 asking price. Such complaints were levied against the linearity of the title, the short length (most players are able to complete it in about three hours), and the lack of replay value endemic to puzzle-platformers. Some reviews noted the game's second half abandoned the initial focus on ambience and organic placement of game elements in favour of the introduction of new mechanics and disjointed puzzle areas, leaving the player with an unoriginal yet still technically well-executed platformer. <i>Limbo</i> has scores of 90% and 92% on GameRankings and Metacritic respectively. <a data-ref-id="3040-89869" href="/brad-shoemaker/3040-89869">Brad Shoemaker</a> awarded the game a maximum five stars and included it in his game of the year list.</p><h2>Avatar Awards</h2><p style=""><i>Limbo</i> has 2 <a data-ref-id="3015-3749" href="/avatar-awards/3015-3749">avatar awards</a> to unlock in the Xbox 360 version.</p><ul><li>White Logo T-Shirt - Earn your first achievement</li><li>A Creature from Limbo (prop) - Complete the game</li></ul><h2>Acclaim</h2><ul><li><i>Limbo</i> was awarded the "Excellence in Visual Arts" and "Technical Excellence" awards at the 2010 Independent Games Festival.</li><li><i>Limbo</i> has also won 3 Milthons at the 2010 <a href="http://www.milthon.com/" rel="nofollow">European Games Awards</a> including the one for <a href="http://www.milthon.com/palmares-2010.html" rel="nofollow">Game of the Year</a>.</li><li>Voted "Best Indie Game" in <a href="http://blog.us.playstation.com/2012/03/06/2012-psn-gamers-choice-awards-and-the-winners-are/" rel="nofollow">Playstation Network's Gamers' Choice Awards 2012</a> (voted online by the community), and went on sale for 30% off (50% off for Playstation Plus Members).</li></ul><h2>PC System Requirements</h2><ul><li><strong>Operating System:</strong> Windows XP, Vista, 7</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 2 GHz</li><li><strong>RAM Memory:</strong> 512MB</li><li><strong>Hard Disk Space:</strong> 150MB</li><li><strong>Video Card:</strong> 5 years or younger.

It supports local and online multiplayer, and is regularly updated with new content and features.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Fully released on November 18th, 2011, Minecraft is a game based around mining various kinds of minerals out of the ground and then building things using those minerals. The game is played from a <a href="/first-person-perspective/3015-330" data-ref-id="3015-330">first-person perspective</a> with the ability to toggle to <a href="/third-person-perspective/3015-464" data-ref-id="3015-464">third-person</a>. The game was originally developed by <a href="/markus-persson/3040-97855" data-ref-id="3040-97855">Markus "Notch" Persson</a> and his development studio, <a href="/mojang-ab/3010-7279" data-ref-id="3010-7279">Mojang AB</a>, and is now under the direction of <a href="/jens-bergensten/3040-99838" data-ref-id="3040-99838">Jens "Jeb" Bergensten</a>. Music and sound design is provided by <a href="/daniel-rosenfeld/3040-99250" data-ref-id="3040-99250">Daniel "C418" Rosenfeld</a>.</p><p style="">Since the Alpha stage of development, Minecraft has received much attention and critical acclaim. It officially broke the two-million sales mark on April 23, 2011, while still in Beta. As of April 27, 2012, more than twenty-seven million accounts have been registered, and the game has sold nearly eight million copies. In September of 2014 <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/articles/microsoft-is-buying-minecraft/1100-5019" data-ref-id="1100-5019">Mojang was acquired by Microsoft</a>, bringing the Minecraft franchise under the umbrella of <a href="/microsoft-studios/3010-340" data-ref-id="3010-340">Microsoft Studios</a>. At the time of the acquisition, <a href="http://news.microsoft.com/2014/09/15/minecraft-to-join-microsoft/" rel="nofollow">Microsoft announced</a> that the PC version of the game had been downloaded more than 100 million times.</p><h2>Gameplay Basics</h2><h3>Starting Out</h3><p style="">When creating a new game in Minecraft, a world is generated and the player is spawned at a random spot. That spot is the player's spawn point and will remain their fixed spawn point until the player rests in a bed. From that point on the bed becomes their new spawn point. The world continues to generate around the player in all directions for a while, and as the player moves around the world more will be generated. The world is stored in 16x16 cubes of blocks, called chunks. The world is created of same-sized blocks. The most common of these are dirt, sand and stone. Everything in Minecraft revolves around obtaining these blocks, placing them in the world, and crafting them into useful items.</p><p style="">To collect blocks, the player left-clicks on a block and cracks will appear in it. If they continue to left-click until the cracks fill the block, the block will shatter dropping a miniature version of itself (or a particular material depending on the block type). The time it takes to collect a block depends on the block the player is collecting and the tool (if any) that they are using. Most mineral-based blocks will require the proper tool to be harvested (stone will not yield cobblestone unless mined with a pick, snow tiles will not yield snowballs unless harvested with a shovel, etc.). Once collected, initial blocks will be placed into the player's hotbar (from left to right), with spillover collecting into the rest of the player's inventory. To place a block, equip it in the hotbar (with either the mouse wheel or corresponding number key) and right-click on another block. [NOTE: Some blocks when collected will yield an item instead of a block (such as diamond or coal) this item cannot be placed and right-click will do nothing.] Take care when using tools as using the incorrect tool on a specific block type will waste two uses of the tool instead of just one (for instance, using a pickaxe on a tree).</p><p style="">Collecting blocks is only the first part of playing Minecraft, then comes crafting, which is more important. In the inventory screen (Default hotkey: E) there is a 2x2 square grid used for crafting. To craft an item, the player must place the correct ingredients in the correct shape in the grid. Some items can be created with very simple diagrams (i.e. a single block of wood will create four wooden planks), while others can be very complicated. One very important early game craft is to create a workbench (which allows players to craft in a 3x3 square allowing them to create more advanced items). A workbench is created with four planks; one placed in each spot of the 2x2 grid.</p><p style="">Once players have crafted a workbench, the next step is crafting tools like shovels and axes. These allow players to gather blocks more quickly and collect more advanced blocks. After a player makes tools the rest of the game is up to them. Players can mine for rare ore, build elaborate structures and much more.</p><p style="">Why craft all of these items? The main point of beta mode is survival, and that's a problem because of monsters. Monsters spawn during the night or anywhere that it is dark. Players have to create shelters to prevent monsters from getting in, lighting to keep monsters from spawning, and of course weapons to defend against monsters. The bulk of Minecraft's gameplay is spent finding ways to improve monster killing/protection.</p><h3>Weather</h3><p style="">As of update 1.5, Minecraft has weather in the form of rain, snow and thunderstorms. Rain will occur, if rarely, in all biomes except desert, tundra and taiga, and snow will fall only in the tundra and taiga biomes. Instances of both of these weather effects will last approximately 15 minutes, and thunderstorms may occur during either. During thunderstorms the world becomes darker, dark enough that enemy mobs may spawn, and lightning strikes setting fire to the block it hits. Snow fall will cover most blocks in snow and cause water to freeze and become blocks of ice.</p><h3>Stats and Achievements</h3><p style=""><a href="/stat-tracking/3015-255" data-ref-id="3015-255">Stats</a> and <a href="/achievements/3015-29" data-ref-id="3015-29">achievements</a> were added to the game in version 1.5. The stats are not retroactive, so they only track what players have done since the update. Stats track information like the distance traveled, the number of each kind of block the player has mined and placed, amount of time played, the number of times the player has jumped, and other such things.</p><h2>Blocks</h2><p style="">The following is a complete list of the blocks present in Minecraft as of version 1.2.5. They are listed by their data values as used in the game's code. Items marked with an asterisk cannot be obtained without the use of a memory editor. Certain blocks with identical functions are identified with the same code with an extra digit appended to indicate a different appearance.</p><table><thead><tr><th>ID</th><th>Block Name</th><th>Block Description</th><th>Appearance</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0*</td><td>Air</td><td>Air is spontaneously generated in any area which is not currently holding a block. It has no effect on the player.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Stone</td><td>Stone is the most abundant block in Minecraft, making up the majority of its cave systems and rock formations. It cannot be obtained without the use of a pickaxe, and drops cobblestone when mined successfully.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Grass</td><td>Grows on top of dirt when enough light is present. Hoeing grass has a chance to produce grass seeds, which can be planted to grow wheat.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Dirt</td><td>Dirt covers most of the surface of the world in Minecraft. It has little use beyond being a makeshift building material, though it can be hoed to produce farmland (see block ID 60).</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Cobblestone</td><td>Produced automatically when stone is mined, or when lava runs over water. Its properties are otherwise identical to that of stone.</td></tr><tr><td>5-0</td><td>Oak Planks</td><td>All planks are crafted from logs of their respective wood type. Planks make a good (albeit flammable) building material, and can be used in a multitude of crafting recipes.</td></tr><tr><td>5-1</td><td>Spruce Planks</td><td>See above.</td></tr><tr><td>5-2</td><td>Birch Planks</td><td>See above.</td></tr><tr><td>5-3</td><td>Jungle Planks</td><td>See above.</td></tr><tr><td>6-0</td><td>Oak Sapling</td><td>Tree saplings drop from decayed leaves on tree which have been cut down.

The player can only survive for a finite amount of time underwater before he begins to asphyxiate.</td></tr><tr><td>9*</td><td>Water Source</td><td>Generates water.</td></tr><tr><td>10*</td><td>Lava</td><td>Self-explanatory.</td></tr><tr><td>11*</td><td>Lava Source</td><td>Generates lava.</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Sand</td><td>Sand is found in deserts. It is the only block which permits the planting of cacti. It is also one of only two solid blocks that obey physics.</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Gravel</td><td>Gravel is the only solid block other than sand that obeys physics. It occasionally yields flint as a drop instead of gravel.</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>Gold Ore</td><td>Gold ore can be mined using a pickaxe and smelted to produce gold ingots. Its characteristics are otherwise identical to those of stone.</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>Iron Ore</td><td>Iron ore can be mined using a pickaxe and smelted to produce iron ingots. Its characteristics are otherwise identical to those of stone.</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>Coal Ore</td><td>Coal ore can be mined with a pickaxe to produce coal.

This block no longer has any practical use.</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>Glass</td><td>Is transparent, allowing the player to make windows and skylights. Windows are now able to use panes (see block ID 102) instead.</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>Lapis Lazuli Ore</td><td>Lapis Lazuli ore can be mined using a pickaxe to produce lapis lazuli. Its characteristics are otherwise identical to those of stone.</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>Lapis Lazuli Block</td><td>Crafted from nine lapis lazuli. Has no practical use.</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>Dispenser</td><td>Launches items a short distance when provided with power.

There are four kinds of mobs: passive, neutral, hostile, and utility.</p><h3>Passive Mobs</h3><p style="">Passive Mobs will not attack the player under any circumstances.</p><p style=""><b>Cow</b></p><p style="">Cows are useful for two reasons, 1. They can be killed for leather which is used to make the lowest level of armor in the game, and 2. With a bucket players can harvest milk from cows. Since the beta 1.8 Adventure update, cows will draw raw beef which can be cooked to make steak</p><p style=""><b>Pigs</b></p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/35470/1636110-minecraft_pig_knows_what_you_did_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1636110" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.87" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:87.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/35470/1636110-minecraft_pig_knows_what_you_did_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1636110"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/35470/1636110-minecraft_pig_knows_what_you_did_2.jpg"></a><figcaption>Squeal, Piggy!</figcaption></figure><p style="">Pigs can be killed for pork chops which serve as the primary healing item in the game. Eating raw pork chops heals a couple of hearts, but if placed in a furnace they become cooked pork chops which heals six hearts. If a pig is struck by lightning during a thunderstorm then it will become a zombie pigman; a mob otherwise only found in the hell underworld of the Nether.</p><p style=""><b>Chickens</b></p><p style="">Chickens can be killed for feathers; feathers are used to make arrows. If left alive, however, chickens can leave eggs on the ground. Since the beta 1.8 Adventure Update, chickens drop raw chicken when killed which can be cooked in a furnace.</p><p style=""><b>Sheep</b></p><p style="">Originally sheep could be punched with any non-tool to shear them for 1-3 blocks of wool. After beta patch 1.7, however, punching sheep does not accomplish anything. And while sheep drop wool upon dying, it is only a single block. Sheep must now be sheared with actual shears which harvest 1-3 wool per sheep. As of update 1.1, sheep now eat grass to re-grow their wool.</p><p style=""><b>Squid</b></p><p style="">Introduced with beta 1.2, these mobs spawn only in water with a slight chance of spawning in the shallows. While these animals are peaceful they can be killed to gain ink packets. These packets can be used to dye wool black.</p><p style=""><b>Villagers</b></p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8960/2136565-villagers.gif" data-ref-id="1300-2136565" data-size="small" style="width: 150px" data-ratio="1.9933333333333" data-width="150" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:199.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8960/2136565-villagers.gif" data-ref-id="1300-2136565"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8960/2136565-villagers.gif"></a><figcaption>A Villager</figcaption></figure><p style="">Villagers are the NPCs who spawn in procedurally-generated villages. Originally they were meant to have names, though every last one of them had "Testificate" in their name plate -- a nickname that has stuck with them since their inception. Clearly inhuman, the villagers never interact with the player and they are completely passive; not even fighting back if attacked by the player. Although most mobs ignore them completely, at night NPC villages come under attack from massive groups of zombies (as seen below) who will go to such lengths as breaking down wooden doors in order to get at the delicious villagers inside. To protect themselves, villagers construct Iron Golems, incredibly powerful constructs who will protect their masters to the death.</p><h3>Neutral Mobs</h3><p style="">These mobs will leave the player alone until provoked. The action causing provocation and the behavior of the mobs after they have been provoked differs between mobs.</p><p style=""><b>Zombie Pigmen</b></p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64233/1676250-342px_zombiepigmsword.png" data-ref-id="1300-1676250" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="1.7514619883041" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:175.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64233/1676250-342px_zombiepigmsword.png" data-ref-id="1300-1676250"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64233/1676250-342px_zombiepigmsword.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64233/1676250-342px_zombiepigmsword.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>A Zombie Pigman</figcaption></figure><p style="">Only found in the Nether, or if a pig is hit by lightning, Zombie Pigmen are peaceful with the player and will not attack unless provoked. They passively wander around and make sounds crossed between pigs and zombies. They become hostile and make loud angry shrieks when attacked or damaged, at which point any other Zombie Pigmen in the area also become hostile. A single player is generally no match for a group of angry Zombie Pigmen. They wield Golden Swords and drop cooked pork chops upon death. Textures exist within the game for a non-zombie Pigman creature, but there is, as of yet, no way to encounter one.</p><p style=""><b>Wolves</b></p><p style="">Introduced in Beta 1.4, wolves are the game's first tameable pet. They can be tamed by feeding them 5-6 bones. Once tamed, hearts will appear and a red collar is present on their neck. The player can tame more than one. The wolves will follow the player character and teleport to them if they get too far away. If the player right-clicks on them they will sit, and if the player feeds them pork chops they will regain health. Their health meter is represented by their tail (vertical tail is full health, lowered is low health). They will attack any players or mobs that the player character attacks, and defend them. Mobs will not attack them. In the wild they are neutral but will attack if provoked. They are somewhat rare but commonly found in forest-type areas.</p><p style=""><b>Ocelots/Cats</b></p><p style="">Introduced in 1.2 of the full release, ocelots only spawn in the also-added jungle biomes, and while they will flee the player instead of engaging them if attacked, they will purposely hunt down and kill chickens. Like wolves, ocelots can be tamed, this time with the use of raw fish. However, unlike wolves, ocelots scare easily and will flee at high speeds (the only mob currently capable of sprinting) if the player moves or even <i>looks around</i> too suddenly near them. Once tamed ocelots inexplicably transform into house cats which come in three different varieties: tabby, siamese and tuxedo. Unlike tamed wolves, cats are not combat pets and will not defend their master if attacked by mobs (although they will still hunt chickens).</p><p style=""><b>Enderman</b></p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8960/1851496-enderman.png" data-ref-id="1300-1851496" data-size="small" style="width: 200px" data-ratio="1" data-width="200" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8960/1851496-enderman.png" data-ref-id="1300-1851496"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8960/1851496-enderman.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8960/1851496-enderman.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>An Enderman</figcaption></figure><p style="">The Endermen were added starting in Beta 1.8. Technically neutral, groups of endermen will slowly wander around picking up blocks and moving them around (making them the only mob capable of directly interacting with the world's blocks apart from creepers destroying them with their explosions). However, if the player looks <i>directly</i> at an individual enderman by placing their central reticule over one, it will stand motionless and stare back at them until they look away. At this point, the enderman has become hostile. Afterwards, the enderman will remain perfectly still while the player is looking at them, and run towards them extremely fast while their back is turned. In addition, endermen who are not being watched have the ability to teleport about once a second. Because of their similar appearance and names it is commonly thought that the endermen were inspired by "Slender Man," a fictional cryptid invented on the Something Awful forums. Some have suggested that the Minecraft mob should have a more unique name, with "Far Lander" being suggested after the area towards the extreme edges of a Minecraft world, known as the Far Lands. Notch has made it clear that he will not be changing the enderman name, and that he would be more likely to change the Far Lands to "the End". This was later revealed as a sly reference to the secret home of the endermen; an alternate dimension called the End.</p><p style=""><b>Iron Golems</b></p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56742/2149210-village_golem.png" data-ref-id="1300-2149210" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="1.910447761194" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:191.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56742/2149210-village_golem.png" data-ref-id="1300-2149210"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/5/56742/2149210-village_golem.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/5/56742/2149210-village_golem.png"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">Introduced in 1.2 of the full release, Iron Golems are the automatons created by the villagers to protect them from the zombie hordes. Incredibly powerful, with more health than any other Minecraft mob save the Enderdragon, golems are completely harmless to the player unless deliberately provoked. On occasion, iron golems will approach villager children and present them with roses, a reference to a scene from the film <i>Castle in the Sky</i>. Although they will automatically engage zombies upon detecting them, iron golems will also do battle with any mob that damages a villager in it's vicinity. They will also protect the player in this manner, making them handy to have around. The player can also construct their own golems, should they wish.

They are also only a single block tall but two blocks wide, often getting past barriers meant for the humanoid enemies. They make loud hissing noises and have no footsteps. Spiders are docile during the day-time but will still attack if attacked first.

They have movement patterns almost identical to zombies, but Creepers make absolutely no noise unless within attack distance, at which point they will make a loud hissing noise (similar to an old-fashioned bomb's fuse being lit), promptly before swelling up and exploding. This leaves the player about a second to get out of the blast radius. The explosion is 75% the strength of TNT, and like TNT it destroys blocks around it and does less damage the further the player character is from the epicenter. Sometimes when a creeper is triggered and the player moves away quickly enough, the creeper will recede to its normal size and will not explode. Creepers drop gunpowder when killed by normal means but will not drop anything if they detonate. They also have a chance of dropping an LP record if they are killed by a skeleton's arrow. If a lightning bolt strikes a creeper or hits very near one, they will become electrified and supercharged. Their explosion is then 50% more powerful than TNT and will usually be a one hit kill.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64233/1676246-slime1.png" data-ref-id="1300-1676246" data-size="small" style="width: 289px" data-ratio="0.77162629757785" data-width="289" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:77.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64233/1676246-slime1.png" data-ref-id="1300-1676246"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64233/1676246-slime1.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64233/1676246-slime1.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Some Slimes</figcaption></figure><p style=""><b>Slimes</b></p><p style="">Slimes are a very rare enemy that only spawn deep underground in special chunks of the world. Certain programs or mods can be used to find where they can spawn (mainly useful for creating a slime farm). As of now in the current Minecraft 1.8, slimes are limited to spawning between the layers of 0-16, but as of 1.9 pre-release this had been expanded to 0-40. Their attack is similar to a spider's as they simply jump towards the player, albeit not as ferociously. Slimes can spawn in various sizes, merging when they stay close enough to one another for long enough. The smallest slimes cannot do damage to the player. They also can only move around by jumping making plopping sounds as they land. They drop balls of green slime when killed which can be used (along with a piston) to create sticky pistons and both push and pull blocks. Slimes also spawn on peaceful difficulty (no enemies) but do no damage.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64233/1676248-ghast.png" data-ref-id="1300-1676248" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="1.3976608187135" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:139.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64233/1676248-ghast.png" data-ref-id="1300-1676248"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64233/1676248-ghast.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64233/1676248-ghast.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>A Ghast</figcaption></figure><p style=""><b>Ghasts</b></p><p style="">Mostly found in the Nether, Ghasts are huge, floating ghostly creatures that are characterized by their constant moaning when idle and blood-curdling screams when attacking. They launch explosive fireballs at the player that will destroy surrounding blocks, much like a creeper's explosion. It is possible to bounce the fireballs back at the ghast either by timing a hit on it with a sword or by shooting it with a bow and arrow. If a ghast manages to hit the player's portal to the real world with its fireball, the portal will close and will need re-igniting in order for the player to be able to leave. When ghasts are killed they drop gunpowder.</p><p style="">Notch has added a small chance that ghasts can spawn near active portals in the real world in the 1.5 update. However, this is not as terrible as it sounds given that the real world, unlike the Nether, has no ceiling, Ghasts in the real world will mainly just float off into the sky and harmlessly fly around the cloudline.</p><p style=""><b>Spider Jockey</b></p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/131021/1796831-200px_skelespider.png" data-ref-id="1300-1796831" data-size="small" style="width: 200px" data-ratio="1.11" data-width="200" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:111.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/131021/1796831-200px_skelespider.png" data-ref-id="1300-1796831"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/131021/1796831-200px_skelespider.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/131021/1796831-200px_skelespider.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>The dreaded Spider Jockey</figcaption></figure><p style="">Spider jockeys, a spider being ridden by a skeleton, are very rare to see.

The game still treats the mob as two separate entities, though, with the spider and the skeleton having separate health and when one is killed the other will remain.

They usually spawn from monster spawners inside Nether Fortresses. Like most spawners, it will start spawning when the player comes within 16 blocks of the spawner. When they encounter the player, they will start flying and throwing fire charges at the player. When killed by the player they will drop Blaze rods.</p><h2>Difficulty Levels</h2><p style="">The game has four difficulties as well as a Hardcore Mode.</p><h3>Peaceful</h3><p style="">Peaceful mode was originally intended for players who preferred to build creatively, but the advent of Creative Mode caused this to become obsolete. However, it is still a viable option for players wishing to become accustomed to the more difficult mechanics of Survival Mode, such as gathering food and avoiding falling off cliffs or into lava. On peaceful mode hostile mobs still spawn but are removed the next time the world updates (1/20 second later). Players can gather food but the food bar does not deplete and thus they cannot eat.</p><h3>Easy</h3><p style="">Mobs spawn but deal insignificant damage. Creepers will "forgive" the player and stop their fuse a short distance away. Players are unable to be poisoned by cave spiders. The food bar will deplete but the player will only suffer starvation damage down to 50% health.</p><h3>Normal</h3><p style="">Mobs deal more damage. The game seems most "realistic" on this level. When the food bar is depleted players will suffer starvation damage down to 5% health.</p><h3>Hard</h3><p style="">Significantly harder than normal. Mobs deal significant damage and will path towards the player over longer distances. Creeper explosions are difficult to cancel. Poison can cripple the player, and it is possible to die from starvation damage.</p><h3>Hardcore Mode</h3><p style="">New in the game's full release, Hardcore mode is nearly identical to Hard difficulty, but with two major caveats: The player cannot change the difficulty mid-game, and upon death the world is deleted.</p><h2>Development</h2><h3>Minecraft Classic</h3><h4>"Creative"</h4><p style="">Notch began development of a "cave game" on May 10, 2009. Over the next week he designed a very basic engine, using his own physics, lighting, and fluid dynamics. Worlds were automatically generated on first spawn from May 16 on. On May 17, the game entered distribution from Minecraft.net with free and premium accounts allowing premium users to save levels and spawn points on a server supported by Notch. Multiplayer support was added on June 8, and support for customized skins was added on June 14. The Classic version now available for free on the Minecraft website is version 0.0.23a_01, released on July 12.</p><h4>Survival Test</h4><p style="">August 4th saw the introduction of "Survival Mode" as a new style of play. The player spawned with no items and had an inventory with limited space; blocks could be broken to yield items to build with. Hostile "mobs" (mobiles) such as skeletons, zombies and spiders spawned in the dark and attacked the player. Rain was also added as the first kind of variable weather. The addition of TNT made it possible for the player to put up slightly more of a defense. Minecraft took its last steps of initial development with the addition of a dynamic lighting engine on December 22.</p><h3>Early Development</h3><h4>Indev</h4><p style="">The Indev (In Development) stage of Minecraft's life brought it closest to the game it is currently, adding an inventory, crafting, specialized tools, torches, smelting, and enhanced A.I. Indev levels could be generated to different themes, such as general weather conditions or even levels resembling heaven and hell. Players were spawned in a rectangular house stocked with the supplies they needed to thrive in the Minecraft world. Indev also saw the addition of farming to Minecraft, which gave players and alternative early in the game to restore health.</p><h4>Infdev</h4><p style="">Notch's purpose for Infdev (Infinite Development) was to create a viable procedural generation system from Minecraft. The system was first tested on February 27, 2010, and went through numerous changes until the advent of Alpha in late June of 2010. Though Infdev was comprised primarily of improvements to physics and appearance, there were also numerous content additions including signs, doors, ladders, mine carts, and mob drops.</p><h3>Minecraft Alpha</h3><p style="">Though technically on the same development cycle as Indev and Infdev, Notch gave the game the "Alpha" suffix to indicate that the game was now moving at full speed toward release. The vast majority of Minecraft's content additions took place during Alpha, often through "Seecret Friday" updates where Notch intentionally neglected to provide the players with changelists so they could find the additions themselves. The addition of redstone and device automation marked a significant milestone in players' ability to customize structures and streamline simple actions such as opening doors. The game was also provided with a logic engine allowing players to build computers and other complex devices. Mob A.I. received yet another upgrade in order to prevent pathing into lava or off cliffs. The first visible biomes began to generate into new worlds, with snowfall in cold places and cacti in deserts. The number of placeable blocks now exceeded fifty.</p><p style="">Perhaps one of the biggest milestones in Minecraft's development, Survival Multiplayer (SMP), was patched in on August 4, 2010. In preparation for a massive update, Minecraft received mostly insignificant tweaks and bug fixes for about the next month and a half. On October 4th, the Minecraft Halloween update was announced promising new blocks, new mobs, fishing, and a brand-new biome generator. Most importantly, though, the Halloween update added the Nether to the game; a hellish realm flooded with lava and filled with enemy mobs. The update was applied on October 30th and remains one of the most significant updates in the game's history. The Halloween update also caused a massive number of bugs leading Notch to use the next few months as bug fix time. Most actual updates occurring during this time were esoteric or involved minor game mechanics which did not noticeably alter gameplay.</p><h3>Minecraft Beta</h3><p style="">Minecraft entered Beta on December 20th, 2010. The Beta development period had a wealth of content additions as well as the tweaking of gameplay balance. As Mojang grew, each subsequent major update had a longer and longer changelist. The Beta stage -- especially from 1.5 on -- saw massive improvements to gameplay in mob A.I., inventory management and environment generation. The game's code was overhauled to allow for an improved block I.D. assignment system and a statistics tracker which allowed the insertion of achievements. Update 1.6's changelist contains more than 100 bug fixes in preparation for the next massive update drop.</p><h4>The Adventure Update</h4><p style="">Announced on June 10, 2011, and implemented on September 14th with Beta 1.8, the Adventure Update was designed to make Minecraft feel much more like an RPG by adding hunger, experience and a multitude of new mobs, blocks, biomes and random structures. The combat system received a massive face-lift as well, allowing players to sprint and adding a drawback system for bows. Critical hits could be performed by jumping and hitting a mob on the way down, and mobs could be knocked back a long distance by sprinting and hitting them. The adventure update also added Creative Mode to compensate players who wanted only to build and not be bothered by the hunger system.</p><h4>The Sound Update</h4><p style="">The majority of the work for the so-called "Sound Update" was done by "C418." The patch did not alter gameplay whatsoever, and was silently applied on November 13th. It provided new sounds for chests, doors, fence gates, trapdoors, fishing rods and explosions; as well as a slew of new mob sounds and different injury sounds for the player which were controversial due to the attachment players felt to Steve's signature "ooh" each time he was hurt.</p><h3>Full release</h3><p style="">On his blog, Notch announced that Minecraft's "Full" release date was nigh. Leaving beta, the plan was for Minecraft to reach "Release" on 11/11/11. Though due to scheduling conflicts with Minecon the date was moved one week to 11/18/11. Notch stated that the chances are that the game will be very close to what it is now and that this date is merely a goal for the studio.</p><p style="">When the game was in the Beta stage, it allowed users to pre-order the full version of the game for 75 percent of the price as a special sale.</p><p style="">The game is also able to be "gifted." As of December 12, 2010, there are gift codes available for purchase for the same price as retail. Also, these gift codes can be purchased in packs of 1-10.</p><p style="">A demo version of Minecraft was released on April 19th that allows access to the full game for 90 minutes, after which the game must be purchased to continue.</p><p style="">A version of the game was announced for the <a href="/xbox-360/3045-20" data-ref-id="3045-20">Xbox 360</a> at <a href="/e3-2011/3015-6449" data-ref-id="3015-6449">E3 2011</a>. The Xbox 360 version was released on May 9th, as part of the Arcade NEXT promotion.

It was initially planned to be developed for handheld platforms, however the development staff decided against this and chose the <a href="/playstation-3/3045-35" data-ref-id="3045-35">PlayStation 3</a> as they figured the majority of fans wanted Persona 5 to be an HD experience.</p><h3>Pre-reveal</h3><p style="">In September of 2009, <a href="/shoji-meguro/3040-89612" data-ref-id="3040-89612">Shoji Meguro</a> was listed on Sony's site as the producer for the game.

Hashino will be directing the game, with Shigenori Soejima doing character design and Shoji Meguro as sound composer.</p><p style="">Interviews had stated that the Persona team had developed Catherine as a testbed for Persona 5, however it has been said that they will not be using the <a href="/gamebryo-25/3015-2021" data-ref-id="3015-2021">Gamebryo</a> engine for Persona 5, instead opting for an engine they created specifically for the title.</p><h3>Official Reveal</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="medium" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/35888/2573982-capture.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2573982" data-ratio="0.57229832572298" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:57.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/35888/2573982-capture.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2573982"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/35888/2573982-capture.jpg"></a><figcaption>Teaser from the Persona 5 trailer.</figcaption></figure><p style="">On November 24, 2013, Atlus officially revealed Persona 5 through a live stream.

The chairs featured in the original teaser is a setting from a Japanese high school classroom. The theme of Persona 5 will focus on the emotion of joy after overcoming trials (thus freeing yourself from chains, pictured in the teaser with chains around school chairs), which could be some form of criticism against the strict and stressful Japanese school system.</p><p style=""> </p><p style=""> </p><p style=""> </p><p style=""> </p><p style=""> </p><p style=""> </p><p style=""> </p><p style=""> </p>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month>6</expected_release_month><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year>2016</expected_release_year><id>30486</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/0/3699/2727932-persona+5+v1.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3699/2727932-persona+5+v1.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/0/3699/2727932-persona+5+v1.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3699/2727932-persona+5+v1.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/3699/2727932-persona+5+v1.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/3699/2727932-persona+5+v1.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/0/3699/2727932-persona+5+v1.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Persona 5]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating/><original_release_date/><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-35/]]></api_detail_url><id>35</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 3]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS3]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/]]></api_detail_url><id>146</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 4]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS4]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/persona-5/3030-30486/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-30567/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2010-04-01 12:56:05</date_added><date_last_updated>2015-09-27 07:15:39</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[World of Tanks is a free-to-play (F2P) massively multiplayer online (MMO) team based action game featuring WWII era tank combat.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style=""><i>World of Tanks</i> (WoT) is a <a href="/free-to-play/3015-1308" data-ref-id="3015-1308">free-to-play</a> tank combat game based during early <a href="/world-war-ii/3015-471" data-ref-id="3015-471">WWII</a> to early <a href="/cold-war/3015-1888" data-ref-id="3015-1888">cold war</a> eras. Containing American, British, German, French, Chinese, <a href="/soviet-union/3035-507" data-ref-id="3035-507">USSR</a> and Japanese technology, players jump into random battles and fight together in Last Team Standing/Base Capture hybrid matches. Gameplay elements include Sim, Action, RPG, and Strategy.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">Core gameplay consists of two 15 player teams fighting one another in a death match. The team who either destroys all of the enemy tanks or captures the enemy base is the winner. Teams are made up of Light Tanks, Medium Tanks, Heavy Tanks, Tank Destroyers, and SPGs. The game also has some sim game mechanics, including: armor penetration, different round types, camouflage and ambushing, tank weak spots, inaccuracies while moving the tank/turret, and more.</p><p style="">Before you jump into a game, you select the tank you want to go into battle with at the garage screen. In the garage, you can look at your tanks, buy new parts (modules) to put onto them (this includes cannons, turrets, radios, engines, and tracks) as well as new tanks, manage your tank crews, research new technology and tanks, chat with other people, check profile statistics, and lastly repair any damage on your tanks and resupply their ammunition.</p><p style="">In each battle, you gain experience and credits from a variety of different factors, including scouting enemy tanks, damaging and destroying enemy tanks, contributing to capturing the enemy's base, and more. Tank crews also receive experience after every battle, making them more proficient at their job. Once the crew gains enough experience, they receive access to a set of skills and perks, which improve a specific attribute including, but not limited to, repair speed, vision range, accuracy, and damage.</p><h3>Tanks</h3><p style="">Tanks are split up into 10 tiers and five types. Each player begins the game with a Tier I Light Tank from each of the seven nations currently represented in the game; The United States, Germany, France, The United Kingdom, China, Russia (USSR) and Japan.</p><ul><li><b>Light Tanks</b></li></ul><p style="">Light Tanks are the first type of tank you will drive. They are often referred to as scout tanks or "scouts". They can be the fastest out of any tanks in the game with the best maneuverability. Because of this, though, they generally have rather light armor and weaker cannons. Light Tanks are best used for discovering enemy positions and flanking enemy SPGs and Tank Destroyers.</p><ul><li><b>Medium Tanks</b></li></ul><p style="">Medium Tanks have a solid mix of maneuverability, speed, armor, and firepower. They are at their strongest when in packs, swarming enemy flanks and the more sluggish heavy tanks.</p><ul><li><b>Heavy Tanks</b></li></ul><p style="">Slow, heavily armored, and with powerful cannons, Heavy Tanks are a force to be reckoned with. Heavy Tanks are ideal when leading an attack against an enemy position and soaking up shots while dealing out damage.</p><ul><li><b>Tank Destroyers</b></li></ul><p style="">Tank Destroyers are a defense-oriented tank. They tend to have average to strong frontal armor with stronger cannons, but no turrets, making them ideal for long-range sniping or ambushing.</p><ul><li><b>SPGs</b></li></ul><p style="">SPGs, or Self Propelled Guns, are the backbone of a tank force. Able to lob powerful shells at long range, SPGs can turn the tide of battle if a skilled player is behind the wheel.</p><ul><li><strong>Premium Tanks</strong></li></ul><p style="">Premium tanks are specific light, medium and heavy tanks, that you can buy with the in-game currency, gold. These tanks are equipped with parts that are elite status, so you can enjoy the full power of the tank right from the start. They are generally stronger than stock (non-upgraded) tanks of their tier, but weaker than fully upgraded tanks of their tier.</p><h2>Game Modes</h2><p style="">There are currently three game modes, each putting a different spin on team deathmatch and base conquest style game play. The matchmaker assembles two teams of 15 and then randomly selects a map and battle type (if the map has multiple types associated with it). Each battle begins with the opposing teams on opposite sides of the map.</p><h3>Matchmaking</h3><ul><li><h4><b>Standard Battle</b></h4></li></ul><p style="">Standard battle is the original battle type, formerly known as "Random Battle". In this mode, each team must capture the enemy base or destroy all the enemy tanks before 15 minutes expires to win.</p><ul><li><b>Assault</b></li></ul><p style="">Each team is assigned a role as either attackers or defenders. In this mode, there is only one base. The attackers must destroy all the defending tanks or capture the base before time expires to win. The defenders must destroy all the attackers or successfully defend the base for 10 minutes.</p><ul><li><b>Encounter</b></li></ul><p style="">In this mode there is a single capture point in somewhere along the mid-point of the map towards one of the map's borders (i.e. not dead center). Each team spawns along the opposite border in opposite corners of the map. Each team must destroy all enemy tanks or capture the base before the 15 minute timer expires.</p><ul><li><h4><b>Clan Battles</b></h4></li></ul><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/76612/1806554-browser.png" data-ref-id="1300-1806554" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5707248416608" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:57.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/76612/1806554-browser.png" data-ref-id="1300-1806554"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/76612/1806554-browser.png"></a><figcaption>The Clan Battles add-on with the map of the provinces</figcaption></figure><p style="">Clan battles is a browser-based add-on. You and your clan get to fight for the different provinces on the political map. To enter this mode you need a clan with at least 15 people. Each player that has taken part of a battle of tier 5 or above is represented by a token. The Clan leader uses those tokens to attack provinces and other clans. The Clan Wars are turn-based, each turn lasting a set amount of time. You and your clan will be able to join with other clans to form an alliance, or you can provide your services to other clans as mercenaries.</p><p style="">The entire world will be available to conquer eventually, but as of now only Europe is available. Each province has a certain gold value associated with it, and this amount will be paid out to the occupying clan's members every day, making this an alternative way to acquire gold rather than paying for it.</p><h2>System Requirements</h2><p style=""><b><u>Minimum:</u></b></p><ul><li><strong>Operating system:</strong> Windows XP / Vista / 7 / 8</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 2.2 GHz</li><li><strong>RAM:</strong> 1.5 GB for Windows XP, 2 GB for Windows Vista / 7</li><li><strong>Video Card:</strong> GeForce 6800 / ATI X800 with 256 MB RAM; DirectX 9.0c</li><li><strong>Sound:</strong> DirectX 9.0c compatible</li><li><strong>Hard drive space:</strong> 16 GB</li><li><strong>Internet Speed:</strong> 256 Kbps</li></ul><p style=""><b><u>Recommended:</u></b></p><ul><li><strong>Operating system:</strong> Windows XP / Vista / 7 64-bit / 8</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core 2 Duo 2.5 GHz / AMD AthlonTM 64 X2 5600 2.8 GHz</li><li><strong>RAM:</strong> 4 GB</li><li><strong>Video card:</strong> GeForce 260 / ATI HD4870 w/ 1 GB RAM</li><li><strong>Sound:</strong> DirectX 9.0c compatible</li><li><strong>Hard drive space:</strong> 30 GB </li><li><strong>Internet Speed:</strong> 1024 Kbps or higher (for voice chat)</li></ul>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>30567</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/2615945-box_wot.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/2615945-box_wot.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/2615945-box_wot.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/2615945-box_wot.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/2615945-box_wot.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2615945-box_wot.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/2615945-box_wot.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[World of Tanks]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>0</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-1/]]></api_detail_url><id>1</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: T]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-38/]]></api_detail_url><id>38</id><name><![CDATA[OFLC: PG]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2011-04-12 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-20/]]></api_detail_url><id>20</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[X360]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-86/]]></api_detail_url><id>86</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox 360 Games Store]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360-games-store/3045-86/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[XBGS]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-145/]]></api_detail_url><id>145</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox One]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-one/3045-145/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[XONE]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/]]></api_detail_url><id>146</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 4]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS4]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/world-of-tanks/3030-30567/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases><![CDATA[Exciting Hour

The map shows blips where missions can be started, either story missions (blue) or side missions (yellow).

Spread across the map are 'rampage' icons where the player has to cause as much damage as possible with a specific weapon in a limited amount of time.</p><p style=""><a href="/player/3005-24570" data-ref-id="3005-24570">Player</a>'s appearance can be customised. There are numerous shops around town where players can get a new haircut, tattoos, sunglasses, or even a 'face transplant' to look like the game's developers, or other real life personalities ranging from fellow indie developers to even some games journalists.</p><h2>Aesthetic</h2><p style="">As the title of the game suggests, Retro City Rampage has a deliberately retro look to its design that evokes games of the 8-bit era. The game's title is even patterned after that of the <a href="/nes/3045-21" data-ref-id="3045-21">NES</a> game <a href="/river-city-ransom/3030-6608" data-ref-id="3030-6608">River City Ransom</a>. Retro City Rampage also references other titles of the era, such as a stage that resembles the second stage of <a href="/contra/3030-4350" data-ref-id="3030-4350">Contra</a>, but from the top-down perspective.</p><h3>Display Filters</h3><figure data-ref-id="1300-2186054" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9446/2186054-rcr_videobrick.png" data-size="small" data-align="right" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9446/2186054-rcr_videobrick.png" data-ref-id="1300-2186054"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9446/2186054-rcr_videobrick.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9446/2186054-rcr_videobrick.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>The game can be made to look like various game consoles, such as the Super Game Boy.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Retro City Rampage allows users to use a range of display filters which pay homage to classic gaming machines:</p><ul><li>Entertainment System</li><li>Entertainment Night</li><li>Blurst Processor</li><li><a href="/atari-2600/3045-40" data-ref-id="3045-40">AtaroVision 2599</a></li><li><a href="/commodore-64/3045-14" data-ref-id="3045-14">SEE=64</a></li><li>Granny Smith</li><li>PC DOS EGA</li><li>PC DOS CGA A</li><li>PC DOS CGA B</li><li>PC DOS MDA</li><li>PC WIN16</li><li><a href="/zx-spectrum/3045-16" data-ref-id="3045-16">XZ Moonbeam</a></li><li>Black &amp; White TV</li><li>Pocket Handheld</li><li><a href="/game-boy/3045-3" data-ref-id="3045-3">Brick Handheld</a></li><li><a href="/virtual-boy/3045-79" data-ref-id="3045-79">Virtual Burn</a></li><li>RCR</li></ul><h2>Weapons</h2><p style="">The game features a wide variety of weapons ranging from fists, all the way to an NES style light gun.

This merit is given to new and upcoming independent games of a distinctively high quality that show a great deal of promise. At PAX it was also awarded DIYgamer's Editor's Choice and Machinima's Best Indie Title of the Show as well as being nominated for Destructoid's Game of the Show.

A lot of these references also appear indirectly as shop names and billboards. There are also place names in the game, such as Granville Zone, that are named after real locations in Vancouver, the developer's home town, as well as an area called '<a

Microsoft Surface tablet involving ghost samurai battling it out in feudal Japan.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style=""><i>Skulls of the Shogun</i>, developed by <a href="/17-bit/3010-7157" data-ref-id="3010-7157">17-Bit</a>, is set in a feudal <a href="/japan/3035-37" data-ref-id="3035-37">Japan</a> with an undead twist, that is, all the <a href="/samurai/3015-216" data-ref-id="3015-216">Samurai</a> and whatnot are undead. The game is described by one of the devs, <a href="/jake-kazdal/3040-54134" data-ref-id="3040-54134">Jake Kazdal</a>, as an "arcade style <a href="/tactical-turn-based-combat/3015-234" data-ref-id="3015-234">turn-based strategy game</a>." The developers claim that they were influenced by <a href="/advance-wars/3030-12719" data-ref-id="3030-12719">Advance Wars</a>, but wanted a less rigid form of gameplay. What sets this game apart is that it doesn't use a grid, instead going for analogue controls. Additionally, the developers didn't like the "<a href="/rock-paper-scissors/3015-539" data-ref-id="3015-539">rock, paper, scissor</a>" system seen in the aforementioned Advance Wars and many other strategy games, instead opting for three different and flexible core units with pros and cons that can be used against any other units, depending on how they're used. Additionally, the property based parts of Advance Wars have been streamlined for simplicity and to go with the faster "arcade approach" the developers are going for. This is the first game ever which allows <a href="/cross-platform-multiplayer/3015-4183" data-ref-id="3015-4183">cross platform multiplayer</a> play between <a href="/microsoft-studios/3010-340" data-ref-id="3010-340">Microsoft</a>'s <a href="/pc/3045-94" data-ref-id="3045-94">Windows</a> 8/RT, <a href="/windows-phone/3045-124" data-ref-id="3045-124">Windows Phone</a>, and <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20" data-ref-id="3045-20">Xbox 360</a> platforms. An updated "Bone-A-Fide Edition" of the game was later released for Steam and runs on all version of Windows since XP.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">The game is very different from turn based strategy games in terms of unit control, that is, the game removes the grid system and gives the player direct analogue control over the unit. Units can do multiple things, they can haunt structures or rice fields, attack enemy units, and defend allied units. As far as restrictions on what players can do, this game follows an action point system, that is, everything a player will do will cost a scroll, be it building, moving, attacking, haunting, or otherwise. Prior to setting up the game a player can change the match type, pick the number of armies (players), set a time limit per turns, choose the starting race, and pick a map to play on.</p><p style="">Properties are much different then the typical factories and cities found in other turn based strategy games, instead, there are three structures: rice paddies, shrines, or summoning areas. Rice paddies are where the player gets the main currency of the game, <a href="/rice/3055-3526" data-ref-id="3055-3526">rice</a>. A player can burn an action by making a unit "haunt" the rice paddy, giving resources, but also burning up the rice paddy. And so, in effect, the resources in the game are finite. <a href="/shrine/3035-2373" data-ref-id="3035-2373">Shrines</a> are used to summon special monks who are units with special abilities and spells they can cast, one that was demonstrated was the Fox Monk, which is defense based. Unlike other turn based strategy games with unit building, there is only one unit building in this game. A summoning area where players can use rice to summon units.</p><p style="">There are 3 classes of controllable units.</p><h3>The General</h3><ul><li>[6 Health 6 Attack 3 Defense]</li></ul><h3>The Samurai</h3><ul><li>Cavalry [6 Health 5 Attack 2 Defense]</li><li>Archers [6 Health 6 Attack 1 Defense]</li><li>Infantry [6 Health 5 Attack 3 Defense]</li></ul><h3>The Monks</h3><p style="">Unlike other games, there isn't a set balance of a unit against another, that is, there's no rocks, papers, scissors categories. A cavalry won't always be the best thing against infantry, and archers won't always beat cavalry, it lies more on how a unit is used and managed by the player. However, those are just the core units. As said above, there are special Monks which can use special spells. Additionally, there are the Generals, which are the centerpiece of every game. If the General dies, the game ends. The General, however, is also a very capable unit, and every turn he's not used he gets more powerful.</p><p style="">When a unit is killed, its <a href="/skull/3055-641" data-ref-id="3055-641">skull</a> drops, which another unit can devour. A single unit can eat up to three skulls, which boost abilities - the first skull boosts defense, the second skull boosts offense, and the third skull turns a unit into a completely new, more powerful and strongly upgraded one, in the form of a Demon.</p><p style="">The UI is very simple and straight-forward, and designed to be as easily accessible as possible. Commands are displayed in the corners of the screen (depending on the person, as once it was in the bottom left and the other time it was shown on the bottom right.) On the opposite side of the commands is where a long scroll is displayed with statistics during an attack, of how much life a unit has, how much damage will be dealt, and how much damage will be taken. Additionally it displays the amount of rice, units, and the round. Otherwise, unit health is displayed by a flag that the unit carries with a bar showing health.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style="">You are a famous and prestigious Japanese military general, but in one of your largest fights, you are betrayed and killed. You wake up on the ship of the dead, learning that the man who betrayed you has also died. However, he has taken credit for your accomplishments, and has went on to serve the shogun directly. You then get angry and seek revenge, leading your loyal post-death army to take down those who betrayed you.</p><h2>Game Modes</h2><p style="">Currently, up to four-player local multiplayer support has been announced, and possibly the same for network multiplayer, and of course, a single player campaign. In the multiplayer modes, if one of the players drops out of the fight, an AI will take over his/her army, thus making it possible to continue the match.</p><p style="">Versus offers different multiplayer game modes such as:</p><ul><li><b>Skulls Anywhere</b> - In this variation of versus players find themselves sending turns back and forth at different times. This mode is played against friends using Windows 8/RT, Surface tablets, and also Windows Phone. This mode imply s that there will be long duration between turns since the variety of devices is large.</li><li><b>Skulls Online</b> - This mode offers a straight up online game mode with up to 4 players via Xbox LIVE.</li><li><b>Skulls on the couch</b> - This mode is the game's local multiplayer mode with up to 4 players locally.</li></ul><h2>Bone-A-Fide Edition</h2><p style="">On July 29, 2013, Skulls of the Shogun: Bone-A-Fide Edition for Steam was released. Unlike the initial Windows Store version of the game, this edition can run on Windows XP, Vista, and 7 in addition to Windows 8. Also unlike the initial releases on Xbox 360, Windows Phone, and the Windows Store (for Windows 8 and RT), which had cross-platform play between all devices, Steam users will only be able to play against other Steam users.</p><p style="">Bone-A-Fide Edition includes everything from the original game along with the following:</p><ul><li>A new mini-campaign entitled "The Forgotten Isles"</li><li>Six new multiplayer maps</li><li>A new Monk character</li><li>Developer Commentary</li><li>An experience/player ranking system</li><li>Collectable Emblems</li><li>Steam Trading Cards</li></ul><h2>PC System Requirements</h2><p style="">*These requirements only apply to the Bone-A-Fide Edition for Steam, not the Windows Store version for Windows 8 and

The game also features three-player online co-op, the previous <a href="/trine/3030-24739" data-ref-id="3030-24739">Trine</a> had co-op but was offline only.</p><h2>Multiplayer</h2><p style="">Trine 2 allows all story levels to be played co-op with up to 2 additional players, either online or local. Individual level progress does not matter in multiplayer, as any level can be played even if a participant hasn't reached it yet in single player. Each player will have to play as Amadeus, Zoya, and Pontius.</p><h2>Goblin Menace DLC</h2><p style="">FrozenByte announced a six-level DLC campaign at GamesCom 2012 which was released in September 2012. Entitled Goblin Menace, the add-on includes new environments, enemies, and character abilities (the latter of which will also be usable in the original levels as well).</p><h2>Director's Cut Version</h2><p style="">Trine 2: Director's Cut was released as a launch title for <a href="/wii-u/3045-139" data-ref-id="3045-139">Wii U</a>'s eShop on November 18, 2012. This version includes the Goblin Menace DLC pack. An additional new mode called Magic Mayhem with new levels featuring new gameplay concepts designed around the Wii U GamePad was originally planned but had to be scrapped to make the system's launch. This mode appearing as DLC is still a possibility but not very likely, according to a <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2013/01/13/trine-2s-wii-u-exclusive-magic-mayhem-mode-not-a-likelihood/" rel="nofollow">Frozenbyte statement from January 2013</a>.</p><p style="">The Director's Cut also features optional touch screen controls and <a href="/off-tv-play/3015-7482" data-ref-id="3015-7482">Off-TV Play</a> as well as a post launch patch that adds support for the Wii U Pro Controller. The Japanese Wii U eShop release was localized and published by <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/nintendo/3010-90" data-ref-id="3010-90">Nintendo</a>.</p><h2><b>Soundtack</b></h2><p style="">The original soundtrack was created by the Finnish composer and musician <a href="/ari-pulkkinen/3040-90303" data-ref-id="3040-90303">Ari Pulkkinen</a>.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8485/2607633-trine2_soundtrack_front_cover_special_edition.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2607633" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="1" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8485/2607633-trine2_soundtrack_front_cover_special_edition.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2607633"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8485/2607633-trine2_soundtrack_front_cover_special_edition.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8485/2607633-trine2_soundtrack_front_cover_special_edition.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p style=""><b>Tracklist:</b></p><ol><li>Trine 2 Main Theme — 02:33</li><li>The Story Begins — 02:57</li><li>The Mighty Warrior Pontius — 01:38</li><li>The Mighty Warrior Pontius Part II — 01:38</li><li>Thieves Guild — 01:45</li><li>Mudwater Dale — 03:01</li><li>Waltz of the Temple Forest Elves — 03:45</li><li>Goblins! — 01:12</li><li>Mosslight Marsh — 03:31</li><li>Snake, Oh It’s a Snake! — 01:29</li><li>Petrified Tree — 03:40</li><li>Goblins!

It was announced at <a href="/e3-2010/3015-4529" data-ref-id="3015-4529">E3 2010</a>, and was released on March 13, 2012. Much like their previous two titles, it aims to be more of an unusual, experimental experience rather than a traditional game and is meant to evoke strong emotions from the player. It is the final game in a three-game deal that <a href="/thatgamecompany/3010-5521" data-ref-id="3010-5521">thatgamecompany</a> signed with Sony, and was part of the Spring Fever promotion on PSN. On March 29, 2012, <a href="/jenova-chen/3040-82903" data-ref-id="3040-82903">Jenova Chen</a> announced, on <a href="http://blog.us.playstation.com/2012/03/29/journey-is-psns-fastest-selling-game-soundtrack-coming-soon/" rel="nofollow">his blog</a>, that Journey had become the fastest selling game ever released in the <a href="/sony-computer-entertainment-america/3010-313" data-ref-id="3010-313">SCEA</a> region on the PlayStation Network. On July 21, 2015, Journey was re-released on the Playstation 4 and was cross-buy with the Playstation 3 digital version. </p><h2>Story</h2><p style="">Journey has an ambiguous story that takes place in a ravaged landscape dotted with ruins. When the player begins a new journey, their character is sitting in a desert, with no backstory, name, or apparent purpose besides reaching the glowing mountain in the distance.</p><p style="">During Journey, the player will come upon two direct forms of storytelling. The first form they will encounter is glyphs, mosaic stonework that reveals some of the history of the area. The second form comes in between level visions. In these cutscenes a large white-robed figure shares, in pictographic vignettes, the past, present, and future of the player. The following is a literal interpretation, although many figurative interpretations are no less valid.</p><p style="">The world of Journey wasn't always in ruins. A white-robed culture once thrived here, at first living with nature and soon, with the help of the same power that allows the player's character to fly, overwhelming nature with structures, building higher and higher.</p><p style="">When this power dwindled, the culture split into warring tribes, building mechanical insectoid war machines rather than buildings. The war killed many, explaining the graves littering the landscape as the player progresses.</p><p style="">In its wake, the war left the ruined cities the player sees and the still functioning machines that impede their path.</p><p style="">Not all of this white-robed culture died, though. A final glyph reveals that the remaining few went back to the mountain from whence they came.</p><p style="">The player, meanwhile, is part of an endless cycles of many players journeying to and flying back from the mountain, a progression that makes some players act as newcomers, slowly finding their way, while others become mentors and guides having already found it.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3068/1405918-mountain_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1405918" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3068/1405918-mountain_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1405918"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3068/1405918-mountain_2.jpg"></a><figcaption>Looks like we're in for a long trip.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Journey is a third-person adventure game where players play as a mysterious robed being who embarks on a journey to a mountain that emanates light from its peak.</p><p style="">The player has three distinct modes of interaction. First, they can chirp or shout. By pressing or pressing and holding the circle button, the player creates a bubble of influence and a tone specific to that journeyer. This tone allows the player to communicate with another journeyer. If one journeyer shouts near another, the shout will replenish the other player's jumping ability. Also, shouts can refresh old cloth and scarves throughout the game, giving life to the sentient cloth.</p><p style="">Second, they can fly. In Journey, players can jump and glide through the air, but only as long as their scarf will let them, as it designates how long one can stay airborne. When the player's scarf is lit and its symbols are showing, the player can press or hold the cross button to fly. The scarf can be lengthened, and thus strengthened, by collecting glowing symbols hidden throughout the environments. Besides interaction with other players, the scarf can be replenished through refreshed cloth, that which is also glowing and showing its symbols, and, later, through a mystic, water-like aura. This fact allows players to climb vertically indefinitely until the cloth or aura ends.</p><p style="">Third, they can run or slide. Basic movement on the left analog stick makes the character run. Desert sand can slow the player on an uphill, or quicken them on the downhill. Certain sections of the game revolve around continuous sliding downhill, while feels like a snowboarding game.</p><p style="">Journey tasks the player with solving puzzles to move on to the the next area. Environments are open, but strong winds keep players on the right track. Most puzzles involve freeing old cloth so that it opens up the path for the player. Players are also tasked with avoiding enemies with visible spotlights, as being caught in the light will fling the player and damage their scarf.</p><h2>Multiplayer</h2><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1800963-screenshot0030.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1800963" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1800963-screenshot0030.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1800963"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1800963-screenshot0030.jpg"></a><figcaption>Work together... or don't.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Journey is considered unique when it comes to multiplayer as it doesn't ask you if you want to play with others. It forces co-op onto the player by making them meet with other players at random. The game sees what level the player is on and inserts another player who's on the same level into their game. When another player enters, a white light will appear on the sides of the screen to lead the player to that other person if they want to join them. The only way not to play with others is to log off PSN while playing.</p><p style="">Players can work together by giving each other boosts of power, huddle together for warmth, or simply guide one another across the vast landscape. There is no way to hinder other players.</p><p style="">Players can only encounter others after the first area of the game, which becomes a level select hub after completion. Players can stay with each other throughout the entire journey if they wish. Doing so requires entering between level loads with that partner.</p><p style="">During the journey, the player will usually be unaware of who they are playing with. It is possible to play with friends if both enter the same area at the same time, but this involves out-of-game communication. Within the game, players only learn the PSN IDs of their companions after the credits, when the PSN IDs appear in chronological order. Players can only communicate by using the circle button to emit sounds. The longer the button is held down, the louder the note will be.</p><h2>References to Past thatgamecompany Games</h2><h4><a href="/flow/3030-15849" data-ref-id="3030-15849">flOw</a></h4><p style="">One of the cellular lifeforms from flOw can be found hidden in the temple in the sixth level.

If the player enters this circle, their robe goes from red to white. White-robed players' scarves refill with power whenever they are on the ground, making their flying ability essentially unlimited.

The focus of the game's story is the Kid's quest to create a safe haven, known as <a data-ref-id="3035-3776" href="/the-bastion/3035-3776">the Bastion</a>. The rest of the world has become a series of floating islands after the Calamity.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">Bastion is an action RPG with a level structure that emphasizes fast paced and frantic gameplay. The Kid moves through fantasy-themed environments that form up underneath his feet as he moves thorough each level. In order to progress, the Kid must defeat enemies using a variety of melee and ranged weaponry while collecting items and leveling up his attributes with experience points along the way. There is a currency in Bastion known as fragments, or pieces of the Old World. They are found laying about in the different environments and are dropped by enemies upon defeat. Between levels, the Kid visits the Bastion, where he can use the fragments he has acquired to purchase weapon upgrades and spirits. These spirits alter and enhance the Kid's abilities in a number of different ways. Depending on the level of the character, players can "equip" more spirits and therefore give themselves a greater advantage in battle.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/35/1638270-bastion_112010_0001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1638270" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/35/1638270-bastion_112010_0001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1638270"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/35/1638270-bastion_112010_0001.jpg"></a><figcaption>Fighting a Scumbag, one of the unique monsters in Bastion</figcaption></figure><p style="">The game incorporates a unique feature called 'dynamic narration'. <a data-ref-id="3005-19712" href="/rucks/3005-19712">Rucks</a>, the strange old man (voiced by <a data-ref-id="3040-99847" href="/logan-cunningham/3040-99847">Logan Cunningham</a>), serves as the game's narrator. As well as delivering story exposition, Rucks' narration will change based on the player's actions and style of play - for example, he might remark upon the player's affinity for a certain weapon if said weapon is used frequently during battle, or he might comment on an enemy that the player is about to fight.</p><p style="">Aside from the main locations that the player visits throughout the progression of the main story, there are also optional challenge levels for each weapon. Referred to as Proving Grounds, these areas test the player's ability to use each weapon efficiently. The player is also able to participate in three different arenas that provide additional lore for the game's characters while adding a competitive nature to the game through online leaderboards.</p><p style="">The Kid has access to buildings in the Bastion that can drastically alter the way game is played such as: weapon/spirit load out, weapon upgrades, and enemy difficulty.</p><h3>Buildings</h3><ul><li><b>Arsenal:</b> The Kid comes here to swap his weapons and his Secret Skill.</li><li><b>Forge:</b> The Kid can upgrade his weapons here using materials he finds or buys.</li><li><b>Lost-and-Found:</b> The general store that the Kid can buy materials, mementos, and Spirits with fragments (money).</li><li><b>Memorial:</b> A place that honors the citizens of Caelondia.

If provoked enough, those orcs may uproot their camp and move to a new location they believe will be easier to pick off wandering adventurers. Players might then do a quest that changes the patrol route of guards, which further angers an orc emperor somewhere nearby who starts sending even more orcs to fight back. Dynamic AI like this example is present throughout EQ Next, which means the world is continuously changing based on the actions of individual players as well as collective groups of players.</p><h4><strong>Permanent Change (Rallying Calls)</strong></h4><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2524532-screen+shot+2013-08-02+at+4.03.27+pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-2524532" data-ratio="0.5640625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2524532-screen+shot+2013-08-02+at+4.03.27+pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-2524532"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2524532-screen+shot+2013-08-02+at+4.03.27+pm.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2524532-screen+shot+2013-08-02+at+4.03.27+pm.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Concept art featuring potential scenarios during the building of a city.</figcaption></figure><p style="">Server-wide <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/public-quests/3015-1667" data-ref-id="3015-1667">Public Quests</a> that can take months of real time to complete and have a permanent impact on that server's version of <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/norrath/3035-231" data-ref-id="3035-231">Norrath</a>. These Rallying Calls have various story beat checkpoints, but it is not always clear what exactly will trigger the next piece. For example, a city is being built somewhere in the wilderness. Players can help or impede the progress of the city's construction by building walls, clearing nearby forests of goblins, or protecting miners from the dangers found below the city. Through the progression of the story, new quests will be introduced based on what players have done on that server's version of the Rallying Call. Once complete, a permanent change will have been made in that server's world, which may be completely different from what another server's community did. These Rallying Calls could include events such as constructions of city, multistage wars between factions, invasions of new races, and much more.</p><h2>Class System</h2><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2524515-screen+shot+2013-08-02+at+3.44.42+pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-2524515" data-ratio="0.5609375" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2524515-screen+shot+2013-08-02+at+3.44.42+pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-2524515"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2524515-screen+shot+2013-08-02+at+3.44.42+pm.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2524515-screen+shot+2013-08-02+at+3.44.42+pm.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>Human Wizard &amp; Kerran Warrior</figcaption></figure><p style="">EverQuest Next utilizes a <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/multiclass/3015-2645" data-ref-id="3015-2645">multiclass</a> system that allows players to pick and choose aspects of many familiar and not-so-familiar classes to create their own unique characters.

They can switch between their available classes at any time except while in combat. While there are no artificial limitations on how many classes one player can discover, there may be faction-based limitations. For example, a <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/guild/3015-1166" data-ref-id="3015-1166">guild</a> of <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/assassin/3015-1321" data-ref-id="3015-1321">assassins</a> may require a player to perform certain tasks in order to earn their trust and join their ranks.

If a player wants to be a teleporting <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/rogues/3015-1460" data-ref-id="3015-1460">rogue</a>, they can do that. While many of the class types are traditional in terms of the MMO genre, the "holy trinity" of Tank/Healer/DPS has been mostly scrapped.

While similar in many ways to the fiction found in the previous games of the franchise, the lore in EverQuest Next has been completely reimagined. The history is divided up into four main eras, which are each divided into various ages.</p><h3>Keldarain Era</h3><ul><li>Age of Awakening</li><li>Age of Balance</li><li>Age of Exploration</li><li>Age of Decline</li></ul><h3>Lost Era</h3><ul><li>Age of Ruin</li><li>Age of Strife</li></ul><h3>Dal Era</h3><p style="">"Dal" is the elvish word for <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/elf/3015-537" data-ref-id="3015-537">elf</a>. The Dal Era encompasses a period of 2000 years of dominance of the elven races of <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/norrath/3035-231" data-ref-id="3035-231">Norrath</a>.</p><h4>Age of Ascension</h4><p style="">Elves, who had previously lived in small villages in the <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/forest/3035-1889" data-ref-id="3035-1889">forests</a>, begin to build large cities and become the most advanced race in the world.</p><h4>Age of Allies</h4><p style="">Elves discover the use of <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/teleportation/3015-8" data-ref-id="3015-8">teleportation</a> through the massive spires found throughout the world. As a result of this, the elves begin forming alliances with other races including the <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/dragons/3015-551" data-ref-id="3015-551">dragons</a>. The age is considered a "golden age" to historians as it was time of peace and sharing of cultures. The <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/shissar/3015-5426" data-ref-id="3015-5426">Shissar</a>, a race of snake-like people, betrayed the elves and other races by starting a war in an attempt to claim all of <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/norrath/3035-231" data-ref-id="3035-231">Norrath</a> for themselves. The shissar were eventually defeated by a coalition of other races and the teleportation spires to shissar empire were sealed.</p><h4>Takish Age</h4><p style="">The elves become paranoid that other races will turn on them as the shissar did. The strength of the alliances begin to decay and a sect of elves begin to separate themselves from the rest of their own race. Calling themselves The <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/high-elves/3015-3914" data-ref-id="3015-3914">Koada'Dal</a> ("high elves" in the common tongue), these elves considered themselves the best their society had to offer. Their discovery of High Magic, a <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/magic/3015-98" data-ref-id="3015-98">magic</a> that rivaled that of even the dragons, allowed them to hold power over the other races, which led to the creation of Takish Empire and the capital city, Takish'Hiz. The dragons then left these lands and went back into isolation on the continent of <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/velious/3035-3183" data-ref-id="3035-3183">Velious</a>.</p><p style="">The Takish Empire ruled for a few hundred years, but that all changed with The Sundering. The spire closest to Takish'Hiz exploded in an eruption of fire and stone, which buried the capital under a towering mountain of rubble, now known as <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/ashfang/3035-4422" data-ref-id="3035-4422">Ashfang</a>. The capital of the empire was gone and the secrets of High Magic were lost as well. In the aftermath, the various kingdoms of elves began warring with each other for control. Peace was eventually established but the elven empire would never come close to the power they had before.</p><p style="">The dragons saw the fall of Takish'Hiz and the loss of High Magic as their opportunity to once again become the dominant race in the world. The Dragon War began with the utter destruction of elvish colonies on <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/faydwer/3035-3180" data-ref-id="3035-3180">Faydwer</a>. While the Koada'Dal were elvish purists, another faction of elves, known as the <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/wood-elves/3015-3915" data-ref-id="3015-3915">Feir'Dal</a> ("wood elves" in the common tongue), were more open about collaborating with other races. The wood elves joined forces with many of the other races in the Norrath (<a href="//www.giantbomb.com/human/3015-810" data-ref-id="3015-810">humans</a>, <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/ogres/3015-1426" data-ref-id="3015-1426">ogres</a>, <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/kerrans/3015-5455" data-ref-id="3015-5455">kerrans</a>, <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/dwarves/3015-940" data-ref-id="3015-940">dwarves</a>, etc.) to combat the rising force of the dragons. The dragons were too strong though, and soon this new combined force of races realized they could no longer survive in their homelands, so they decided to flee to <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/kunark/3035-3181" data-ref-id="3035-3181">Kunark</a>. In order to buy time for this, an elite force of soldiers known as the <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/dark-elves/3015-2088" data-ref-id="3015-2088">Teir'Dal</a> ("dark elves" in the common tongue) held a last line of defense at a fortress known as Bastion while the rest successfully escaped through the spires.</p><h3>Combine Era</h3><p style="">Driven from the lands they had known for thousands of years, the races of Norrath must start from scratch in the unexplored wilds of Kunark and work together to survive.</p><h4>Age of Exile</h4><p style="">Although the losses were extremely high, the plan at Bastion was a success and many made it Kunark alive. The Combine quickly began establishing camps and exploring the mysterious continent. It was not long before they discovered that Kunark was now controlled by the <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/shissar/3015-5426" data-ref-id="3015-5426">shissar</a> that had betrayed them so many years ago. With revenge on their minds, the shissar had spent the last few hundred years building an <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/slavery/3015-1779" data-ref-id="3015-1779">enslaved</a> army of <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/iksar/3015-3916" data-ref-id="3015-3916">Iksar</a>, and now their enemies were coming to them on a silver platter. The Combine, weakened by the war with the dragons, were quickly defeated and spent 500 years enslaved by the shissar.</p><p style="">Eventually, the iksar begin an uprising against their masters, and the Combine join these efforts. The shissar defeated and driven out of Kunark to unknown whereabouts. In the aftermath, the Combine and the iksar begin establishing their own empires separately on the continent. The iksar slowly begin adopting the practices of their former masters while the Combine seek to build forces strong enough to take back their homelands.</p><h4>Age of Heroes</h4><p style="">The Combine Empire finally decides the time is right to attempt to leave Kunark and reclaim their forefather's lands. After many centuries away, the Combine established a foothold on the west coast and founded the city of <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/qeynos/3035-397" data-ref-id="3035-397">Qeynos</a>.</p><p style="">This is where players enter the timeline of Norrath in EverQuest Next.</p><h2>Development</h2><p style="">EverQuest Next has been in development for several years.

This idea was shelved when Atari sold Cryptic Studios to <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/perfect-world-entertainment/3010-6612">Perfect World Entertainment</a> in May, 2011. The game was shown at <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/e3-2011/3015-6449">E3 2011</a>, but shortly thereafter began its transformation from coop RPG to free-to-play MMO. It was delayed multiple times by Perfect World, ultimately pushing it into mid-2013.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Beta</h3><p dir="ltr" style="">Neverwinter held several closed beta weekends beginning in February 2013. Players were phased in based on their level of purchase (into founders packs), other Perfect World games they own, and PAX attendance keys. The open beta began Apr. 30, 2013. As of the open beta, player accounts will not be wiped and the game is essentially released.</p><h2 dir="ltr">System Requirements</h2><h4 dir="ltr">Minimum:</h4><ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" style="">OS: Windows XP SP3, Vista, 7 or 8</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" style="">CPU: Dual-core 2.0GHz CPU</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" style="">RAM: 1GB</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" style="">GPU: 128MB, GeForce 6800 or ATI Radeon X850 or higher, Shader Model 2.0</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" style="">Sound: DirectX 9.0c compatible sound chip or onboard audio</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" style="">Internet: Broadband Internet Connection Required</p></li></ul><h4 dir="ltr">Recommended:</h4><ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" style="">OS: Windows XP SP3, Vista, 7 or 8</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" style="">CPU: Intel Core 2 Duo 2.8GHz</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" style="">RAM: 2GB</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" style="">GPU: 512MB, GeForce 8800 or ATI Radeon HD 2900GT, Shader Model 2.0</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" style="">Sound: DirectX 9.0c compatible sound chip or onboard audio</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" style="">Internet: Broadband Internet Connection Required</p></li></ul>]]></description><expected_release_day/><expected_release_month/><expected_release_quarter/><expected_release_year/><id>32417</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/9/97089/2502904-untitled.png]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/97089/2502904-untitled.png]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/9/97089/2502904-untitled.png]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/9/97089/2502904-untitled.png]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/9/97089/2502904-untitled.png]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/97089/2502904-untitled.png]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/9/97089/2502904-untitled.png]]></tiny_url></image><name><![CDATA[Neverwinter]]></name><number_of_user_reviews>-3</number_of_user_reviews><original_game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-1/]]></api_detail_url><id>1</id><name><![CDATA[ESRB: T]]></name></game_rating><game_rating><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-2/]]></api_detail_url><id>2</id><name><![CDATA[PEGI: 16+]]></name></game_rating></original_game_rating><original_release_date>2013-06-20 00:00:00</original_release_date><platforms><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/]]></api_detail_url><id>94</id><name><![CDATA[PC]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PC]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-145/]]></api_detail_url><id>145</id><name><![CDATA[Xbox One]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-one/3045-145/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[XONE]]></abbreviation></platform><platform><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/]]></api_detail_url><id>146</id><name><![CDATA[PlayStation 4]]></name><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/]]></site_detail_url><abbreviation><![CDATA[PS4]]></abbreviation></platform></platforms><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/neverwinter/3030-32417/]]></site_detail_url></game><game><aliases/><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-32560/]]></api_detail_url><date_added>2010-09-03 21:21:46</date_added><date_last_updated>2016-01-04 09:51:12</date_last_updated><deck><![CDATA[Puddle is a platform game where you move liquid from one side of a level to another.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">A physics based puzzle game in which you guide a series of liquids from one point to another in varying maps and environments.

The game went through a closed and open beta period in the early months of 2012, and released in Japan for the PC on July 4, 2012. The mobile version of the game is currently slated for a Q4 2012 release and the PS Vita version is being targeted for Japanese release in early 2013. All versions of the game will run on the same servers, allowing players to use the same characters cross-platform, though the versions set to appear on mobile phone platforms are said to be reduced versions of the game. On July 9th, 2012, SEGA announced plans to localize the game for North American and European territories. An English PC version was slated for an early 2013 release, yet as of late March 2013, Sonic Team officially delayed the release in North America. Never with a true release date, the team continues to bypass any specifics as to when the title will make its way overseas.</p><p style="">In addition to a new story, new areas, quests, and characters, PSO2 brings a host of gameplay changes. These include a revamped combat system, a new quest progression system, new control mechanics, and new character building options.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8124/2259927-pso20120708_170432_023.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2259927" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8124/2259927-pso20120708_170432_023.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2259927"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/8124/2259927-pso20120708_170432_023.jpg"></a><figcaption>Phantasy Star Online 2 in-quest combat</figcaption></figure><p style="">PSO2 is a <a href="/free-to-play/3015-1308" data-ref-id="3015-1308">free-to-play</a> game. Micro-transactions are applied to a variety of functions in the game such as new character slots or purchasing stat resets. These micro-transactions take place using a currency called Arks Cash, which can be purchased using real-world money. Arks Cash can also be spent on access to the "Premium Set," which grants access to a private room (which can be decorated), the ability to trade items, access to sell items via a searchable player-run shop system, and lobbies specifically built for use by premium members.</p><p style="">The game's successful open beta and launch, as well as excitement for a new game in the <a href="/phantasy-star/3025-454" data-ref-id="3025-454">Phantasy Star</a> series, has attracted a strong English community in the Japanese version, which attempts to congregate on Ship 02 and, more recently, Ship 10. The sudden influx of new players, a large majority being international, had forced SEGA to temporarily close down character registration on the most popular Ships from July 8th to the 18th. Character registration is now re-open on all Ships.</p><h2>Classes</h2><p style="">There are three classes to play as in PSO2: Hunter, Ranger, and Force. Players pick a class to start as but can switch to any other class at any time. Each class starts at level 1 and levels independently. When a player switches from one class to another, the previous class' progress is maintained and can be returned to at any time. The three classes have unique weapons, though all three can use the Gunslash, a melee/ranged weapon that swaps from one mode to the other on command.</p><h3>Hunter</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8124/2259911-pso20120708_170353_021.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2259911" data-size="small" style="width: 223px" data-ratio="1.4439461883408" data-width="223" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:144.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8124/2259911-pso20120708_170353_021.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2259911"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8124/2259911-pso20120708_170353_021.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8124/2259911-pso20120708_170353_021.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Xeno, a Hunter AI partner.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The Hunter class is the melee class, and they focus on up-close damage with swords and photon arts.

Players are ranked when completing a quest, with the rank being dependent on the number of enemies defeated and the goal completion. The highest rank is the almighty <a href="/s-rank/3015-2962" data-ref-id="3015-2962">S-rank</a>.</p><h3>Quest Counter</h3><p style="">Quest Counter quests can be accepted at the, quest counter. This is located on the top floor of the ship.</p><h4><a href="http://i.minus.com/i3x6pIk15wP5i.jpg" rel="nofollow">Free Exploration</a></h4><p style="">Free Exploration quests are unlocked through Koffee's client orders. These quests are only available after completing all of the Arks quests, and do not contain any in-area objectives. The goal is instead an <i>Emergency Code: Duel</i>, where players must defeat a boss in the third area. These bosses are significantly more difficult than regular or <a href="/mini-boss/3015-420" data-ref-id="3015-420">elite</a> enemies and require a bigger time investment to defeat. While Free Exploration quests do not contain objectives within the first two areas, it is possible for one or more <i>Emergency Code</i> mini-quests to appear whilst exploring.</p><h4><a href="http://i.minus.com/ibfMwzEerrKgNt.jpg" rel="nofollow">Arks Quests</a></h4><p style="">These are the default quests that can be accepted at the quest counter. They are unlocked in succession after completing the previous stage and have varying completion objectives. These objectives range from killing a certain number of enemies, completing different <i>Emergency Codes,</i> defeating a particular type of enemy. Arks Quests usually involve one or two areas.</p><h4><a href="http://i.minus.com/i5FYAYTSxdgFU.jpg" rel="nofollow">Emergency Quests</a></h4><p style="">Emergency Quests are daily events that will show up at the quest counter for a limited time during that day. Players are alerted of an Emergency Quest through a radio message <a href="http://i.minus.com/ibqRdCPaeg0U3C.jpg" rel="nofollow">(the scrolling text at the top of the screen)</a> and cannot invite AI partners into the quest. They are located in a warzone/city area, are <b>timed</b> missions, and involve three areas. Area 1 is a solo stage which may or may not involve an <i>Emergency Code</i> mini-quest. Area 2 is a public area that contains a higher enemy count and higher chance of PSE Burst, with an equal chance of one or more <i>Emergency Code</i> mini-quests. The third and final area is an <i>Emergency Code: Dual</i> with a boss, usually of significant difficulty.</p><p style=""><b><a href="http://i.imgur.com/WoSgl.jpg" rel="nofollow">Story Quests</a></b></p><p style="">These quests are unlocked through the Matter Board and progress the game's story. They can only be played in a solo party.</p><h3><a href="http://i.imgur.com/vRvXM.jpg" rel="nofollow">Client Orders</a></h3><p style="">Client Orders are character specific quests that you can accept on both floors of the ship. These characters will have objectives to give for you, some preset and some daily. Certain client orders may involve both types of quests within one.</p><h4>Goal</h4><p style="">Goal client orders are quests that need to be completed under certain conditions, usually involving S-ranking a mission under a certain amount of time. Some goal quests might also involve S-ranking a mission with <b>only</b> one specific AI partner.</p><h4>Item Collection</h4><p style="">Collection client orders are relatively self-explanatory. Kill X amount of enemies, collect Y amount of items, acquire X drop from Y enemy.</p><h3>Matter Board</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8124/2259922-pso20120708_165831_007.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2259922" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.80153846153846" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8124/2259922-pso20120708_165831_007.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2259922"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8124/2259922-pso20120708_165831_007.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8124/2259922-pso20120708_165831_007.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Matter Board and a legend to explain its symbols</figcaption></figure><p style="">The Matter Board is used to progress through the game's story. It contains multiple pages of quest orbs and completing quests on the board will unlock the connecting orbs. Each board has a set number of bright orbs and completing these orbs will unlock the next story quest. The objectives in the Matter Board can be all types of activities, with some orbs even being as simple as talking to a specific character. Most Matter Board objectives, though, are specifically focused on getting a specific type of enemy to drop a specific type of item. Unlike Client Orders and most other in-game quest systems, enemies only drop those specific items when the correct spot on the Matter Board is selected before leaving the ship and starting a mission. Once the player has started a mission, the Matter Board can not be changed.</p><p style="">Once the next story quest is unlocked and completed, a new page on the Matter Board opens up. Players may still return to the previous Matter Board to finish incomplete orbs.</p><h3>Emergency Code</h3><p style="">During certain quests, <i>Emergency Code</i> events, also known as "interrupts", may trigger. This can be at random or because of a quest objective, and they come in multiple variations:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Emergency Code Name</th><th>Timed?</th><th>Objective</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><b><i>Arrest</i></b></td><td>Yes</td><td>Capture a pre-determined amount of enemies within your immediate area before the timer runs out. This is almost always a situation where Nab Rappies <i>(The yellow bird-like enemies)</i> need to be killed, only they vanish instead of burrowing away into the ground. However, showing hostility to the targeted enemy will cause them to run and escape, and escaping enemies can hurt your final rank.</td></tr><tr><td><b><i><a href="http://i.imgur.com/8VYkS.jpg" rel="nofollow">Attack</a></i></b></td><td>No</td><td>The most common of all EC mini-quests and involves killing a preset number of enemies within your immediate area. If there are less enemies nearby than there are left to complete the EC, the game will immediately spawn more enemies. <i>EC: Attack</i> can only be failed if the player dies, as the game will usually close off the area around the player. On occasion, a rare type of <i>Attack</i> can appear where the player is pitted against a powerful enemy and a few less powerful enemies. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Hxg1x.jpg" rel="nofollow">The HUD will display the <i>Emergency Code</i> in red if this is the case</a>. The fight will, however, play out exactly like an <i>Emergency Code: Duel.</i></td></tr><tr><td><b><i>Avoid</i></b></td><td>Yes</td><td>The most difficult of all ECs. An invincible enemy spawns within the area and a timer starts. The player must avoid dying or being hit more than twice by the enemy, or else the EC is failed. It is possible to escape this <i>Emergency Code</i> by using a Telepipe and warping back into the area, as it nullifies the EC. It can also be nullified by moving on to the next area.</td></tr><tr><td><b><i>Collect</i></b></td><td>No</td><td>A giant wall preventing progression will appear at the start of this EC. Three boxes will randomly spawn in the area in succession from each other. When the player collects the third box, the player will then be asked to bring the items to the door. This will remove the wall and the EC will be complete.</td></tr><tr><td><b><i><a href="http://i.imgur.com/vfwhS.jpg" rel="nofollow">Duel</a></i></b></td><td>No</td><td>A fancy title for "boss fight". <i>EC:D</i>s will take place in a dedicated area (although they can <i>very</i> rarely show up in the wild) and will involve fighting a significantly more difficult enemy until it is defeated. Completing a Duel will cause the enemy to drop a large crystal containing multiple smaller drops.</td></tr><tr><td><b><i>Destruction</i></b></td><td>No</td><td>A large sphere appears in a random location on the map. This sphere must be destroyed to complete the Code, and its health meter is shown underneath the game's on-screen map. As it takes damage, it grows in size and begins to spawn more and more enemies to help protect the sphere. The EC is completed when the sphere is destroyed. Killing the enemies it spawns is optional.</td></tr><tr><td><b><i><a href="http://i.imgur.com/dQ1Lg.jpg" rel="nofollow">Elimination</a></i></b></td><td>Yes</td><td>Similar to <i>Attack,</i> only a time limit is added to the fight. If all enemies are not taken out at the end of the timer, the EC is failed.</td></tr><tr><td><b><i>Protection</i></b></td><td>No</td><td>The opposite of <i>Destruction</i>. A crashed ship appears in a random spot on the map and enemies swarm to attack it. The player must defend the ship from the enemies as the ship's crew repair it. The ship's repair meter is displayed underneath the map. Once fully repaired, the ship leaves and the EC is completed.</td></tr></tbody></table><p style=""><i><u>Additional note</u>: While this may not be the case with every EC, it possible for certain Emergency Codes to stack.</i> <i><b>Attack</b> and <b>Collect</b>, for example, can stack on occasion in the Caves area. There is no penalization for completing one before the other, or failing one whilst the other is active.</i></p><h2>Free-to-Play</h2><p style="">Though playing Phantasy Star Online 2 is <a href="/free-to-play/3015-1308" data-ref-id="3015-1308">free</a> for all players, there are a number of items and features that can be acquired via Arks Cash.

It explores the concept of identity; the fuzzy line between mind and body. The player controls an astronaut with a mysterious device called The Swapper which allows them to make clones and swap between them.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">The Swapper is a 2D puzzle-platformer for PC and consoles that explores the concept of identity and the line between mind and body. The player controls an astronaut with a mysterious device called the Swapper which allows them to make clones and swap between them.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">The Swapper relies on two main mechanics, cloning and swapping. The first is the ability to create up to 4 clones of your character at any one time. You create a clone by clicking and holding the left mouse button (which will then drastically slow down time) then moving your cursor to place the outline of the clone where you want it to appear, and releasing the mouse button. You do not have direct control over these clones, as they will only mimic your characters motions.</p><p style="">The clones can be used to traverse environments by using the second ability your character possesses which is to swap your character's consciousness (and therefore direct control) with one of your clones. An example would be to place a clone at the top of an inaccessible ledge and then swap to that clone, leaving behind your old body and progressing through the environment. To swap clones you only need to have a clear line-of-sight to your target. Clones will disappear when touched by the one you are in control of, and can also be killed off by being dropped by ledges. Once killed they will be added back to your available clone count. There are also reset points in the environment which will destroy all currently deployed clones.</p><p style="">The goal of each puzzle is to navigate your way to obtaining an orb, which you then have to touch with a clone you are currently in direct control of to solve the puzzle. After obtaining a certain number of orbs, you will unlock new areas of the map and while you do not need to solve all puzzles to progress, you will need to eventually solve them all to access the games ending. Later puzzles introduce new mechanics such as colored lights which blocks clone creating or clone swapping in certain areas, pressure plates to remove barriers, and gravity reversing devices.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style="">The story of The Swapper seems simple at first but then reveals surprising depth, laden with heavy and thought-provoking themes. At the beginning of the game the protagonist, a mysterious astronaut whose identity is never revealed, crash lands on some sort of abandoned mining facility in a far flung corner of space. As players explore, they begin to uncover some of the secrets this complex has to offer. Terminals placed throughout the environment will give the player clues as to the recent history of the people that inhabited the facility before it was abandoned. The deeper players get, the more apparent it becomes that things may not be quite as they seem.</p><h2>Console Versions</h2><p style="">Curve Studios enhanced the Wii U version of The Swapper with exclusive optional touch-only controls. This version also retains certain graphical effects of the PC version like the depth of field effect that is missing from the PS3 version. On PS4, the touch pad can be used to scroll around the map and the visuals are on-par with the PC original. On PS Vita, the touch screen is used for the same.</p><h2>System Requirements</h2><ul><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows XP SP3</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Dual Core CPU (2.2+ GHz Dual Core CPU

unlockable weapons. Also, crates are score.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Super Crate Box is a shooter-platformer in which the objective is to collect crates for a high score while fighting off hordes of enemies. With further progression through the game and higher scores the player can unlock new player skins, more modes of play, and more experimental weapons.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">A game of Super Crate Box starts with the player in the middle of the level with a basic pistol and a single crate spawning at a random location. Almost immediately enemies will begin to fall from a hole at the top of the level, ranging from small green skulls, large green skulls, and flying white skulls, in varying patterns of waves.</p><p style="">Unlike most video games of the ilk, defeating enemies doesn't gain the player any points instead the only way to earn points (and progress to harder levels)  is to collect crates  without colliding with an enemy, which instantly kills the player. Each crate contains a different weapon which the player's character will automatically switch to. This presents a dilemma as some weapons are better at certain situations than others but in order to keep it the player must forgo earning points and thus progressing. To further complicate this task, a pit is placed at the bottom of the level which kills the player if they fall in, but upgrades enemies to a much quicker,dangerous state if they progress to the pit. They will then respawn at the top of the screen to repeat the path to the bottom, while new enemies continue to spawn. In order to maintain a high score the player must balance out the tasks of collecting crates with using the weapons found in the crates to keep enemy numbers to a minimum.</p><h3>Gameplay Modes</h3><ul><li><b>Normal</b> - The enemies spawn at the top of the stage at an average spawn rate.</li><li><b>SFMT</b> - The enemies spawn at the top of the stage at a quicker spawn rate.</li><li><b>Ambush</b> - The enemies spawn in random locations at an average spawn rate.</li></ul><h2>Weapons</h2><p style="">After subsequent playthroughs, the player will unlock certain milestones based off of high scores as well as total crates accumulated of the course of play time. These milestones will make available new weapons, characters, and unlock new levels and difficulties.

He's having a bad week.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The player is cast as <a href="/james-heller/3005-17325" data-ref-id="3005-17325">James Heller</a>, a soldier whose family was killed in the viral mayhem unleashed upon <a href="/manhattan/3035-1613" data-ref-id="3035-1613">Manhattan</a> by former protagonist <a href="/alex-mercer/3005-3056" data-ref-id="3005-3056">Alex Mercer</a> while Heller was serving overseas. He returns to <a href="/new-york-city/3035-109" data-ref-id="3035-109">New York</a> 14 months after the original outbreak as part of a clean-up effort, intending to die fighting the viral outbreak and be with his family. Instead, their paths cross and Mercer personally infects Heller with the <a href="/blacklight-virus/3015-2368" data-ref-id="3015-2368">Blacklight Virus</a>. Thereafter, Heller dedicates himself to hunting and killing Mercer, no matter the cost.</p><p style="">Since the Manhattan outbreak of the <a href="/blacklight-virus/3015-2368" data-ref-id="3015-2368">Blacklight</a> virus, New York (NY Zero, as it is now referred to) has been split into three different sections based on that area's level of affliction. The corporation responsible for the virus’s creation, <a href="/blackwatch/3015-2367" data-ref-id="3015-2367">Blackwatch</a>, has covered up its malicious acts by placing blame on Mercer. His actions from the first game, typically based on saving the lives of innocents, are twisted to look like sinister acts.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">Heller's main abilities are shapeshifting and absorption. He can consume other humans, taking in their physical appearance and memories. However, there are instances when Heller takes attributes from certain infected test subjects, such as claws and tentacles, adding to his offensive arsenal.</p><p style="">Prototype 2 is an open world sand box game built for easy navigation. James can easily run on walls, enabling him to climb buildings with little trouble. In the air, he can glide and mid-air dash in order to keep himself airbourne.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2130592-prototype22.16.121.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2130592" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2130592-prototype22.16.121.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2130592"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/135472/2130592-prototype22.16.121.jpg"></a><figcaption>James gliding in the air.</figcaption></figure><p style="">In battle, Heller can use dodge moves to evade opponents. Offensively, he can use his bare fists for either quick combos or heavy attacks. When his health bar is low, he can grab any human character and consume them, taking on their likeness, and absorbing bit of health. Each biological weapon has its own special attack (ie. "Pounce" for the claws and "Black Hole" for the tentacles). There are also weapons lying around, like guns and bazookas, that Heller can use to his advantage. James can also hijack military vehicles (ie. helicopters) for his own uses.</p><p style="">As there are many military officers around, Heller needs to keep a low profile. Once spotted, however, he will be fired upon until he can escape. To get the jackboots off his back Heller needs to break line of sight in order to completely empty a circular bar that represents the police's willingness to pursue him. Disguises are often Heller's best friend.</p><p style="">Every so often, James levels up and can improve important aspects of himself such as health and speed. There are further upgrades depending on Heller's actions (offensive, defensive etc).</p><p style="">There are hidden items to find in each sector of the world (like black boxes) that can further improve Heller's attributes and even provide backstory.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2130594-prototype22.16.123.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2130594" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2130594-prototype22.16.123.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2130594"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2130594-prototype22.16.123.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2130594-prototype22.16.123.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>James lifting up an enemy.</figcaption></figure><p style="">James Heller is a former mildly-decorated soldier from the war in Iraq. Despite issues with post traumatic stress and an insatiable will to kill Alex Mercer (the person he blames for killing his wife and daughter), he is assigned to Blackwatch, a military organization, in the red zone of the infected New York City (now known as New York Zero). Heller and company were attacked by Mercer, and despite frequent attempts to slay the man, Heller fails in his revenge quest and is subsequently infected by the Mercer Virus by Mercer himself.</p><p style="">Heller next finds himself taken back by Blackwatch in order to be experimented upon. However, despite showing fighting skills, the testers are wary of another experiment gone wrong and decide to kill Heller. Heller escapes but is confronted by Mercer, who asserts that he didn't kill James' wife and daughter and that Gentek and Blackwatch are working together to conduct a biological weapon experiment within NYZ.</p><p style="">First, Heller goes to Father Guerra for spiritual guidance, but Guerra explains that no one messes with Blackwatch. Heller himself then goes out to not only decapitate some commanders, but also to stop Blackwatch from using their infected test subjects on the local population, convincing Guerra to work with him. Heller then proceeds to kill and consume the memories of more and more Blackwatch and Gentek personnel to understand and stop the nature of Gentek's plans. He is also trying to kill Colonel Rook, who ordered Heller's execution once infected with the Mercer Virus.

It was re-released in 2014 on these platforms, rebranded "Skullgirls Encore".</p><h2>Story</h2><p style="">Set in a 1940's dark <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Deco" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">Art Deco</a> world (the <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/canopy-kingdom/3035-4340" data-ref-id="3035-4340">Canopy Kingdom</a>), the story revolves around a mysterious artifact called the Skull Heart, which grants a single <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/wish/3015-2315" data-ref-id="3015-2315">wish</a> to a young woman every seven years. However, women who attempt to use it with an impure heart become corrupted into a monstrous being of immense power (known as the "Skullgirl") and unleash chaos upon the world. Female fighters from all over the Kingdom seek to claim the artifact for themselves (for various different purposes), having to stop the current wielder, the Skullgirl <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/bloody-marie/3005-23312" data-ref-id="3005-23312">Bloody Marie</a>, in the process.</p><h2>History</h2><p style="">Skullgirls began its life as two separate “doujin” projects. <a href="/tournament/3015-1096" data-ref-id="3015-1096">Tournament</a> fighter <a href="/mike-zaimont/3040-101660" data-ref-id="3040-101660">Mike “Mike Z” Zaimont</a> had begun working on a fighting game engine, while <a href="/alex-ahad/3040-103997" data-ref-id="3040-103997">Alex “o_8” Ahad</a> had begun working on a world, story and characters for a fighting game. Some years later, mutual friends introduced them to one another, and their two personal projects were merged into the game we see today. <a href="/richard-wyckoff/3040-13699" data-ref-id="3040-13699">Richard Wyckoff</a> and <a href="/emil-dotchevski/3040-7405" data-ref-id="3040-7405">Emil Dotchevski</a> began <a href="/reverge-labs-llc/3010-7447" data-ref-id="3010-7447">Reverge Labs</a> in 2010 after <a href="/pandemic-studios/3010-1779" data-ref-id="3010-1779">Pandemic Studios</a> was shut down. Mike Z teamed up with Wyckoff, also a former Pandemic employee, and Reverge Labs to bring Skullgirls to home consoles.</p><p style="">In May of 2012 Autumn Games, the publisher for Skullgirls, became embroiled in a lawsuit alongside Konami filed against them by City National Bank over allegations of fraud. With their assets frozen by the courts, <a href="/autumn-games/3010-7446" data-ref-id="3010-7446">Autumn Games</a> was unable to give Reverge Labs their share of the profits from sales of their game. Suddenly without income, the developer went through a series of layoffs before eventually dissolving, with the core team reforming under the newly branded <a href="/lab-zero-games/3010-8407" data-ref-id="3010-8407">Lab Zero Games</a> in November of 2012.</p><p style="">While the future of Skullgirls was uncertain, Mike Z and co. were bolstered by the continued support of their fans who helped them raise $78,000 in donations for breast cancer research in their bid for a spot at the <a href="/evo-championship-series/3015-7054" data-ref-id="3015-7054">EVO</a> 2013 fighting game tournament.</p><p style="">On February 25th, 2013, an Indiegogo campaign for $150,000 was launched to fund development of their first DLC character, <a href="/squigly/3005-25539" data-ref-id="3005-25539">Squigly</a>. Funding surpassed the initial goal almost immediately. Through stretch goals, four additional DLC characters were funded, as was the donation of the Z Engine powering the game to fellow independent fighting game developer Mane 6. In total the campaign raised $829,829.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">Skullgirls is designed as a competitive fighting game, taking inspiration from other games in the genre while implementing several unique systems of its own.</p><h3>Infinite Detection</h3><p style="">Central to Skullgirls’ design is a unique infinite detection system, designed to make the game somewhat “self-balancing.” If the game detects that a player is looping a <a href="../../combo/92-18/" rel="nofollow">combo</a>, the hit-sparks will change color and the opponent can break out of it with a single button press. However, as long as the player is changing up their combo and improvising, the combo can continue.</p><h3>“Ratio System” Tag Battles</h3><p style="">At the start of battle, each player can pick one super-powerful character, two stronger characters or three normal characters - team sizes don't need to match. Single characters do more damage and have more <a href="../../health/92-130/" rel="nofollow">HP</a>, but lose the strategic advantages of character assists and the ability to regenerate health while off-screen.</p><h3>Custom Assists</h3><p style="">While each character comes with a few preset assists, Skullgirls also offers support for custom assists, allowing you to choose an assist move by inputting its motion during character selection. Aside from <a href="../../super-combo/92-6149/" rel="nofollow">super moves</a>, any ground action can be chosen - this includes throws, normal attacks, dashes, and any special move.</p><h3>Building Super Meter</h3><p style="">Players can build their <a href="../../super-meter/92-1013/" rel="nofollow">super meter</a> by whiffing normal attacks (attacking without hitting the opponent), but only if they stay in place or are moving forward - moving backwards and attacking will not build meter. Additionally, only one level can be built this way - if the player already has a super stocked, normal attacks must make contact with an opponent to build any more meter.</p><h3>High/Low Unblockables</h3><p style="">High/low unblockables exist in many fighting games, and are an extremely strong tactic when discovered. In Skullgirls, however, after a character blocks a high or low hit, they are protected for a period of time from being hit by the other type. The protection is short enough to not affect regular gameplay, but long enough that a player can successfully defend against the first attack and still be protected from what might otherwise be an unblockable second attack.</p><h2><b>Characters</b></h2><p style="">The eight launch characters are: <a href="/filia/3005-18187" data-ref-id="3005-18187">Filia</a>, <a href="/cerebella/3005-18186" data-ref-id="3005-18186">Cerebella</a>, <a href="/peacock/3005-18191" data-ref-id="3005-18191">Peacock</a>, <a href="/parasoul/3005-20764" data-ref-id="3005-20764">Parasoul</a>, <a href="/ms-fortune/3005-20721" data-ref-id="3005-20721">Ms. Fortune</a>, <a href="/painwheel/3005-21354" data-ref-id="3005-21354">Painwheel</a>, <a href="/valentine/3005-21355" data-ref-id="3005-21355">Valentine</a> and <a href="/double/3005-22367" data-ref-id="3005-22367">Double</a>.

In their place was a powerful parasite named Samson, grafted to her head in the form of unruly hair - with eyes and teeth, no less. Unable to remember how her partnership with Samson began, Filia must trust the ancient being and wield his strength if she ever hopes to piece together her past... and survive the inevitable confrontation with the Skullgirl.</p><p style="">Filia is a "rushdown" character. As such, she has only three special moves and makes up with it with lots of maneuverability and easily-comboed normal attacks.</p><h3><a href="/cerebella/3005-18186" data-ref-id="3005-18186">Cerebella</a></h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/107492/2083187-cerebella.png" data-ref-id="1300-2083187" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="1.5126050420168" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:151.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/107492/2083187-cerebella.png" data-ref-id="1300-2083187"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/10/107492/2083187-cerebella.png"></a></figure><p style="">Cerebella is the biggest sensation in the Cirque des Cartes - a tumbling, soaring dynamo of star power! Throughout the kingdom, Cerebella is admired for her daring, and lusted after for her curvaceous form. Sadly, the kind of approval she craves is the one kind she isn't getting: what Cerebella really longs for is praise from her patron and de facto father, mobster Vitale Medici, who rescued her from the street for a life of fame.</p><p style="">Faced with Cerebella's inherent goodness, the only way Vitale can keep her doing such dirty work is withhold affection. Cerebella is the only person capable of controlling the living weapon Vice-Versa, so the cold and calculating Vitale must keep her wrapped around his little finger.</p><p style="">Cerebella is a grappler with command throws for virtually any situation. Unlike typical grappler characters, she doesn't have difficulty getting in close, either, thanks to an armored charge and aerial glide.</p><h3><a href="/peacock/3005-18191" data-ref-id="3005-18191">Peacock</a></h3><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/107492/2083188-peacock.png" data-ref-id="1300-2083188" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="1.1185682326622" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:111.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/107492/2083188-peacock.png" data-ref-id="1300-2083188"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/10/107492/2083188-peacock.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/10/107492/2083188-peacock.png"></noscript></a></figure><p style="">The magnum opus of the Anti-Skullgirl Labs, Peacock is a mechanical monstrosity built from a broken little girl.</p><p style="">When she was rescued by the Labs’ Dr. Avian, she was just the orphan Patricia, her mind and body broken by the slave traders that captured her in the aftermath of the Grand War. Taking pity on her, Dr. Avian rebuilt the child with an arsenal of reality-defying weaponry, which was promptly twisted by the memories of the cartoons Patricia used to escape the pain of her slave life. Perhaps irretrievably damaged, she behaves like a rotten, spoiled and extremely unstable child. Terrifying as she may be, Peacock may very well be the best chance the Labs have to destroy the Skullgirl.</p><p style="">Peacock is a "zoning" character, and plays a mean game of keep-away with a variety of projectile attacks and escape moves.

With her friends in the Fishbone Gang, she was hired to steal the Life Gem from the head of the Medici Mafia, which she swallowed it for safe-keeping. When the Mafia caught her and the rest of her gang, they murdered them, chopped them to pieces and threw them to the bottom of the ocean. The power of the Life Gem suffused Ms. Fortunes body, and she alone survived the ordeal, but her body still bears the scars of her murder - as a result, she can detach her head and stretch her body along those scars.</p><p style="">Ms. Fortune is a hybrid "rushdown" and "puppet" character.

They are illuminated by dynamic rim lights and per-pixel lighting generated by light sources in the environment and hit sparks.</p><p style="">The backgrounds are 3D, although use minimal geometry and high-resolution textures to retain a painterly look.</p><h3>Animation</h3><p style="">Averaging around 1400 frames of animation per character, Skullgirls features the most frames of animation per character of any 2D fighting game. Additionally, the sprites are of very high resolution - they're twice the size they are on the screen for filtering and zoom-in purposes.</p><h3>GGPO Netcode</h3><p style="">Skullgirls' online experience is built upon the Good Game, Peace Out (<a href="/ggpo/3015-7124" data-ref-id="3015-7124">GGPO</a>) networking library, a favorite of the hardcore fighting game community.</p><h3>Easier Inputs</h3><p style="">In order to shift the game’s focus from executing difficult moves to fighting strategically, the game features simplified inputs.</p><p style="">For example, if a character has any 360 moves, the game will be able to tell if the player completes a 360 even if the player didn’t execute it at speeds that would be required in another fighting game. Not only does this make execution of these moves and make <a href="../../grappler/92-456/" rel="nofollow">grappler</a> characters easier, it also prevents the character from hopping (which occurs whenever the 'up' direction is pressed) at the apex of the 360 movement.</p><h3>Soundtrack</h3><p style="">Reverge Labs announced that Skullgirls' soundtrack will be composed by <a href="../../michiru-yamane/72-40896/" rel="nofollow">Michiru Yamane</a>, a composer on numerous <a href="../../castlevania/62-86/" rel="nofollow"><i>Castlevania</i></a> games.</p><h2>PC System
