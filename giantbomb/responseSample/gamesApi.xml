      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview<br /></h2>Take control of Jack and collect all the bombs in order to move to the next round.  This is not as easy as it sounds with numerous enemies such as birds, turtles and mummies getting in the way. <br /><br />Backgrounds for the Levels consist of real locations like; Miami Beach, the Sphynx or Sastle Neuschwanstein.  <br /> <br />It has 99 levels but once you hit 99 the game jumps back to round 0. The individual levels do actually repeat themselves much earlier.]]></description>

      <deck><![CDATA[Now is your chance to set off fireworks without blowing off one of your limbs!]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p>Fantavision is a PS2 game where the object of the game is to make fireworks. During gameplay various colors scroll alongside the screen. Your objective is to connect three colors together and detonate them. Chains however can be longer than three colors, and there are various power-ups that you can chain together to make multicolored combos. There is a meter on the screen, and if it runs out, (by missing too many colors) it's game over. Unlike most puzzlers, Fantavision is actually a level based game. There is no endless mode at all to speak of. At the end of each level, players can save their firework display and replay it from a variety of different camera angles and through various filters. Also just to be weird there are 1960's styled retro-future, live action vignettes that appeear between levels,</p>]]></description>

      <deck><![CDATA[A fast-paced puzzle-platformer that debuted in arcades, and later moved to home gaming systems; including the Commodore 64, NES, and Nintendo's Virtual Console.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p>In Solomon's Key, the wizard Dana adventures through 48 action-puzzle levels (and 15 "secret" levels), searching for items and avoiding danger. Dana uses his magic wand to strategically create or destroy stone blocks, in search of each level's key and exit door. Various monsters block Dana's progress, which he can avoid, trap with blocks, or fight with fire spells.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The level design becomes increasingly devious as it progresses and often makes it possible for the player to trap themselves, making it impossible to finish the level. Other levels require precise timing to reach the key and the level's door, while enemies become more frequent and aggressive. Players start with three lives, but can continue by holding UP and pressing A + B from the "Game Deviation Value" screen. Once players move beyond level 40, continues return them there. Finishing the game means completing levels 40 through 50 with only 3 lives, a very challenging feat.</p><h2>Abilities</h2><figure style="width: 320px" data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5168/274018-large2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-274018" data-size="large" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5168/274018-large2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-274018"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/5168/274018-large2.jpg" alt="A typical Solomon's Key level."></a><figcaption>A typical Solomon's Key level.</figcaption></figure><p>Players can do three things to help Dana move through each level, search for the key, and avoid danger.</p><ul><li>Create and destroy orange blocks in adjacent spaces, including blocks diagonally above or below.</li><li>Break overhead blocks by jumping into them twice with his head.</li><li>Shoot fireballs at enemies after retrieving red potions that are scattered throughout the levels.</li></ul><p>While movement seems simple at first, the game makes use of its limited mechanics to create ever more difficult puzzles that call for precise jumping and block creation. Players who can place blocks in mid-jump (creating a block below Dana while in mid-air) will find the game's hardest puzzles more navigable.</p><h2>Hidden Items and Game Endings</h2><p>Game levels organize around the Zodiac's 12 houses, with 4 rooms per sign. Level 1 to 4 is Aries, 5 to 8 is Taurus, and so on, through Pisces at 45-48. When players pick up the constellation tile in the last room of each group (level 4, 8, 12, etc.), they enter hidden levels that contain spells and special items. While Solomon's Key ends after level 48 (or the Fairy room, details below), players can earn better endings by collecting Seals of Solomon and these special items.</p><ul><li>Worst ending: failed to collect Seals of Solomon.</li><li>Better ending: collect five Seals (rooms 9, 13, 17, 21, 29), Page of Time (hidden room after 20), and Page of Space (hidden room after 44)</li><li>Best ending: collect seven Seals (rooms 9, 13, 17, 21, 29, 46, 47), Page of Time, Page of Space, and save Fairy Princess (hidden room after 48)</li></ul>]]></description>

      <deck><![CDATA[The third game in the Metal Slug series, first released to arcades in 2000 and later ported to many home consoles, PCs, and mobile devices.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p>Metal Slug 3 is a <a href="/2d/3015-1427/" data-ref-id="3015-1427">2D</a> <a href="/side-scrolling/3015-299/" data-ref-id="3015-299">side-scrolling</a> shooter that was originally released for <a href="/neo-geo/3045-25/" data-ref-id="3045-25">Neo Geo</a> MVS arcade units, but has been ported to the Neo Geo AES home console, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Xbox, <a href="/xbox-360-games-store/3045-86/" data-ref-id="3045-86">Xbox 360 Games Store</a>,  iPhone, iPad and <a href="/android/3045-123/" data-ref-id="3045-123">Android</a>. It was also a part of the <a href="/metal-slug-anthology/3030-19020/" data-ref-id="3030-19020">Metal Slug Anthology</a> collection.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Metal Slug 3's gameplay mechanics are essentially the same as previous Metal Slug games; however, the game contains many new gameplay features such as the branching path system. In many missions, the player can choose to take alternate paths to complete the level, although all paths lead to the same boss battle.</p><h2>Vehicles</h2><p>Metal Slug 3 also contains many vehicles that have not appeared in previous previous Metal Slug games, although there are no new weapons. These vehicles, in order of appearance, are:</p><ul><li><b>The Slug Mariner</b>, a submarine that fires bombs and torpedoes.</li><li><b>The Elephant Slug</b>, a huge mechanized elephant equipped with a mini-gun.</li><li><b>The Ostrich Slug</b>, which is noted for it's speed and jumping abilities.</li><li><b>The Rebel Armor</b>, a vehicle produced by Rebel and equipped with a heavy machine gun, grenade launchers, and a melee attack.</li><li><b>The Astro Slug</b>, a space vehicle which can be used by the player near the end of the game. It is capable of firing rockets.</li></ul><h2>Missions</h2><h3>Mission 1</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6844/887445-metal_slug_3_other_boss.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-887445" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6844/887445-metal_slug_3_other_boss.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-887445"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6844/887445-metal_slug_3_other_boss.jpg" alt="Marco, relaxing at home."></a><figcaption>Marco, relaxing at home.</figcaption></figure><p>The first mission puts you on an island, where crabs reign supreme. Shoot through them, as well as soldiers and giant bugs to get to the boss: a <a href="/giant-enemy-crab/3015-747/" data-ref-id="3015-747">giant crab</a>.</p><h3>Mission 2</h3><p>You arrive in a dark forest. What's there? Zombies, of course. Getting hit with the zombies' projectile bile turns you into a zombie, leaving you invincible against normal bullets, but another zombie hit means death. The boss of this place is a group of floating aliens and their glowy ship thing, once they're taken out.</p><h3>Mission 3</h3><p>While the first half of this mission is underwater, the other half- you know- isn't. Blow up submarines and SCUBA divers throughout the first half, and soldiers throughout the second. The boss here is a big ol' robot with laser eyes and a chest full of missiles.</p><h3>Mission 4</h3><p>Immediately after arriving in this desert, you are given a camel to ride. Appreciate him. Fight through waves of soldiers, helicopters and metal slugs for a while, then man-eating plants or mummies- depending on the path you choose. The boss here is... Well, I'm not sure. A floating alien-robot head? He has a beam that will turn you into gold, so try to avoid that.</p><h3>Final Mission</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/920571-xdk006_image24.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-920571" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/920571-xdk006_image24.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-920571"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/920571-xdk006_image24.jpg" alt="920571-xdk006_image24.jpg"></a></figure><p>The first part of this mission is played as a horizontal shooter in the style of <a href="/gradius/3030-15508/" data-ref-id="3030-15508"><i>Gradius</i></a>, which culminates in a boss fight against <a href="/allen-oneil/3005-15040/" data-ref-id="3005-15040">Allen O'Neil</a>. After defeating an alien impersonating <a href="/general-morden/3005-279/" data-ref-id="3005-279">General Morden</a> in a fight reminiscent of the original <a href="/metal-slug/3030-847/" data-ref-id="3030-847"><i>Metal Slug</i></a>'s final boss fight, your character is captured and beamed aboard a ship. You assume control of another character for a vertical shooter sequence chasing them. Inside the alien ship, you will rescue the real Morden, who is found in a torture device, stripped to his underwear. After teaming up with O'Neil against alien clones of your previous character, you save your partner, destroy the ship and escape out the airlock, fighting the final boss while falling back to earth.</p><h2>Extra Modes</h2><p>On the console versions, there are two more modes unlocked after beating the game.</p><h3>Fat Island</h3><ul><li>An eating competition between two players. Whoever gets the fattest wins, while not eating eventually turns the character into a <a href="/mummy/3015-1736/" data-ref-id="3015-1736">mummy</a>.</li></ul><h3>Storming the UFO Mothership</h3><ul><li>Play as one of General Morden's soldiers and kill some aliens.</li></ul>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p>Terra Cresta is a vertical scrolling shoot-em-up from Nihon Bussan (a.k.a. Nichibutsu) and is one of their earliest games. Originating in the Arcades, it would eventually make its way to a number of other 8-bit home systems. It later saw sequels and was one of the games chosen for <a href="/hamster-corporation/3010-4703/" data-ref-id="3010-4703">HAMSTER</a>'s <a href="/arcade-archives/3025-3081/" data-ref-id="3025-3081">Arcade Archives</a> series. It is the spiritual successor to 1980's <a href="/moon-cresta/3030-7451/" data-ref-id="3030-7451">Moon Cresta</a>.</p><p>While a fairly straightforward example of the genre at the time, it featured a few interesting design choices. The chief of which was the ability for the player's ship to enhance its firepower by collecting weapon pods: Doing this would also change the appearance of the ship, making it larger and appear more elaborate. Should the player collect the fifth and final weapon pod, the ship temporarily transforms into a fiery <a href="/phoenix/3015-730/" data-ref-id="3015-730">phoenix</a> that is utterly invulnerable for a brief spell. Should the player get hit at any other time, they either lose the last upgrade they found or are destroyed entirely if their ship is in its least powered-up state.</p>]]></description>

Killing enemies is in fact incentivised--in stark contrast to the series's original philosophy--as they will continually drop ammunition and gold - to which can be used to upgrade the player's weaponry. The game's level design is also much more linear in scope and any key items the player comes upon will likely be used up mere moments later. Though the player will still have to solve numerable puzzles across the game.</p><p>The series' divisive <a href="/tank-controls/3015-4647/" data-ref-id="3015-4647">tank controls</a> are still in effect, though are ameliorated by an <a href="/over-the-shoulder/3015-2621/" data-ref-id="3015-2621">over-the-shoulder</a> perspective and this, with the addition of <a href="/laser-sight/3055-1819/" data-ref-id="3055-1819">laser sights</a>, improves weapon aiming. Player characters cannot 'run n gun', however, and any attempt at firing a weapon requires that the player must first perch themselves to the ground in classic Resident Evil fashion. Although unlike most shooters, the common enemies the player will come into conflict with--while not technically zombies--are generally slow in movement and almost-exclusively use melee weapons.</p><p>A dedicated <a href="/knife/3055-295/" data-ref-id="3055-295">knife</a> button allows <a href="/close-quarters-combat/3015-865/" data-ref-id="3015-865">close-quarters combat</a> without an inventory visit, reinforcing a faster pace of action. Switching firearms still requires the player to return to the inventory menu, however. <a href="/context-sensitive/3015-190/" data-ref-id="3015-190">As first introduced in </a><a href="/resident-evil-3-nemesis/3030-5587/" data-ref-id="3030-5587">Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</a>, simultaneously pressing back and the 'run' button will have Leon do a 180 degree turn.</p><p>By default RE4 has two difficulty settings, Easy and Normal. Upon completing the game will a higher setting become unlocked, called Professional Mode. Each difficulty increases the attack &amp; damage modifiers up from the last.</p><h3>Melee Attacks</h3><p>Another new mechanic is that of melee attacks. While Leon will forever have his knife available, he can also perform a number of button prompt melee attacks. These are initiated by first stunning an enemy, which is most commonly done by shooting it in the face. This will then allow the player to perform a roundhouse kick. Shooting an enemy in the leg so it'll fall to its knees will also trigger a melee attack, be it a straight-kick or a suplex depending on the type of ganado. Leon is invulnerable amidst the melee attack animation, making it efficient for both offensive and defensive maneuvers.</p><h3>Inventory Tetris</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3381/284867-s18106_ps2_4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-284867" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3381/284867-s18106_ps2_4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-284867"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Leon's Attache Case." class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3381/284867-s18106_ps2_4.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3381/284867-s18106_ps2_4.jpg" alt="Leon's Attache Case."></noscript></a><figcaption>Leon's Attache Case.</figcaption></figure><p>Leon's attache case, unlike inventory in the past, is gridded with a number of squares. Items occupy a certain number; the player must arrange and re-arrange weapons, ammunition and herbs, among other things, to best utilize his space. Using, combining, discarding and selling items are all integral to grid management. Larger attache cases can be bought. Treasures, which can be sold to the merchant, and key items are housed in a separate menu.</p><h3>Health &amp; Healing Items</h3><p>Another alteration from the previous games is the health system. Leon's health is no longer governed by a series of statuses and is now represented by a quarter-circle that wraps around the ammo icon. The color scheme still persists, with green indicating Leon is in good health, yellow to notify he's in danger, and red as a warning to the player that he is approaching death. When his health goes into yellow or red, Leon will be shown to hold onto his side.</p><p>Herbs are once again available for use, as are first aid sprays. The classic green and red varieties persist, although there are no longer any blue herbs as the chance of being poisoned has been removed entirely. Though in their stead is the introduction of yellow herbs, which can be used to marginally increase Leon's health until it fills the entire three quarter circle. However they can only be taken whence they've been mixed with at least one green herb.</p><p>The healing properties of herbs is locked, regardless of how much overall health Leon has. This means that at the beginning of the game a single herb can heal most of Leon's current health.</p><p>A mixture of herbs and their healing effects (when Leon has attained his maximum health limit) are as follows:</p><ul><li><b>Green Herb</b> - On its own will restore 25% of health.</li><li><b>Red Herb</b> - On its own does nothing.</li><li><b>Green + Green Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character by roughly 50% of health.</li><li><b>Green + Green + Green Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character completely.</li><li><b>Green + Red Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character completely.</li></ul><p>Beyond herbs are eggs the player can collect as well. There are three varieties, each healing a higher percentage than the last, though eggs cannot be combined for greater effects. They are generally found after killing a snake, or by chasing a chicken long enough for it to lay an egg. Chickens are only encountered in the early stages of the game, and eggs can eventually only be acquired by killing a snake.</p><p>The three egg types are:</p><ul><li><strong>White</strong> - Roughly heals about 10% of health</li><li><strong>Brown</strong> - Roughly heals about 40% of health</li><li><strong>Gold</strong> - Will fully heal a character.</li></ul><h3>Secondary Character AI</h3><h4>Ashley Graham</h4><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2769656-resident_evil_4_ultimate_hd_edition-2448037.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2769656" data-ratio="0.55625" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:55.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2769656-resident_evil_4_ultimate_hd_edition-2448037.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2769656"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2769656-resident_evil_4_ultimate_hd_edition-2448037.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2769656-resident_evil_4_ultimate_hd_edition-2448037.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2769656-resident_evil_4_ultimate_hd_edition-2448037.jpg" alt="2769656-resident_evil_4_ultimate_hd_edition-2448037.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>During key points in the game, the player is tasked with escorting and safeguarding Ashley Graham. She functions as her own character with her own health bar, however she has no means of attack. Instead, the player can choose between telling her to wait or to follow; when told to wait she will stay on the spot until told otherwise. When following she will always trail behind Leon, never getting in the way of his aim, and will also even duck out of the way should Leon's laser sight happen to cross Ashley.</p><p>Besides being told to simply wait on the spot, there are a number of trash dumpsters that Leon can tell Ashley to hide in; Leon can then whistle to signal it's safe for her to come out. When in a dumpster she is completely hidden from sight from enemies.</p><p>Ashley is just as vulnerable as Leon and can die from only a couple of attacks. Although her health can also be extended much like Leon if she is given a herb mixture to heal containing a yellow herb. While she makes a concerted effort to stay clear of Leon's aim, she isn't invincible to friendly-fire and can be shot by the player. Beyond simply being attacked, Ganado will also often attempt to carry her away; they will be shown carrying her on their shoulder, and should they exit the area then the game will be over. It will only take a single shot to knock the Ganado off balance, dropping Ashley in the process.</p><p>There is one occasion where players will actually take control of Ashley. Still without any means of attack, players are to instead crawl under tables to maneuver around enemy encounters. Though she can throw lamps at enemies to set them on fire, it will only temporarily knock them to the ground. Ashley's segment as such is puzzle focussed, though she can also acquire supplies that she'll then give to Leon when she returns to him.</p><p>On other occasions Ashley will attempt to operate a piece of machinery while Leon must protect her. This includes her turning a number of cranks, to driving a huge bulldozer. Players will also sometimes require Ashley's help to push forward a large crate.</p><h4>Luis Sera</h4><p>During one particular set-piece, players will work alongside Luis to defend themselves within a small house from an onslaught of Ganado. Luis is equipped with a Red 9 handgun and will make a concerted effort to dispatch as many enemies as possible. He will shoot enemies off of Leon if he is grabbed by one and will thank the player in kind if they return the favor. Like Ashley, Luis will duck if is caught in Leon's laser sight.</p><p>Luis has infinite ammo and is invulnerable, and will also drop supplies for Leon to collect. However it's possible for Luis to kill Leon. Though while still invincible, if the player shoots Luis five times then a short cutscene will trigger, showing Luis gun down Leon with the words ''Adios, Leon...'', resulting in a game over.</p><h4>Dog</h4><p>Early in the game, the player will likely notice a dog trapped in a bear trap. If freed, the dog will arrive to help the player against the first El Gigante encounter. While it won't actually attack the monster, it will furiously bark at it, calling its attention away and giving the player ample time to attack. Once the boss battle is over the dog will have disappeared and isn't encountered again.</p><h4>Mike</h4><p>During a late game event, Leon will have air support courtesy of a minor character called <a href="/mike/3005-9954/" data-ref-id="3005-9954">Mike</a>. Piloting an attack helicopter, he will provide assistance against the ganado and also against the turret placements throughout the area. If Leon is too close to one of the towers Mike needs to destroy to help Leon advance, he will repeatedly yell for Leon to get out of the way until he does so. Mike is invincible for this segment and has infinite ammo.</p><p>On Professional Mode Mike will only shoot down the towers so Leon can progress and will not help with any of the turrets or ganado.</p><h3>Quick Time Events</h3><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2769659-re4-qte.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2769659" data-ratio="0.58875219683656" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:58.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2769659-re4-qte.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2769659"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2769659-re4-qte.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2769659-re4-qte.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2769659-re4-qte.jpg" alt="2769659-re4-qte.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>Resident Evil 4, alongside <a href="/god-of-war/3030-6959/" data-ref-id="3030-6959">God of War</a>, was a pioneer in implementing <a href="/quick-time-event/3015-6/" data-ref-id="3015-6">QTE</a>s to include some additional interaction within the cutscenes. Thus during many of the game's cutscenes, players will be required to quickly press the on-screen prompts to escape danger. This can vary from pressing/mashing the face buttons (sometimes simultaneously), to pressing the shoulder buttons, to wiggling the left analogue stick. Failure to do so will result in Leon's gory demise, with each failed cutscene QTE featuring a unique death scene.</p><p>Outside of cutscenes, QTEs are utilised to escape from an enemy that has grabbed the player, more often than not by wiggling the left analogue stick. While failing to meet the QTE demands mid-gameplay won't always result in Leon's death, it will lead to him taking more damage. As with the cutscenes, dying to an in-game QTE struggle will sometimes 'reward' the player with a unique death animation for Leon.</p><h3>Shooting Range Minigame</h3><p>The player, at certain points, gains access to <a href="../../shooting-range/92-1932/" rel="nofollow">Shooting Galleries</a>. There are four galleries and eight courses in total. The player's tasked with shooting cardboard Ganados while avoiding Ashley's (which deduct points); there is also a Salazar target. There is, occasionally, a Ganado with a lighted stick of dynamite that can be shot in order to destroy all targets within the vicinity.</p><p>Each course, amid its action, gives the player a chance to reload; this occurs once per course for about three seconds. Points are awarded for hitting enemy targets, and a certain number of them unlock bottle cap figurines.</p><p>Six bottle caps may be won at each range. Upon each completed row of bottle caps, the player is awarded money, starting at five thousand and increasing another five thousand with each row. One bottle cap may be earned by obtaining 4,000 points or hitting all enemy targets, while the other five require earning 3,000 points multiple times. Each course changes its target layout after the player obtains a certain number of bottle caps from it. The bottle caps can be viewed in the Key Item Inventory. Each bottle cap features an audio clip whose quality is similar to actual sound-playing toys.</p><p>The points for each target are as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Male Ganado:</strong> 100 points, 200 for headshot.</li><li><strong>Female Ganado:</strong> 200 points, 300 for headshot.</li><li><strong>Ashley Graham:</strong> Minus 1000 points, minus 2000 for headshot.</li><li><strong>Ramon Salazar Head:</strong> 500 points.</li></ul><h3>Saving</h3><p>As with the earlier games in the series, Resident Evil 4 requires players use one of the numerable typewriters in the game to save. Only now the player no longer requires any sort of <a href="/ink-ribbon/3055-526/" data-ref-id="3055-526">item </a>before hand and there are a greater number of typewriters located throughout the game.</p><h3>New Game +</h3><p>Upon completing the game, players can then start a new with all of their upgraded weaponry and such right from the start. However this can only be done on the same difficulty; any attempt at starting a new game on a different difficulty requires that players start over from scratch.</p><h2>Story</h2><h3>Main Characters</h3><h4>Leon S.

Saddler has injected Plagas into Ashley, Luis, and Leon, and their fates are not unlike the villagers. Saddler plans to have Ashley, once transformed, infiltrate the United States. This would allow Los Illuminados to take over. Leon, resolute, resumes looking for the president's daughter. He arrives at a lake, where he sees Ganados disposing of the body of the second policeman. It is eaten by a monstrous, mutated lizard, Del Lago. Leon faces the creature, managing its slay with harpoons. He collapses in a lakeside cabin. He has nightmares, due to complications from his infestation. He discovers the location of Ashley and doubles back to the church in the village.</p><p>On his way, he faces El Gigante, an enormous troll-like creature. A dog, if freed earlier, will assist Leon during the fight. Leon arrives at the church and saves Ashley. Saddler appears, announcing that the parasite is growing inside of their bodies. The two escape and head for the extraction point. They find themselves, however, barricaded with Luis in a cabin. They defend against a large number of Ganados. Luis parts ways with Leon. The helicopter that was supposed to retrieve the two heroes, unfortunately, is shot down. Hunnigan reports that a second one should be incoming. Leon sights a castle nearby and deems it an optimal hiding place. To access the castle, however, Mendez's glass eye is necessary. Leon confronts Mendez in a barn. Mendez transforms into a monster, but Leon attains the eye. Ashley and Leon enter the castle.</p><p>They discover that the castle is the religious center of Los Illuminados. Monks, using catapults and other medieval weapons, try to kill Leon and capture Ashley. One of Saddler's top men, the castle's castellan, <a href="/ramon-salazar/3005-4569/" data-ref-id="3005-4569">Ramon Salazar</a>, jams all of Leon's communications. This prevents communication with Hunnigan, although Salazar frequently calls Leon to taunt him. The two fight through the castle. Ashley starts coughing blood and, in her panic, she runs into a trap. Leon must save her again. He meets ex-colleague <a href="/ada-wong/3005-1106/" data-ref-id="3005-1106">Ada Wong</a>, who already saved himself from Mendez. Ada has a private agenda (she's working for "the Organization") and remains enigmatic with Leon. Before Leon can wrest any information from Ada, she escapes. Leon spots Ashley, just out of reach. Luis arrives, flashing two antidotes and the mysterious "Sample", which Saddler needs, as Ada (per order of <a href="/albert-wesker/3005-627/" data-ref-id="3005-627">Albert Wesker</a>). Unfortunately, Luis is impaled by Saddler before any exchange occurs. Leon swears to avenge Luis. He frees Ashley, who treks alone through the castle and then reunites. They set off again. Ashley, shortly, is captured by Novistadors.</p><p>Leon makes his way to Salazar, killing <a href="/verdugo/3005-5922/" data-ref-id="3005-5922">Verdugo</a>, Salazar's "right hand" and chief bodyguard. He's informed that Ashley has been taken to a research facility on a nearby island. Salazar transforms into a giant, mutated creature. A boss fight commences. Leon rides to the island with Ada and fights Saddler's heavily armed Ganados. He finds Ashley, finally, along with the "Sample" and a machine, which uses electricity and radiation to destroy Plagas within a host. Ashley and Leon free themselves of infestation and attempt to leave; they are confronted by Saddler. He transforms into a crab-like monster and attacks. Leon, with the help of Ada, manages to kill Saddler. They end the threat of Los Illuminados, once and for all. Ada does, however, steal the "Sample" from Leon and sets the island blow. Leon and Ashley have three minutes.</p><p>The two manage to escape on a jet ski, just seconds before the island blows. From the impact, Ashley is flung from the vehicle; Leon briefly searches for her, and then picks her up. As Leon does so, he says, "Let's go home". In agreement, Ashley responds: "mission accomplished". A scene is shown of the two traveling into the ocean, Ashley asks Leon: "After you take me back to my place, how about we <a href="/sex/3015-561/" data-ref-id="3015-561">do some overtime</a>?". Leon politely refuses.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><h3>Merchant</h3><p>Throughout Resident Evil 4 the player will come across a travelling Merchant, who will offer new weapons and items for the player to purchase. The player can also sell anything that isn't a key item (apart from the knife) to the Merchant and upgrade weapons via interacting with him. At first, the Merchant’s weapons and upgrades will become available at set times throughout the game; however, on a second game, everything will be available from the start.</p><p>Below is a complete breakdown of all the weapons, their upgrade costs (in parenthesis) and statistics: firepower, firing speed, reload speed, and magazine capacity. Exclusive upgrades are also detailed. Note that on the scale of Firepower stats, a "1.0" is considered equal to the damage of a single bullet from Leon's default pistol without any upgrades, and all weapon damage is compared to this.</p><h3>Pistols</h3><h4><a href="/pistol/3055-59/" data-ref-id="3055-59">Handgun</a></h4><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Level</th><th scope="col">Firepower</th><th scope="col">Firing Speed</th><th scope="col">Reload Speed</th><th scope="col">Capacity</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>0.47</td><td>1.73</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>1.2 (7,000)</td><td>0.40 (5,000)</td><td>1.47 (5,000)</td><td>13 (4,000)</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>1.4 (10,000)</td><td>0.33 (12,000)</td><td>0.87 (12,000)</td><td>16 (6,000)</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>1.6 (15,000)</td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>1.8 (18,000)</td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>2.0 (20,000)</td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td></tr></tbody></table><p>Notes: The Handgun's exclusive upgrade increases the likelihood of one a one-hit kill by fivefold.</p><h4>Punisher</h4><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Level</th><th scope="col">Firepower</th><th scope="col">Firing Speed</th><th scope="col">Reload Speed</th><th scope="col">Capacity</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>0.9</td><td>0.47</td><td>1.70</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>1.1 (10,000)</td><td>0.40 (10,000)</td><td>1.47 (8,000)</td><td>13 (8,000)</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>1.3 (15,000)</td><td>0.33 (20,000)</td><td>0.83 (18,000)</td><td>16 (10,000)</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>1.5 (20,000)</td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>1.7 (25,000)</td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>1.9 (35,000)</td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td></tr></tbody></table><p>Notes: The Punisher has the unique attribute of allowing each shot to penetrate one enemy and hit another one behind the first target.

While still rather slow in movement, the Ganado are much more intelligent and capable than your average zombie. They are shown to work in groups, can wield a variety of weaponry, climb ladders, and will make an effort in keeping their head clear from the player's laser sight. Though while they are of a much greater intelligence than zombies, their infected state via a nerve-attached parasite leaves them to act rather sluggish and are much slower to react than an ordinary person. But on the flipside they don't respond to pain quite as vividly as a person would. A shot to the face will make them temporarily stagger in pain, but only for a few seconds before they return to their advance.</p><p>They have few defensive abilities and will generally attempt to swarm the player via their larger numbers and sheer aggression. Though to account for the player's inability to move &amp; shoot, they will rush towards the player only before slowing down to walking speed when they reach a certain proximity. As such, the Ganado still retain numerous zombie-like qualities despite being of a much more aggressive design.</p><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2769701-maxresdefault.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2769701" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2769701-maxresdefault.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2769701"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2769701-maxresdefault.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2769701-maxresdefault.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2769701-maxresdefault.jpg" alt="2769701-maxresdefault.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>Aiming for the head is still a suitable tactic, and may result in the head being completely destroyed, though shooting other regions can be beneficial as well. Players can shoot their arm to make them drop their weapon should they have one equipped, and if a Ganado is in mid-sprint then shooting their legs will have him topple to the floor, leaving him extremely vulnerable to attack. Ganado won't bite players, but if one gets close enough then they'll grab and attempt to strangle the player character; Leon's health will begin to deplete all the while this is happening. Wiggling the stick will eventually knock them away, and may even result in destroying their head amidst the animation, though if the player fails the QTE then Leon will be thrown to the floor dealing a sizeable amount of damage.</p><p>If a Ganado has a weapon, it will often use it as a melee weapon, but will sometimes instead hurl it at the player - to which can be shot out of the air by the player. Once thrown the ganado will then pull out another from its back pocket.</p><p>There are three distinct varieties of Ganado, one for each of the three main environments of the game. While they all largely function the same, they each wield different weaponry.</p><h4>Villager Ganado</h4><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5322/522475-villageois_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-522475" data-ratio="0.8" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5322/522475-villageois_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-522475"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="522475-villageois_2.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5322/522475-villageois_2.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5322/522475-villageois_2.jpg" alt="522475-villageois_2.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>These are the ganado that populate the beginning village segment. The villager ganado are the weakest variant in the game and wield a series of rudimentary weapons, such as pitchforks, hatchets, sickles, and sometimes dynamite.</p><p>The villager Ganado will make a late game reappearance in the Mines near the final stretch of the Castle environment.</p><h4>Cultist Ganado</h4><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2769699-the_los_illuminados.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2769699" data-ratio="0.7" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:70.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2769699-the_los_illuminados.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2769699"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2769699-the_los_illuminados.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2769699-the_los_illuminados.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2769699-the_los_illuminados.jpg" alt="2769699-the_los_illuminados.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>The Ganado that patrol the castle owned by Ramon Salazar. The Cultists can withstand much more damage than the villagers and wield more effective weaponry. These range from scythes to flails, and are also sometimes equipped with wooden shields. The shields can be shot through with a single shotgun round, but can otherwise prove to be a danger when multiple are advancing unto Leon while equipped with shields. The shields themselves can be used as a weapon as well, which will knock Leon to the ground.</p><p>As with the villagers they will sometimes throw their scythes, which have the potential to decapitate Leon killing him immediately. Should they throw their scythe they will from them on rely on their regular melee attacks and will not equip another.</p><p>For ranged they rely on crossbows. They don't deal a lot of damage per shot, but are instead meant to harass from afar. Only one shot can be fired at time before they must reload at least. Some Cultists will also be encountered while equipped with an RPG launcher. Such encounters are extremely rare, however.</p><p>Certain ganado cultists are wearing a golden skull or jackal mask, whom are completely invincible to shots to the head. Some are also shown to be wearing red robes as opposed to black; any who wear red are of a higher position and will always drop a valuable jewel upon their death, though they also require more punishment to kill.</p><h4>Militia Ganado</h4><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2769702-ganado_militia.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2769702" data-ratio="0.70071258907363" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:70.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2769702-ganado_militia.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2769702"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2769702-ganado_militia.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2769702-ganado_militia.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2769702-ganado_militia.jpg" alt="2769702-ganado_militia.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>These are the final ganado variety the player will face. They're the strongest of all types and are the most aggressive. Their weapons consist of many of the same as the other types, such as crossbows, dynamite, flails, shields, and occasionally RPGs. Though they also have cattle prods which deal a heavy amount of damage even over other melee weapons. Some are also shown to be wearing a helmet, which like the cultist masks means this ganado is invincible to any shots to the head.</p><p>There is a type of militia ganado that is much taller and heavily armored than the rest. It is armored over much of its torso and most of its head, and wields a huge hammer. Its movement is slower than that of a regular ganado, but its attacks deal more damage and it can withstand more damage before dying.</p><h3>Ganado Plagas Mutations</h3><p>At a certain point in the story, the las plagas parasite will sometimes be shown to burst out of its host after the ganado has received a certain amount damage. Whether a ganado will mutate or not is random, though upon doing so all previous damage is made redundant and the ganado will have regained full health.</p><h4>Plagas A</h4><p>The most common plagas among all ganado. The plagas A is a small, bulbous collection of eyes and tentacles, one of which will stretch out to reveal a sharp axe-like end that it'll use to strike at the player. Shooting the plagas is the primary means by which to now kill the creature, as well as to force the axe tentacle to recede back for a split-second.</p><h4>Plagas B</h4><p>Plagas B are first encountered when going up against the cultists, but also appear amongst the Militia Ganado. This plagas resembles a small sort creature, though once it gets close will rapidly increase in size and attempt to bite the player character's head clean off. As with Plagas A, shooting the plagas itself will force it to recede away for a split-second so as to halt its instant-kill attack.</p><h4>Plagas C</h4><p>The final plagas mutation. Plagas C is first shown to be a bunch of skittering legs, which will shoot acid at the player from a distance. After it receives enough it damage, it will then separate from its host completely and operate independently as a sort of arachnid-like creature. Though once it's become separated it is now extremely vulnerable and will die by but a few handgun shots or knife swipes.</p><p>Plagas C will on very few occasions be encountered independent of any host.</p><h3>Chainsaw Ganado</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2769704-193005__resident-evil-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2769704" data-ratio="2.2613065326633" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:226.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2769704-193005__resident-evil-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2769704"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2769704-193005__resident-evil-4.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2769704-193005__resident-evil-4.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2769704-193005__resident-evil-4.jpg" alt="2769704-193005__resident-evil-4.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>An extremely dangerous mini boss enemy of sorts. As their name implies, Chainsaw Ganado are equipped with a chainsaw, which is an instant-kill should they get close enough to Leon. Besides their powerful offensive capabilities, Chainsaw Ganado can withstand a much higher degree of damage than regular ganado. Though they'll be knocked to the ground like any other, and as such can be stunlocked so long as the player has the ammunition. A Chainsaw Ganado will always drop a valuable jewel upon their death, if not 10,000 gold.</p><p>There are two cosmetic varieties of Chainsaw Ganado, though they each share the same properties. Chainsaw Ganado are only encountered in the village and mine environments of the game. An alternate name for the Chainsaw Ganado is 'Dr. Salvador', as that's the name for the Chainsaw Ganado bottlecap. While they wear a burlap sack over their head, it doesn't increase their head defense. Chainsaw Ganado will also never mutate.</p><p>There are a pair of sisters that wield chainsaws as well which are encountered during one specific segment of the game. Despite their different appearance they still function the exact same as a regular Chainsaw Ganado.</p><h3>Colmillos</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2769706-colmillos.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2769706" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2769706-colmillos.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2769706"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2769706-colmillos.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2769706-colmillos.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2769706-colmillos.jpg" alt="2769706-colmillos.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>Vicious dogs that have been infected with las plagas. Colmillos are extremely dangerous as is and will launch at the player and attempt to maul them, requiring the player to rapidly waggle the analogue stick to escape. After so long they will unleash their plagas parasites, which burst out of their back and can then be used as a long range series of whips. Though unlike ganado plagas mutations, for Colmillos the plagas is bound to expose itself regardless of how much it has taken before hand.</p><p>These creatures are only encountered in two locations, being the graveyard outside the church and the castle maze.</p><h3>Novistador</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2769707-re4_novistador.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2769707" data-ratio="1" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2769707-re4_novistador.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2769707"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2769707-re4_novistador.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2769707-re4_novistador.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2769707-re4_novistador.jpg" alt="2769707-re4_novistador.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>Strange, insect-like creatures that somewhat resemble the chimera from the original Resident Evil. Novistador have two varieties. The first is completely invisible and will attempt to ambush the player, though when it attacks the player has a split-second chance to press a button prompt to counter the ambush. When they've been attacked they'll temporarily lose their invisibility, though can still regress back into it in order to escape and try again. It primarily attacks by slashing when up close or doing a dive-kick when further away, which if hit will knock Leon right to the ground.</p><p>The second variety is always visible, though they have the ability of flight. They also have an additional attack to where they'll grab Leon and vomit acid all over his face, requiring the player to wiggle the analogue to escape from their grasp.</p><h3>Garrador</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2769705-re4-garrador.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2769705" data-ratio="1" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2769705-re4-garrador.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2769705"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2769705-re4-garrador.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2769705-re4-garrador.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2769705-re4-garrador.jpg" alt="2769705-re4-garrador.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>A recurring mini boss enemy during the castle segment. Garradors are tall creatures equipped with a large claw on each hand. While they may be completely blind, they have highly acute hearing. Upon noticing the player it will rush to their vicinity and madly swing around the area. Their other most notable attack is their charging lunge attack, to which will kill a player instantly should they get caught by it. It may alternatively lead to the Garrador getting its claw stuck into a wall, allowing the player some easy shots at its plagas weak-point located on its back.</p><p>When attacking with explosives such as grenades, it may then fall over onto the ground with its back exposed, again allowing for some easy potshots.</p><h3>Armadura</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2769709-armadura.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2769709" data-ratio="1.0825958702065" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:108.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2769709-armadura.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2769709"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2769709-armadura.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2769709-armadura.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2769709-armadura.jpg" alt="2769709-armadura.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>Suits of armor that are inhabited by las plagas parasites. Some are encountered amidst QTEs, to which will strike down at the player before then crumbling to the floor. Though some are encountered as enemy units, which will use whatever weapon the suit is equipped with--be it an axe or sword--to attack the player. Due to their armor they are highly resistant to damage and can be difficult to make flinch. After enough damage the plagas will burst from the helmet, revealing itself. Damage dealt to the plagas is now the most effective, though the creature is still highly resistant to flinching all the same. What plagas type that'll burst out of an Armadura can be between each of the three A, B, and C varieties.</p><p>These creatures are only encountered during a couple of instances in the castle.</p><h3>Regenerador</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2769710-2030050-re4_iron_maiden.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2769710" data-ratio="1.4285714285714" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:142.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2769710-2030050-re4_iron_maiden.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2769710"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2769710-2030050-re4_iron_maiden.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2769710-2030050-re4_iron_maiden.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2769710-2030050-re4_iron_maiden.jpg" alt="2769710-2030050-re4_iron_maiden.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>One of the most formidable enemies in the game. Regeneradors are first made known during the Island segment of the game. As their name implies, they have the unique ability to regenerate any and all wounds the player inflicts. The only way to permanently kill a regenerador is to kill the plagas parasites within. Players can simply keep shooting at the creature in the hopes of hitting one, though by this point players will have access to a thermal scope to attach onto their semi-auto sniper rifle. With this players can pinpoint exactly where the parasites are. There are usually between 3-4; on Professional Mode there is always one on its back. The way to note if the player has shot one of its parasites is if the regenerador's whole body temporarily wobbles and expands. Once all parasites have been killed it will explode.</p><p>Regenerador's attacks are extremely powerful. It will primarily attack by getting close to the player to then rapidly munch on Leon's neck, requiring the player to wiggle the stick to escape. Though while it will at least walk slowly towards the player, its leg can be temporarily destroyed to slow it down even further. However its range of attack will actually increase without its legs, as from there it will leap off the floor a surprising distance to bite the player as before.</p><p>There exists an alternate variety to the regenerador called an Iron Maiden. Its one distinctive difference is that its body is comprised of a number of spikes, and if close enough will extend all of its spikes simultaneously at the player.</p><p>A sure way to note if a regenerador/iron maiden is within the vicinity is its distinct breathing that can carry across the whole area.</p><h3>Gatling Gun Ganado</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2769712-jj.png" data-ref-id="1300-2769712" data-ratio="1.2742857142857" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:127.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2769712-jj.png" data-ref-id="1300-2769712"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2769712-jj.png" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2769712-jj.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2769712-jj.jpg" alt="2769712-jj.png"></noscript></a></figure><p>Otherwise known as ''J.J'', gatling gun ganado are an infrequent mini boss that is encountered amidst the militia ganado. They have available a gatling gun with infinite ammo, which has a high range of attack. If the player is caught within its stream, it will only count as a single attack with a few brief seconds of invulnerability, allowing the player a chance to escape the weapon's range. If he can get close enough, he can also use his gatling gun as a melee weapon to knock Leon to the ground.</p><p>Gatling Gun ganado are pretty resistant to damage, though they can be temporarily stunned after enough shots to the head - this will not trigger a melee attack button prompt, however. Their red beret can also be shot off thisaway as well.</p><h2>Boss Battles</h2><h3>Del Lago</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2769725-dellago.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2769725" data-ratio="1.2779552715655" data-width="313" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 313px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:127.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2769725-dellago.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2769725"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2769725-dellago.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2769725-dellago.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2769725-dellago.jpg" alt="2769725-dellago.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>The first boss of the game, though one that is fought outside of the main gameplay design. Leon is instead riding a small dinghy boat with access to an unlimited supply of harpoons. After its anchor accidentally gets stuck on the creature, the boat is thusly pulled along the river. Players still have some control of the boat all the while and must thusly try to steer it away from the debris in the water, otherwise the collision will deal damage. All the while this is happening, the player can also throw harpoons at the creature. Though the animation for such is relatively lengthy and only allows the throwing 3-4 harpoons before it dives underwater.</p><p>During certain periods, Leon will completely lose track of the creature as the boat comes to a standstill. However it isn't long before waves begin swarming towards the boat; the screen will post arrows on the screen to point the player to the direction of the creature. Once it gets close enough it'll open its mouth, revealing the las plagas parasite; damage to this area is higher than anywhere else, and is necessary to halt its advance otherwise it'll slam into the boat dealing a high degree of damage.</p><p>Once enough damage has been done, the game will shift to a cutscene depicting Leon's leg being caught on a string of rope that's being pulled by the monster. The player must now mash the alternating face buttons in order for him to successfully cut the rope off.</p><p>Before the battle begins, Leon can potentially witness a short cutscene depicting one of the Spanish police officers that drove him here being dumped in the water to be eaten by Del Lago by heading up the alternate pathway. Upon reaching the boat, players can also shoot the river from their position, which will result in a unique death scene of Del Lago bursting out of the water to devour Leon.</p><h3>El Gigante</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2769726-el_gigante-2_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2769726" data-ratio="1.3339285714286" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:133.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2769726-el_gigante-2_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2769726"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2769726-el_gigante-2_.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2769726-el_gigante-2_.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2769726-el_gigante-2_.jpg" alt="2769726-el_gigante-2_.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>What is perhaps considered to be one of the game's most iconic boss battles. The El Gigante is a recurring boss that can be fought across the game up to three times, though only two are mandatory. El Gigante is huge, lumbering monstrosity, that uses sheer brute strength to kill anything that stands in its way.</p><h4>First Battle</h4><p>The first time Leon encounters the beast makes for the second boss encounter in the game. El Gigante is fought amidst a roughly circular arena, with some nearby huts that contain some additional supplies. However they are easily trounced by El Gigante should players attempt to take shelter for too long inside one.</p><p>El Gigante attacks with sheer brute force, as it stomps towards Leon in its attempt to grab and then squeeze to death. Should this happen the player needs to wiggle the stick to escape its grasp, with Leon stabbing its hand with his knife dealing minor damage in the process. If the player attempts to run underneath his legs, he will then do a swift kick forward - potentially knocking the player over to the ground if caught by it. It will also pick up a huge tree log and will horizontally swing to and fro; the player will be given a QTE prompt to avoid the attacks.</p><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2769727-re4pc_announcement_screen_13_1390215990.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2769727" data-ratio="0.55625" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:55.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2769727-re4pc_announcement_screen_13_1390215990.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2769727"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2769727-re4pc_announcement_screen_13_1390215990.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2769727-re4pc_announcement_screen_13_1390215990.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2769727-re4pc_announcement_screen_13_1390215990.jpg" alt="2769727-re4pc_announcement_screen_13_1390215990.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>Due to its size it's easy for the player to deal damage to it, though it's rather resistant all the same. Grenades work well in particular, as do flash grenades as well in temporarily halting his advance allowing the player to fire at him safely. After sustaining enough damage, it will then keel over in pain as a giant las plagas parasite bursts out of its back. From here the player can shoot at the plagas, run up and press the button prompt to initiate a QTE where Leon slashes at it with his knife, or both. So long as the player knows to start running towards it to initiate the QTE, it's possible to get in some shots without sacrificing the QTE chance. After about three such occurrences El Gigante will finally fall to the ground dead.</p><p>Should the player have freed the dog from the bear trap much earlier in the game, it will then arrive to provide assistance for the battle. It won't attack El Gigante but will instead bark at it to gain its attention, allowing the player a prime opportunity to unload into it.</p><h4>Second Battle</h4><p>The second battle plays out similarly as above beyond a few differences. The first is that the player is currently escorting Ashley Graham, who can also be killed by El Gigante. Furthermore, the battle arena this time is much slimmer than the first, with it being near impossible to get around the advance of El Gigante. The one upside is that there's a boulder precariously resting above; if timed right, the player can potentially shoot the boulder so it will land on El Gigante, dealing a significant degree of damage.</p><p>This boss encounter is technically optional, as the player is allowed to choose between two pathways to proceed. The other of which will instead send the player through a gauntlet of ganado. Though at the same time it's possible for the player to clear out both pathways for the sake of acquiring more gold and supplies.</p><h4>Third Battle</h4><p>The third and final fight against El Gigante is mandatory like the first. Though what differs here is that the player is forced to fight two El Gigantes simultaneously. To even the odds, players can instead head to the switch and pull it, opening up the large grate that, if timed right, will send one of the El Gigantes into the molten lava below. If players don't close the hatch, however, it's possible for the dying El Gigante to give one last attack before it dies.</p><p>Players can instead try to beat them both, which while more difficult also results in double the rewards, as the one that is sent into the lava takes its loot with it.</p><p>The arena is more circular like the first, and there exists a ladder the player can climb to reach a pulley, which can then be used to send the player to the opposite side of the arena, potentially making some distance between them and El Gigante.</p><h3>Bitores Mendez</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2769729-bitores.gif" data-ref-id="1300-2769729" data-ratio="1.768" data-width="250" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 250px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:176.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2769729-bitores.gif" data-ref-id="1300-2769729"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2769729-bitores.gif" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2769729-bitores.gif"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2769729-bitores.gif" alt="2769729-bitores.gif"></noscript></a></figure><p>The ''Big Cheese'' as Luis referred to him. Bitores is as first depicted as an incredibly tall person, though his true las plagas form is revealed for this boss battle.</p><p>The plagas takes the place of his spine, extending his already impressive height even further. He also has four new, lengthy appendages appointed on to his back, giving him a fair range of attack.</p><p>Mendez is made up of two stages. The first has him slowly walks towards the player, while using his back appendages to attack from afar. The battle arena is largely pretty small and makes it very difficult to run past him without fear of getting attacked. Though there is an upper level the player can climb one of the three ladders to, which contains additional supplies as well as a temporary haven from Mendez. Though even if he can't get up there, his appendages can and will attack the player if they stay up there for too long.</p><p>His primary weak spot is his new plagas spine, which after so much damage will then collapse along with his legs. This then initiates Mendez's second phase, to where he'll rely on his plagas appendages on his back to swing about throughout the area. This gives him an increased level of mobility. He will now attack by slashing with his own hands, and can keep track of the player much more acutely, such as by now leaping to the upper level of the area. Mendez's weak point is now his head, to which grenades and the few red explosive barrels located around the area work especially well.</p><h3>Verdugo</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2769733-verdugoprofilejpg1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2769733" data-ratio="1.1047058823529" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:110.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2769733-verdugoprofilejpg1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2769733"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2769733-verdugoprofilejpg1.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2769733-verdugoprofilejpg1.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2769733-verdugoprofilejpg1.jpg" alt="2769733-verdugoprofilejpg1.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>Salazar's ''right hand'', Verdugo is one of two mysterious creatures that serves Salazar. The first part of the battle has Leon attempt to avoid its attacks from the ceiling via QTEs. After reaching the console to turn the power for the elevator on, the room goes into lockdown. Then after turning the button on to try and unlock the door, Verdugo finally makes its appearance.</p><p>At this point the player is unlikely to kill Verdugo and must try to survive until the door opens. Once that happens the player can then attempt to wait and survive until the elevator is powered with more room to maneuver, thereby skipping the boss. Verdugo is nigh immune to regular gunfire, and must first be encased in nitrous oxide if the player aims to kill it, or wants to at least stall it while the elevator makes its descent. Fortunately there just so happens to be a number of NO canisters within the vicinity. Whence frozen the player is to unload whatever they have into it before it breaks out of the NO. Verdugo will routinely hound the player amidst the wait and many of its attacks require a successful QTE prompt to avoid.</p><p>Verdugo's patterns will remain as such, and the player is to continue utilising the canisters if they wish to kill it. Though there are only so many canisters available, and if they are all used up and Verdugo still lives, it's advisable the player must instead flee. Fleeing, however, will leave the player with zero rewards, whereas killing it will reward players with a unique treasure.</p><h3>Ramon Salazar</h3><p>Now at the halfway point, Salazar and his remaining henchman allow themselves to be enveloped by a humongus plant-like creature.</p><h2>Unlockables</h2><p>Upon completion of the game, the player is awarded with the content described hereunder:</p><h3>Costumes</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2769655-247070-resident-evil-4-windows-screenshot-yes-this-is-ashley-if-you.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2769655" data-ratio="0.8" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2769655-247070-resident-evil-4-windows-screenshot-yes-this-is-ashley-if-you.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2769655"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2769655-247070-resident-evil-4-windows-screenshot-yes-this-is-ashley-if-you.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2769655-247070-resident-evil-4-windows-screenshot-yes-this-is-ashley-if-you.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2769655-247070-resident-evil-4-windows-screenshot-yes-this-is-ashley-if-you.jpg" alt="2769655-247070-resident-evil-4-windows-screenshot-yes-this-is-ashley-if-you.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>A single completion on any difficulty will reward players two new costumes, though only one is available on the original GameCube version. All ports thereafter include the second. The first is Leon's classic RPD uniform from Resident Evil 2, and the second is a 1930s mobster outfit. While wearing the mobster outfit and equipping the Chicago Typewriter, Leon will flip his hat when players attempt to reload the infinite ammo tommy gun.</p><p>Either costume will also change other character's appearances as well. When wearing the RPD uniform, Ashley's outfit will have changed to a sort of clubbing outfit. When wearing the mobster outfit, Ashley will be shown wearing a suit of armor, which not only makes her completely invulnerable to damage but also makes her so she's too heavy to be carried off by a Ganado. Ada Wong's outfit will change as well, though she only has the one alternative outfit, being the special-ops outfit she wears in Assignment: Ada.</p><h3>Assignment: Ada</h3><p>Assignment: Ada is a non-canonical and single-player. <a href="../../ada-wong/94-1106/" rel="nofollow">Ada Wong</a> assaults the island base in search of five Las Plagas vials. There are no save points, however, it is significantly shorter than the main game. Upon collecting all vials, Ada battles mutated <a href="../../jack-krauser/94-3850/" rel="nofollow">Krauser</a>. The battle is unlike Leon's only in the setting (bridge), allowing less space to maneuver.</p><h3>The Mercenaries</h3><p>This minigame stations the player in an area wherein he must survive before chopper pick-up. The goal is to gain points by defeating enemies before time expires. There are five characters and four areas to choose from. Each character starts with different weapons, while each stage is equipped with ammo boxes, bonus timers, and time extenders. Three areas are redesigns from the main game, and the fourth is new.</p><p><b>Scoring</b></p><p>Upon starting Mercenaries, Leon is the only selectable character. To earn additional characters, the player must earn four stars on each stage. The village stage unlocks Ada Wong; the castle unlocks Krauser; the military base unlocks Hunk; and the water-world unlocks Wesker.</p><p>An unlockable weapon, the Handcannon, may be earned by attaining five stars on every level with all five characters.

Separate Ways follows Ada through the whole game and consists of 5 chapters, each taking place in a different section and time of the game. Players are given a small stash of weapons and ammo and can purchase (but not upgrade) weapons from the merchant. All the treasures from Leon's campaign also exist in Ada's, and in some cases are key items in her quest. Each chapter is preceded by a cutscene and ends with Ada giving a short audio report on a character vital to that chapter.</p><p>In Chapter 1, Ada has been tasked by Wesker to retrieve the Las Plagas sample. She arrives in the village at around the same time as Leon. Ada observes Leon in trouble during his skirmish with the villagers; in order to stop them from attacking Leon, she must quickly get to the church and ring its bell.</p><p>In Chapter 2, Ada has learned that Luis is in possession of the sample, but has gone missing. Ada needs to find him ASAP. She starts in Bitores Mendez' (the village chief's) house and must work her way back to the cabin, where Leon finds Luis. When she reaches the cabin, she finds that Leon and Luis have just been captured by Mendez. She backtracks to Mendez' house, just as Mendez and Leon meet in the hallway. Ada saves Leon from being killed by Mendez. Mendez gives chase to Ada, and tranquilizes her. Ada wakes up on the bloody altar found near the lift area, where she is about to be sacrificed by the villagers. She escapes, takes the lifts back and fights an El Gigante. She runs into Luis, finally, who was exiting the cabin where he and Leon had their late night hold-off from the villagers.</p><p>In Chapter 3, Ada is still in search of the sample held by Luis. The chapter starts at Leon and Ada first meeting, which was in the room overlooking the castle's garden maze. Ada flees Leon into the maze, and resolves to find Luis and the sample. Wesker orders Ada to kill Leon on sight, so Ada makes a pact to not run into him, as she does not want to hurt her former acquaintance. Ada does end up in the room of the castle where Leon finds Ashley in the shackles; she hides behind a column, as Luis is murderer by Saddler, in front of Leon. Saddler takes the sample from the corpse of Luis and escapes. Wesker tells Ada that there will be another time to retrieve the sample.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7383/2358878-adaways.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2358878" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5265625" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:52.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7383/2358878-adaways.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2358878"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Ada unleashing fire at the docks." class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7383/2358878-adaways.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7383/2358878-adaways.jpg" alt="Ada unleashing fire at the docks."></noscript></a><figcaption>Ada unleashing fire at the docks.</figcaption></figure><p>In Chapter 4, the game jumps ahead to the Island, where Ada and Krauser have become distrustful of each other. Krauser is ordered to do the job Ada couldn't do: kill Leon. Ada has to hurry to the room where Krauser and Leon fight, in order to stop Krauser. This chapter is the first to take place in an new section of the game: a ship dock littered with turrets and cannons. Ada hurries through the locale, and after a small scare on one of the ships, she stops the fight and saves Leon.</p><p>In Chapter 5, the final chapter, the mission is simple: retrieve the sample. Taking place at the very end of the game, Ada is making her way through the camp Leon had fought through with the help of his helicopter buddy, Mike. After she kills the straggler soldiers, she's confronted by Krauser again. This time, however, he wants to fight Ada. This fight takes place after Leon had "killed" Krauser; however, he is just as tough as he was in the Leon fight. Ada dispatches him. She makes her way towards the room where Leon and Ashley ran into Saddler. Ada interrupts their confrontation and makes the two run away. Ada faces Saddler, who is in a more human form than Leon is later exposed to. After the battle seems over, Ada grabs the sample; yet, she is captured, this time by Saddler. She wakes up just prior to Leon and Saddler's final fight. Leon releases her. Ada stands back as they fight, noticing a rocket launcher. Ada hurries to the launcher, and throws it to Leon, who uses it to destroy Saddler once and for all. Ada takes the sample from Leon, sets the island to self-destruct, and escapes on a helicopter. She returns the Plagas sample to Wesker, however, it is revealed a fake; Ada hands the real sample to an unknown, rival organization.</p><h3>Professional Mode</h3><p>Completing the game on Normal difficulty unlocks Professional mode, in which enemies have increased health, attack speed and power. Enemy drops likely contain more money but less ammo and quick time events require quicker mashing and reactions.</p><p>Once the player has completed professional mode, they unlock the Plaga Removal Laser 412 (P.R.L. 412), a laser rifle that has infinite ammo and can one-hit-kill almost every enemy and boss. The weapon can be acquired freely from <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/the-merchant/3005-1411/" data-ref-id="3005-1411">the Merchant</a> in a completed game.

It went through a long development period, during which various versions of the game were scrapped. One of its earlier builds was regarded as too great a departure from the series and was retooled and re-branded as <a href="/devil-may-cry/3030-13072/" data-ref-id="3030-13072">Devil May Cry</a>.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2628151-resident_evil_hook_man_930.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2628151" data-ratio="0.56236559139785" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2628151-resident_evil_hook_man_930.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2628151"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2628151-resident_evil_hook_man_930.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2628151-resident_evil_hook_man_930.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2628151-resident_evil_hook_man_930.jpg" alt="2628151-resident_evil_hook_man_930.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>A later version bore a greater resemblance to the previous Resident Evil's, retaining fixed camera angles and a focus on exploration and puzzles. Although when Leon aimed, the camera would switch to RE4's over-the-shoulder perspective. This version premised Leon's injection with the <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/progenitor-virus/3015-2049/" data-ref-id="3015-2049">progenitor virus</a> (as opposed to the parasite, Las Plagas) which caused hallucinations, introducing a psychological element to the game. Due to a ghostly apparition that wielded a hook for a weapon, this version has been coined the Hookman Build. Paul Mercier can still be heard providing the voice for Leon's cries of pain when attacked, and many of the build's sound effects originated from the <a href="/resident-evil/3030-27715/" data-ref-id="3030-27715">2002 Resident Evil remake</a>, such as the handgun firing, footsteps, and locked door sound effects. QTEs were shown to already be in effect for this build; the suits of armor that will attack Leon whence he gets close enough is another aspect that made it into the final release.</p><p>While initially directed by <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/kazuhiro-aoyama/3040-41247/">Kazuhiro Aoyama</a>, who is otherwise best known for directing <a href="/resident-evil-3-nemesis/3030-5587/" data-ref-id="3030-5587">Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</a>, troubles in development forced the build to be scrapped and for Mikami to then take over. He further believed that the Hookman build's themes were too 'supernatural'. Due to the poor sales of the Resident Evil remake back during its exclusivity on the Gamecube, Mikami opted to steer the series into a more action-focussed design.</p><h2>Differences between Regional Versions (JAP, U.S. and PAL)</h2><p>Other than the game being called BioHazard 4 in <a href="../../japan/95-37/" rel="nofollow">Japan</a>, there is a more subtle difference between the versions concerning Ashley Graham, as her breast size was increased overall for the game's US and PAL release. In addition, the Japanese version cuts some scenes featuring Dr. Salavador, the chainsaw Ganados, because of gore and violence.</p><p>The differences in the PAL version are found in mercenaries mode. Throughout each stage, the enemy counts and triggers are lowered, and rifle ammo will only appear in quantities of two and three, instead of three and five.</p><h2>Reception</h2><p>Resident Evil 4 was a large departure from the past Resident Evil games. <a href="../../capcom/65-367/" rel="nofollow">Capcom</a> stated that Resident Evil sales had been declining for some time, and that gamers - and even the producers themselves - were tiring of the old Resident Evil formula. Capcom took the risks involved with making changes, and the game was a blockbuster hit.</p><p>It sold millions of copies, more than any other Resident Evil game at the time, and became one of the highest rated games ever. It sold so well that Capcom ported the game to the <a href="../../playstation-2/60-19/" rel="nofollow">PS2</a>, ending the "<a href="../../gamecube/60-23/" rel="nofollow">GameCube</a> Only Deal". It was, moreover, ported to the <a href="../../pc/60-94/" rel="nofollow">PC</a> and then again to the <a href="../../nintendo/65-90/" rel="nofollow">Nintendo</a> <a href="../../wii/60-36/" rel="nofollow">Wii</a>. The PC port, while receiving positive reviews, was criticized for its sub-par keyboard controls, lack of mouse support and low quality cut-scenes. Because of Resident Evil 4's reception, its controls were kept and improved in <a href="../../resident-evil-5/61-20569/" rel="nofollow">Resident Evil 5</a>, pushing the action further.</p><h2>Ports</h2><p>Despite Mikami's intention of making Resident Evil 4 a Gamecube exclusive, the game ended up receiving more ports than any other game in the series. The HD remake released on Steam in 2014 is officially considered the "definitive edition" of the game.</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th>Publication</th><th>GameCube</th><th>PlayStation 2</th><th>PC</th><th>Wii</th><th>PS3</th><th>Xbox 360</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Metacritic</td><td>96/100</td><td>96/100</td><td>76/100</td><td>91/100</td><td>84/100</td><td>84/100</td></tr><tr><td>GameRankings</td><td>95.83%</td><td>95.85%</td><td>74.24%</td><td>91.45%</td><td>84.64%</td><td>86.00%</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>PlayStation 2</h3><p>Released on October 25, 2005 in North America, the PlayStation 2 features a brand new scenario called "Separate Ways", an exclusive campaign for Ada Wong. While nothing much was changed in translation, the PS2 version was criticized for its inferior graphics.</p><h3>PC</h3><p>The first PC port of Resident Evil 4 was developed by <a href="/sourcenext/3010-3364/" data-ref-id="3010-3364">SourceNext</a> in Hong Kong and published by <a href="/typhoon-games-ltd/3010-3146/" data-ref-id="3010-3146">Typhoon Games</a>. It was released in Japan on May 15, 2007, with March releases in Europe, North America and Australia, all of where it was published by <a href="/ubisoft-entertainment/3010-82/" data-ref-id="3010-82">Ubisoft</a>. This port contains the bonus features from the PS2 version, such as "Separate Ways", the P.R.L. 412 laser cannon, and a second set of unlockable costumes for Leon and Ashley, as well as an easy difficulty level. It also supports multiple widescreen resolutions. The shadow and lighting issues were fixed in the first and only patch for the game, Version 1.10.</p><p>Surprisingly, the PC port does not support the mouse.</p><h3>Nintendo Wii</h3><p>In May 2007, a re-release version of BioHazard 4 made its way to <a href="../../japan/95-37/" rel="nofollow">Japan</a>. This did not include any new features, save a trailer for <a href="/resident-evil-the-umbrella-chronicles/3030-11454/" data-ref-id="3030-11454">Resident Evil: Umbrella Chronicles</a>; however, it did retain extras from the <a href="../../playstation-2/60-19/" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 2</a>'s version and the <a href="/gamecube/3045-23/" data-ref-id="3045-23">GameCube's</a> visuals. Widescreen is anamorphic. This version allowed for aiming with the Wii's IR functionality.</p><p>The game is compatible with multiple controller schemes, including the following.</p><ul><li>Wiimote/Nunchuck</li><li>Classic Controller</li><li>GameCube Controller</li></ul><h3>iOS</h3><p>In July 2009, an <a href="../../iphone/60-96/" rel="nofollow">iPhone</a> version of Resident Evil 4 was released on the Japanese iTunes App Store. It came to the U.S. store, too; however, it is a drastically inferior, boiled-down level-based version of the game, much more arena shooting than adventuring. Capcom later created an iPad version.</p><h3>Xbox 360 and PS3</h3><p>On March 23, 2011, Capcom confirmed that Resident Evil 4 HD and <a href="../../resident-evil-code-veronica-x/61-8402/" rel="nofollow">Resident Evil: Code Veronica X</a> HD would come to <a href="../../xbox-live-marketplace/60-86/" rel="nofollow">Xbox Live Arcade</a> and the <a href="../../playstation-network-ps3/60-88/" rel="nofollow">PlayStation Network</a> as two separate downloads, on September 20, 2011 and September 27, 2011. Though it was also released as a disc compilation called the BioHazard Revival Selection, but only in Japan.</p><p>The HD version features all the extras from the previous releases.</p><h3>Steam Version, PC</h3><p>In January 2014, Capcom announced a new Steam version would release February 27th, 2014. It featured a visual overhaul, sixty frame per second, optimized wide screen, Steam achievements and trading cards, worldwide leaderboards, full-controller support, native keyboard and mouse support, subtitles in common languages and all content from previous versions. If the player pre-ordered, he received eighty pages of digital art and sixty-two songs in the official soundtrack.</p><h2>Trivia</h2><ul><li>Resident Evil 4 includes many references to the Luc Besson movie, <em>Léon: The Professional. </em>Not the least of which is of course Leon Kennedy sharing a first name, but also the burst-fire handgun Matilda, which references the Natalie Portman character of the same name, and the unlockable difficulty setting 'Professional' referring to <em>Léon's </em>subtitle.</li></ul><ul><li>The dog that Leon can save from a bear trap early in the game has a striking resemblance to <a href="/hewie/3005-2037/" data-ref-id="3005-2037">Hewie </a>from the survival horror game of the same year <a href="/haunting-ground/3030-2842/" data-ref-id="3030-2842">Haunting Ground.</a></li></ul><ul><li>The Merchant character's famous ''Whatta ya' buyin''' line has been referenced in innumerable games since, including <a href="/bayonetta/3030-20710/" data-ref-id="3030-20710">Bayonetta</a> and <a href="/dust-an-elysian-tail/3030-27691/" data-ref-id="3030-27691">Dust: An Elysian Tail</a>.</li></ul><ul><li>Nine years after the release of Resident Evil 4, Mikami directed <a href="/the-evil-within/3030-39750/" data-ref-id="3030-39750">The Evil Within</a>, which in itself is seen as a sort of <a href="/spiritual-successor/3015-425/" data-ref-id="3015-425">spiritual successor</a> to RE4 with many references therein to his previous work.

      <deck><![CDATA[The Mark of Kri is a mash up of American artwork styles like Disney and Don Bluth, a combination of Polynesian, Asian, and European cultures, and the kind of over the top, brutal violence of the Conan series, all swirled up into one unique, if linear, game.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p>The Mark of Kri is an action-stealth game released by SCEA San Diego Studios for the PlayStation 2 in 2003. The game allows the player to assume the control of Rau as he turns into a warrior under the instruction of his master, Baumasu. The game's central mechanic is using the right analog stick for targeting, to select and engage multiple targets in combat. The combat is deliberately paced, and rewards use of counter actions and well placed strikes above frequent strikes. Combat can end within a few strokes, or last for several minutes depending on how the player approaches each encounter. Battles can also be avoided using the stealth system, and while the game does not often allow the player to bypass fights, you can finish them before they start using vicious exectuions.</p><p>The art style of the game is a very distinct combination of Polynesian, Asian, South American, and Old European cultures, with character design similar to both Disney and Don Bluth's own unique styles. Most of the artists on the game's team came from prestigious companies such as Warner Bros, Disney, Dreamworks, and Don Bluth, thus explaining the artistic direction. The cutscenes in the game, both pre and post mission, unfold with "sketches" being drawn as the narrator, a servant to Rau, telling the story. The highlight of this being that, the last picture before the mission starts is fully colored in, and then as the game loads, the exact pose, camera angle, and locale shown in that last picture become the starting point of the mission.</p><p>The game features a rudimentary Achievements system, entitled Baumasu's Challenges. These range from instructions to perform certain combos on opponents, to using the unarmed stance to counter a certain number of enemies and take them out that way as opposed to basic combat. Also scattered around the levels are Tukus, special items that unlock a special reward after the last one is found.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The game controls with the left analog stick to move, with camera control mainly out of the player's hands.</p><p>Combat works in multiple fashions. The first thing the game teaches is how the melee combat works. The right analog stick projects a beam of light, entitled focus, that selects targets from enemies. Once the enemies are targeted, Rau's movement becomes centered around the opponent, strafing, circling, and dodging his, or their, attacks These targets are assigned to buttons on the face of the controller. Moves become contextual from there: If the player has one target, the X button (the first button assigned) is an attack button, while square and circle are combo modifiers, allowing the player to vary the combos into at most four hit combos which do not land as often thanks to the AI of enemy players. However, if they do land, the four hit combos are essentially instant kills, demonstrating Rau's incredible brutality as well as crispness in combat. As you gain more targets, they are assigned to the other two combat buttons, Square and Circle. From that point, pressing each button sends you to attack those opponents, with directional positioning playing a large part into what moves are available.</p><p>This mechanic stays the same with all three melee weapons, the Sword, Staff, and Axe. The differences between the weapons are basic. The sword is a middling weapon between strength and speed. The staff is fast, and allows the targeting of multiple enemies per weapon, but does significantly less damage. The Axe is lumbering and slow, but it's devastating power balances out the slow swipes. One errant swipe could end an entire battle if the enemies are close enough.</p><p>The second form of combat taught is stealth combat. The game uses the targeting system in a similar way, selecting targets. While holstered, Rau enters a stealth mode where he moves slower and does not have a drawn weapon for self defense. The last selected weapon determines what weapons are used for stealth kills, of which there are multiple. Multi-man stealth kills are also possible, where the player puts in a three button sequence to take down two enemies, one after another. You can also cling to walls, and target enemies. As they approach, inputting the button will grab them, pull them around the corner, and assassinating them out of sight.</p><p>One of the mechanics to assist with the stealth gameplay is Kuzo, Rau's spirit guide and the game's narrator. Taking the form of an eagle, Kuzo can perch on certain spots and survey areas ahead of Rau. Kuzo can also be used to pick up items on perches, set off switches and ladders, and read large inscriptions, giving history behind the markings on Rau's body.</p><p>The third form of combat taught is Archery, after a bow is awarded to you for completing the second mission. The Archery system is based on the arching of the arrows. After acquiring a target, Rau tracks the target automatically, leaving the player free to use the analog stick to arch the shot. The icon will flash repeatedly when the arc currently made would result in a headshot. A more advanced technique is to use Kuzo as a spotter if the enemy is off screen, and using the landings of the arrows to readjust until hits are scored on enemies.</p><p>Progression through the levels is mostly linear. On occasion, the player is presented with two paths, but they'll usually end up going to the same place, merely presenting different ways to deal with the same situation (stealth, or bust everyone up). After completing a level, Rau returns to a hub, a tavern near where he has grown up all of his life. From here he accepts jobs, talks to family and friends, and visits the Sage upstairs. The Sage carries a series of tarot cards, and is the in game interface to accessing in game content, such as the required commands for cheats, art, and cutscenes. It is also possible to retry the levels from here.</p><p>The unlocks come from both Baumasu's Challenges and the Tukus, spread around levels. Each level has five challenges and one Tuku. After all challenges are completed, an Arena is unlocked via the Sage in the hub area between levels. The arena has two modes, Time Attack and Body Count. Time Attack sets out a few waves of enemies and challenges the player to dispatch them as quickly as possible. Body Count gives players a time limit and a constant flow of enemies to violently dispatch how you please. Both modes offer all of the weapons without any progression, and it's the first chance the game gives you to hold Baumasu's axe and see the terrifying damage it renders. Each mode in the Arena has challenges, and as more arenas are unlocked, the challenges become more intricate and numerous. Completing all of the challenges for Time Attack stages unlocks concept art, while completing the challenges in Body Count unlocks costumes. If all of the Tukus are collected, Rau gains the ability to bring every weapon into prior levels.</p><h2>Creation of BottleRocket Entertainment</h2><p>Shortly after the release of The Mark of Kri, Jay Beard decided to start his own studio. Many of the people who worked on The Mark of Kri joined Jay Beard and created BottleRocket Entertainment. They were later commissioned by Sony to develop the sequel to The Mark of Kri, entitled The Rise of the Kasai.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p>Max Payne was developed by Finnish development house <a href="/remedy-entertainment-ltd/3010-1961/" data-ref-id="3010-1961">Remedy Entertainment</a>. This third-person action game was originally published for PC by <a href="/gathering-of-developers/3010-1152/" data-ref-id="3010-1152">Gathering of Developers</a> on July 25, 2001. The game was later ported to the <a href="/xbox/3045-32/" data-ref-id="3045-32">Xbox</a> and <a href="/playstation-2/3045-19/" data-ref-id="3045-19">PlayStation 2</a>, with these versions being published by <a href="/rockstar-games/3010-1194/" data-ref-id="3010-1194">Rockstar Games</a>. Since its initial release it has since been re-released on various platforms including the <a href="/xbox-360/3045-20/" data-ref-id="3045-20">Xbox 360</a>, <a href="/playstation-3/3045-35/" data-ref-id="3045-35">PlayStation 3</a>, <a href="/playstation-4/3045-146/" data-ref-id="3045-146">PlayStation 4</a> and mobile platforms. </p><p>The subject matter and visual style of Max Payne are heavily influenced by film noir and hard-boiled crime fiction, and its gun-heavy gameplay which takes very deliberate influence from <a href="/john-woo/3040-7888/" data-ref-id="3040-7888">John Woo</a> films, with <a href="/max-payne/3005-697/" data-ref-id="3005-697">Max</a> able to <a href="/dual-wielding/3015-135/" data-ref-id="3015-135">dual-wield</a> weapons, as well as jump into <a href="/bullet-time/3015-78/" data-ref-id="3015-78">bullet-time</a>, which causes the game to temporarily move in <a href="/slow-motion/3015-1323/" data-ref-id="3015-1323">slow-motion</a>, making it easier for the player to both <a href="/dodge/3015-2476/" data-ref-id="3015-2476">dodge</a> and aim shots.</p><p>The majority of the game's cut-scenes are shown in graphic novel form complete with dialogue to further advance the story.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Max Payne is a <a href="/third-person-perspective/3015-464/" data-ref-id="3015-464">third person</a> action shooter that features <a href="/bullet-time/3015-78/" data-ref-id="3015-78">bullet time</a>, a device that allows the player to slow down to easily take out enemies. The bullet time meter is a small <a href="/hourglass/3055-4291/" data-ref-id="3055-4291">hour glass</a> situated at the bottom of the screen. This meter begins to drain when bullet time is activated manually or by shoot dodging (slow motion diving). Bullet time can easily be regained by killing enemies. A simple health system is also incorporated into the game-play. A white silhouette of Max is placed at the bottom left of the screen and this indicates that Max is at full health. When the player is shot the silhouette begins to fill with red and it is when it is full that the player dies. To combat this the player collects and uses painkillers strewn throughout the game and this drains the red from the silhouette, restoring Max to full health.</p><p>Weapons play a crucial part in the overall game-play. The game features many weapons including pistols (many of which can be dual-wielded), shotguns and sniper rifles. The game also includes <a href="/projectiles/3015-3/" data-ref-id="3015-3">projectile weapons</a> including <a href="/grenade/3055-111/" data-ref-id="3055-111">grenades</a> and <a href="/molotov-cocktail/3055-75/" data-ref-id="3055-75">Molotov cocktails</a>.</p><p>Interactivity also adds depth to the game, many objects throughout the game can be interacted with. <a href="/television/3055-54/" data-ref-id="3055-54">TV's</a> can be turned on, <a href="/crate/3055-31/" data-ref-id="3055-31">boxes and crates</a> can be smashes and <a href="/functional-toilets/3015-5033/" data-ref-id="3015-5033">toilets can be flushed</a>.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>The game starts with <a href="/max-payne/3005-697/" data-ref-id="3005-697">Max Payne</a>, a young <a href="/new-york-city-police-department/3015-4253/" data-ref-id="3015-4253">NYPD</a> <a href="/police/3015-1011/" data-ref-id="3015-1011">cop</a>, coming home one night to find his family senselessly slaughtered by a gang of junkies, high on a synthetic drug named <a href="/valkyr/3055-1832/" data-ref-id="3055-1832">Valkyr</a>. That same drug has started to spread through <a href="/new-york-city/3035-109/" data-ref-id="3035-109">New York City</a> like a plague, and Max Payne sets out on a crusade for <a href="/revenge/3015-1363/" data-ref-id="3015-1363">revenge</a>.</p><p>The city is suffering greatly at the hands of the drug. Valkyr junkies are on an insane killing spree and many have died already. The Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA, make this new drug their immediate priority, to be stopped at any cost. Their plan is to use an undercover agent to infiltrate the ranks of the Mafia family that appears to be behind the distribution of the drug, and Max Payne, now a DEA special agent, is the man for the job. He begins to work undercover amongst the most nefarious mobster and murderers in the city.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7325/198012-maxpaynecomic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-198012" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.61375" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:61.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7325/198012-maxpaynecomic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-198012"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7325/198012-maxpaynecomic.jpg" alt="A scene from the cut-scene style of Max Payne."></a><figcaption>A scene from the cut-scene style of Max Payne.</figcaption></figure><p>While undercover, Max’s boss and best friend, Alex, who was the only one who knew his true identity, is murdered, and Max is framed for the act. The police think Max is a cop killer, and suddenly all the mobsters know all about him being a fed. Everyone is now out to get him. Max decides that he’s going to find his boss’ murderers and make them pay, in addition to tracking down the source of the Valkyr drug and make it's creators suffer.</p><p>Max seeks out the criminal Jack Lupino, who oversees Valkyr distribution for the <a href="/the-mafia/3015-1294/" data-ref-id="3015-1294">Mafia</a>. After killing him, he meets <a href="/mona-sax/3005-1129/" data-ref-id="3005-1129">Mona Sax</a>, who drugs him and leaves him to be found by the Mafia, who go and <a href="/interrogation/3015-5919/" data-ref-id="3015-5919">interrogate</a> him.</p><p>Max eventually escapes the Mafia and gains access to a shipment of guns belonging to the Russian mob. Max uses these guns to get into the house of the head of the Mafia. He finds out that the Don is actually a small part of the bigger picture in the Valkyr market when the Don is killed by cronies of Nicole Horne, CEO of a company called Aesir Corp. Horne then injects Max with an overdose amount of Valkyr and leaves him.</p><p>When he wakes up, he goes after his only source, the phrase “Cold Steel”, which he overheard just before he blacked out. It leads him to a foundry with an old secret military base below it. He discovers that the drug was the cause of a military project to enhance soldiers’ stamina; the project was canceled a short time after it started. He also finds out that his late wife accidentally stumbled upon the project while working at the DA’s office, and so <a href="/nicole-horne/3005-9321/" data-ref-id="3005-9321">Nicole Horne</a> let Valkyr addicts attack Max's home.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1550/181247-action1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-181247" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="480" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1550/181247-action1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-181247"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1550/181247-action1.jpg" alt="Max Payne shooting."></a><figcaption>Max Payne shooting.</figcaption></figure><p>After leaving the base, Max gets a call from his colleague B.B. Hensley. He asks Max to meet with him in a garage. There, Max shockingly realizes that B.B. was actually the person that shot Alex and framed Max in the process. A short fight entails in which B.B. is killed. Max receives a phone call from a guy named <a href="/alfred-woden/3005-4129/" data-ref-id="3005-4129">Alfred Woden</a>, telling him to go to the Asgard building. Alfred is a member of a secret organization known as the "Inner Circle". Woden informs Max about who Nicole Horne really is and says that the 'Inner Circle' can't go after Horne because they have other matters to attend to. They request Max to kill Horne in return for making sure that any criminal charges made against him are dropped. After the encounter, the room is raided by Horne's men. They kill everyone except Max, who swiftly escapes, and Woden, who pretends to have been shot.</p><p>Max enters the Aesir Corporations main building, where Horne is based. As he moves past the security guards and anyone else in his way, he runs into Mona Sax again. She is wounded by guards after refusing to kill Max. Max confronts Nicole and tells her that this whole chain of events started after Max's wife found out about the Valkyr drug project.

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p>Indigo Prophecy (or Fahrenheit, as it's known outside of North America) is an adventure game developed by <a href="/quantic-dream/3010-2005/" data-ref-id="3010-2005">Quantic Dream</a> and published by <a href="/atari-inc/3010-182/" data-ref-id="3010-182">Atari</a>. Indigo Prophecy's core focus is making the gameplay feel like an interactive movie with sophisticated story. It was designed by <a href="/david-cage/3040-20744/" data-ref-id="3040-20744">David Cage</a>, who portrays himself as an <a href="/non-player-character/3015-967/" data-ref-id="3015-967">NPC</a> in the tutorial and introduces the demo. The game has sold 700,000 copies worldwide.</p><p>The game was released as an <a href="/xbox-originals/3015-2345/" data-ref-id="3015-2345">Xbox Originals</a> title to the <a href="/xbox-live-marketplace/3045-86/" data-ref-id="3045-86">Xbox Live Marketplace</a>, clocking in at 1.90 gigabytes.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1367/179922-indigo_prophecy_20050921030730318.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-179922" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1367/179922-indigo_prophecy_20050921030730318.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-179922"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1367/179922-indigo_prophecy_20050921030730318.jpg" alt="Carla Valenti (left) and Lucas Kane (right)."></a><figcaption>Carla Valenti (left) and Lucas Kane (right).</figcaption></figure><p>The game starts off with the protagonist <a href="/lucas-kane/3005-1420/" data-ref-id="3005-1420">Lucas Kane</a> in the bathroom of a New York diner. Lucas, in a trance state, attacks and <a href="/murder/3015-1654/" data-ref-id="3015-1654">murders</a> a fellow customer. Confused by what has just happened, Lucas flees the scene before his crime is discovered. Soon the diner is investigated by <a href="/detective/3015-1079/" data-ref-id="3015-1079">detectives</a> <a href="/carla-valenti/3005-1473/" data-ref-id="3005-1473">Carla Valenti</a> and <a href="/tyler-miles/3005-2770/" data-ref-id="3005-2770">Tyler Miles</a>. It turns out that Lucas was possessed by <a href="/the-oracle/3005-11117/" data-ref-id="3005-11117">The Oracle</a> looking for Indigo Child. Indigo Child is a little girl with a perfectly pure soul who has never been incarnated, and thus she carries the secrets of life within her soul.</p><p>In order to find the child, The Oracle goes around mind-controlling people and forcing them to kill other people according to an ancient ritual. While the victim is dying, The Oracle is able to peer through "The Snake" and see into the afterlife which lets him look for Indigo Child.</p><p>The Oracle is looking for her and every time he wants a peek he has to arrange for somebody to kill somebody else. Lucas was exposed to a radioactive artifact in a military base when he was growing up, which filled him with The Chroma. The Chroma was dormant in his system for most of his life, only occasionally manifesting itself in the form of clairvoyant visions. After his contact with The Oracle, The Chroma gets stronger and he begins to get super-powers (which resemble The Matrix movies). His powers include <a href="/wall-run/3015-748/" data-ref-id="3015-748">Wall-running</a>, Kung Fu, <a href="/bullet-time/3015-78/" data-ref-id="3015-78">bullet-time</a>, <a href="/super-jump/3015-694/" data-ref-id="3015-694">super jumping</a>, and so forth. The oracle never stops pursuing Lucas at any cost. Throughout the game, Lucas is pursued by these detectives, which leads to the discovery of something more paranormal behind the murder. The detectives begin to notice other murders in the same vein with the same patterns. The story faces Lucas with the responsibility to fight for the safety of the world.</p><p>Meanwhile, the temperature is dropping. At the start of the game, New York is in a period of unusually cold weather, but later the player becomes informed that the whole planet is freezing over in some cataclysm of ice and snow. The change is extremely abrupt.</p><p>Lucas gets a phone call from his ex-girlfriend for a meeting. He then goes to an amusement park to save the life of his girlfriend, who was apparently kidnapped by The Oracle. Turns out this was a trap and Lucas and his ex-girlfriend later fall to their death. But surprisingly, we then see Undead Lucas (dark circles under his eyes, pale, gray hair, wrapped in bandages, and without body heat) team up with Detective Carla, at which point everything we know about her character is thrown out the window as she joins up with a (dead) wanted criminal to help him look for the aforementioned Indigo Child. Carla then falls in love with Lucas.</p><p>Lucas rescues the Indigo Child, and has a huge battle against The Oracle. At the end Lucas runs away, and leaps into an apartment window at random trying to escape from The Oracle. Inside he meets yet another player in the battle for the child, the Purple Clan. The Purple Clan is a glowing yellow sentient AI who are after Indigo Child to capture the world. Lucas is led into the <a href="/sewer/3035-348/" data-ref-id="3035-348">sewers</a> by a new ally - The Invisibles. They're a group that has been fighting against the Orange Clan for thousands of years. Their members are all homeless people. They welcome Carla, Lucas, and the Indigo Child.</p><p>The Indigo Child doesn't speak or act of her own volition. She doesn't act like a kid and nobody ever treats her like one. The Invisibles explain that the Orange Clan is a powerful organization that controls the world banks and governments. Carla and Lucas are later seen making love to each other.</p><p>After that they get in a snowplow and drive Indigo child to the Midwest, where Lucas was originally exposed to The Chroma. Both the Purple Clan and the Orange Clan are waiting when they arrive.</p><p>At this point, based on the player's actions, the Purple Clan, Orange Clan, or human race rule the world.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5322/421071-indigo_prophecy_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-421071" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.62444444444444" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5322/421071-indigo_prophecy_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-421071"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5322/421071-indigo_prophecy_1.jpg" alt="421071-indigo_prophecy_1.jpg"></a></figure><p>The gameplay in <i>Indigo Prophecy</i> focuses on keeping a cinematic feel throughout the game. The game puts a strong focus on <a href="/quick-time-event/3015-6/" data-ref-id="3015-6">quick time events</a> and in-game camera angles - notably, it uses " split screen" to play two separate scenes against one another (for example, a <a href="/police-car/3055-844/" data-ref-id="3055-844">police car</a> on its way to a crime scene and a character at that scene trying to get answers before the police arrive). The most notable gameplay aspect of <i>Indigo</i> is that the face buttons are rarely, if ever, used. Most of the game-play is focused on the right analog stick: the player moves the right analog stick in an approximation of the action to be performed (the available motions are displayed at the bottom of the screen).</p><p>The game does a good job of remembering the players' actions in later story threads. Depending on your actions and what you say in the game, you can affect how things move throughout the plot. For example, in one sequence at the start of the game you have a choice of saving a boy who is drowning in a frozen lake or fleeing from a cop that will likely recognize you. If you save the boy you are recognized by a police officer who was at the diner. If you choose to let the child drown, Lucas' depression deepens.</p><p><i>Indigo Prophecy</i> has a mental health meter. This meter is affected by the actions you make in the world and the things you say when your interacting with characters. Most of the time, major events in the game will decrease your mental health - but you can raise the meter by doing normal daily activities (drinking, washing your hands, listening to music, etc.) When the mental health meter reaches zero, the player will be punished with a game-over screen and must restart from the last checkpoint. While interesting and innovative, Cage remarked that the mental health concept came into the design too late to be integrated significantly into the game's plot.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/390/249983-79747_indigo_prophecy_20050727104818953.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-249983" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.64" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:64.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/390/249983-79747_indigo_prophecy_20050727104818953.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-249983"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Carla at gunpoint." class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/390/249983-79747_indigo_prophecy_20050727104818953.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/390/249983-79747_indigo_prophecy_20050727104818953.jpg" alt="Carla at gunpoint."></noscript></a><figcaption>Carla at gunpoint.</figcaption></figure><p>You play as four different characters: Lucas Kane, Carla Valenti, Tyler Miles and occasionally <a href="/markus-kane/3005-7406/" data-ref-id="3005-7406">Markus Kane</a>. The characters do not necessarily work for the same cause. This is especially present in some scenes - in one scene, the player must create a photo fit of Lucas Kane; depending on how similar the produced image is, later missions as Kane become more difficult.</p><p>The final, and arguably most important, aspect of the gameplay is the dialogue. As with all other interactions, dialogues are performed on the right analog stick where you choose what you want to say by moving it up down left or right. The dialog has many different effects on the plot. Depending on what you say to people, it affects your mental health, with the meter going down if you interact in a negative way and the meter going up if you interact in a positive way. The dialog is also used in some interrogation scenes affecting the kind of information you get from the crime scene depending on what you ask. <i>Indigo Prophecy</i> features three endings.</p><h2>Changes to the North American version</h2><p>In the <a href="/the-united-states-of-america/3035-396/" data-ref-id="3035-396">United States</a> and <a href="/canada/3035-244/" data-ref-id="3035-244">Canada</a>, the game's title was changed from <i>Fahrenheit</i> to <i>Indigo Prophecy</i> to avoid confusion with the documentary movie <i>Fahrenheit 9/11.</i> The <a href="/nudity/3015-1058/" data-ref-id="3015-1058">nude</a> scenes featured in the game were also removed.

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p>Psychonauts is the brain-child of acclaimed developer and adventure game guru <a href="../../tim-schafer/72-2860/" rel="nofollow">Tim Schafer</a>.

When the camp's supervisors realize that Raz has run away from home, they call his parents and tell them to pick him up the next day, but due to the surprising strength of Raz's mind, they allow him to train until his parents arrive.</p><p>His training begins with <a data-ref-id="3035-1342" href="/oleanders-basic-braning/3035-1342/">Coach Oleander's training ground</a>. This war torn mind acts a tutorial level, explaining all the elements (figments, emotional baggage, mental cobwebs and vaults) Raz will encounter during his adventures as a mind traveler.</p><p>After completing Basic Braining, <a data-ref-id="3005-1572" href="/sasha-nein/3005-1572/">Sasha Nein</a> invites Raz to his laboratory for further research. In the lab, Nein tells him he would like to try the Brain Tumbler on Razputin, which is a machine that allows the one who uses it to access the <a data-ref-id="3035-1182" href="/collective-unconscious/3035-1182/">Collective Unconscious</a>, a network of all the minds Raz has entered. From here, Sasha instructs Raz to enter his own mind.</p><p>At first, everything in Raz's mind seems sound, as he sees images of his childhood. Eventually, however, he starts to see things that he doesn't understand, such as meat, steaks, and a curious rabbit, which Nein dismisses as a primal fear or memory. Raz continues along until he finds a shadowy monster that spits a diving helm at him just before Nein pulls him out of the experiment since it is too dangerous for Raz to continue without the right abilities. He's instructed to ask <a data-ref-id="3005-1900" href="/ford-cruller/3005-1900/">Ford Cruller</a> for permission to learn the Psi-Blast ability.</p><p>After receiving clearance, Sasha teaching Raz how to use Psi-Blast. Raz enters Sasha's shooting gallery -- a cube and close representation of how Sasha's mind is like: sparse and organized. Sasha leaves Raz alone to practice his Psi-Blast ability against censors, allowing him to chose how many will pop out at a time. Being a rush to become a Psychonaut, Raz tries to set it to the maximum level, but ends up breaking the machine instead, therefore unleashing chaos on Sasha's mind. After closing all the censor dispensers, a "Mega-Censor" appears due to build-up from all the dispensaries being closed. When Raz defeats it, Sasha gives him the the marksmanship merit badge and prepares to send Raz back into his own mind to face the monster.</p><p>Raz re-enters his psyche, Psi-Blasts the monster's face, and proceeds following the mysterious bunny when he reaches a creepy tower. In it, he sees <a data-ref-id="3005-2035" href="/dogen-boole/3005-2035/">Dogen</a> and what appears to be a blue skinned, psychotic dentist who's set on removing Dogen's brain. Raz tries to reach him, but is unable. Sasha tells him to attend <a data-ref-id="3005-1566" href="/milla-vodello/3005-1566/">Milla Vodello's</a> levitation class in order to save the poor about to be brainless kid.</p><p>He goes to Milla's levitation class, enters Milla's party crazy mind, and finally learns levitation. Before learning it, though, he sees Lilly and they end up discussing the nightmares they've been having that are, coincidentally, extremely similar, and decide to meet that night at the lake. Afterwards, Razputin returns to get his brain tumbled once more.</p><p>He uses his levitation ability to glide thanks the floating powers of rotten meat stench (yes, it's true) and gets inside the tower only to discover that the insane dentist has already removed it with super sneezing powder, which makes anyone who smells it to sneeze and expel his brain. That's how powerful this powder is. But not only that, he also finds <a data-ref-id="3005-947" href="/lili-zanotto/3005-947/">Lili</a>, Raz's love interest, in the same tower. But <a data-ref-id="3005-3673" href="/dr-caligosto-loboto/3005-3673/">Loboto</a> (the dentist) just closed the door behind him. So Raz's only option is to go save Dogen's brain. He goes into the sewer system where Loboto's just thrown the brain only to encounter a psychic tank that picks up Dogen's brain and uses it to work properly. After defeating the psycho tank, Raz ends up in a white room incredibly similar to one that was in Oleander's mind, and discovers the coach's plans to take over the world by building an army of these psychic death tanks that run on human brains. Sasha pulls him out only to tell Raz that he has to go on "official Psychonauts business" without even letting Raz explain what he's just discovered. But the agent has left one crucial item behind, the Psycho-portal, which allows to go into other people's minds. Raz picks it up and continues to explore on his own. But he will eventually have to go to the meeting with Lilly at the lake. They talk about Oleander's plans and how they need to do something about and Lilly does get a bit too excited about it and asks Raz to kiss her, but all this joy is interrupted by the appearance of a giant lungfish who swallows Lili and takes her underwater. Raz follows the lungfish by getting inside a giant diving helm and confronts it and when he finally beats it he learns that the lungfish used to be normal but Dr Loboto and Oleander have transformed it into what it is now. To save Lilly, Raz must get into the mutated lungfish's mind.</p><p>Inside its mind, or <a data-ref-id="3035-1153" href="/lungfishopolis/3035-1153/">Lungfishopolis</a> (because that's the name of the level), Raz will have to free the lungfish resistance who are trying to fight against a mysterious entity known as <a data-ref-id="3005-3676" href="/kochamara/3005-3676/">Kochamara</a> that since it has arrived has been terrifying the poor inhabitants of Lungfishopolis. In this mind Raz is a giant that the lungfish have named Goggalor, and are very hostile towards him. After freeing the resistance, acquiring the Shield ability and reaching the island where Kochamara is emitting his broadcast from a radio tower that the resistance have told Raz to destroy to end Kochamara's reign, Raz fights the other giant which is none other than a projection of coach Oleander that helps him control the giant lungfish's mind. Raz defeats him, destroys the tower and frees Linda (that's the name of the lungfish). After that Raz asks Linda to take him where he left Lilly, and the latter swallows our hero and transports him to the <a data-ref-id="3035-703" href="/thorney-towers/3035-703/">Thorney Towers Home for the Disturbed</a> asylum.</p><p>At the entrance he will find the guard, <a data-ref-id="3005-1276" href="/boyd-cooper/3005-1276/">Boyd</a>, who seems extremely troubled and can't stop rambling things about some milkman. Boyd won't open the door for Raz, so he must help him fight his personal demons. One Psycho-portal to the face later and Raz enters the <a data-ref-id="3035-1133" href="/milkman-conspiracy/3035-1133/">Milkman Conspiracy</a> level. In this level Raz will have to help Boyd find the milkman, since it's the element that seems to bother him so much. Raz obtains the clairvoyance power and discovers that Boyd thinks the Milkman is dead, so Raz goes to the cemetery to check. But first he will have to do a series of errands since agents are heavily guarding the area also looking for the Milkman and all the milk conspirators and won't let him go through certain places if he doesn't have the right item. After obtaining some flowers and passing as a grieving widow, Raz enters the graveyard only to discover that the Milkman is not dead. Exploring a bit further he discovers that the Milkman is guarded by some girls called the Rainbow Squirt and their leader, the Den Mother. Raz fights and defeats the latter and thus freeing the Milkman which actually is Boyd's hidden persona, an arsonist disguised as a milkman who uses milk bottles as Molotov cocktails. The guard/milkman/arsonist opens the doors to the asylum and just stands with a Molotov cocktail in front of the main building, not knowing if he should throw it or not... the worst is yet to come.</p><p>Inside the asylum grounds Raz will have to disguise himself as Dr. Loboto since his sidekick <a data-ref-id="3005-3672" href="/crispin/3005-3672/">Crispin</a> won't let him get to the top. Thankfully he can't see very well and a cheap disguise will do. Raz will need to get a claw-like trophy from <a data-ref-id="3005-3678" href="/gloria-von-gouton/3005-3678/">Gloria Von Gouton</a> the fallen actress, a straitjacket from <a data-ref-id="3005-3679" href="/fred-bonaparte/3005-3679/">Fred Bonaparte</a>, a descendant of Napoleon who thinks he's possessed by his ancestor, and a painting of Dr Loboto from <a data-ref-id="3005-3680" href="/edgar-teglee/3005-3680/">Edgar Teglee</a> the bullfight obsessed artist.</p><p>After helping Gloria fight her personal demons, which in this case are represented as an angry critic who won't let her perform, winning a battle against a mental representation of Napoleon Bonaparte in Fred's mind and helping Edgar Teglee get over his failed relationship with a cheerleader, Raz obtains the three items that will get him to the top of the tower.</p><p>While climbing the tower a strange stalker will follow him, which we discover that it's <a data-ref-id="3005-3674" href="/sheegor/3005-3674/">Sheegor</a>, Dr Loboto's scared assistant. She will agree to help him if he rescues Mister Pokeylope, which is none other than a turtle and Sheegor's weird pet. So Raz rescues Mr Pokeylope, gives it to Sheegor and Pokeylope in his deep, Barry White-esque voice tells us the new plan. Sheegor will have to get Pokeylope's brain out, and with Raz's telekinetic powers he will put it in a machine that enhances Pokeylope's mental powers to blast Dr Loboto. They succeed, recranealize Sasha's and Milla's brains and free Lili. But Oleander comes to crash the party and wants Raz's brain. Ford Cruller comes to join the fight and the Psychonauts leave the kids out of it by picking them up (mentally) and dropping them at the entrance of the asylum.</p><p>Meanwhile, Edgar who feels well and wants to leave the asylum but couldn't because he was chained to a gas pipe, breaks the chains but also the pipe, but it's okay because there's no gas coming out. Until Gloria who wants water to irrigate the flowers accidentally opens the wrong valve, and activates the gas. Boyd realizes he's no longer the Milkman and throws his last Molotov cocktail into the asylum. Like you would have guessed by now, the asylum blows up, the debris almost crushing Raz and Lili who were just kissing, but Raz activated his shield in time. They meet Nein, Vodello and Cruller who seem to have won the battle as they see Oleander completely brainless (Cruller used the sneezing powder on him) but his brain somehow managed to get into a Psychic Tank. The tank blasts the Psychonauts and Lili unconscious, leaving Raz being the only one to dodge it.</p><p>After fighting and beating the tank, Raz goes check it, a terrible mistake because the tank releases some sneezing powder and Raz despite trying not to sneeze expels his brain. Now the only thing he can do is use his telekinesis power to pick himself (or rather his brain) up and put it inside the tank, along with Oleander's brain. This causes the two mind to fuse together and thus creating the last level, the Meat Circus.</p><p>Raz's and Oleander's memories of their childhood are now mixed together and it's up to Raz to undo this mess. Raz will have to help young Oleander save his bunny (that his father, a butcher, killed) through the <a data-ref-id="3035-1814" href="/meat-circus/3035-1814/">Meat Circus</a>. After saving the bunny Raz will fight mental representations of Oleander's father and Raz's father. After doing this, Raz's real father will enter Raz's mind (or rather the mess that is the Meat Circus), revealing that he himself is a psychic, and that he only wanted Raz to be safe from situations like this. The final boss are the two evil visions of Raz and Oleander's respective fathers combined. Raz's real father will give him all his mental power to become some sort of giant Raz that will be able to beat them. He succeeds and the two minds are separated.</p><p>Oleander is finally free from his personal demons and apologizes to everyone who was affected by his evil endeavors, and Raz is awarded for his bravery by becoming an official Psychonaut, but alas, Lili has to return back home. Just when we thought everything was over, the Psychonauts receive a message saying that Lili's father, who turns out to be the leader of the Psychonauts, has been kidnapped. They all go to the mission in a ship and the game ends, hinting at a sequel that may hopefully come one day.</p><h2>Characters</h2><p>The world of Psychonauts is full of many odd, creative characters.</p><table class="t-editor with-border full-width"><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4737/288970-razputin.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-288970" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4737/288970-razputin.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-288970"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4737/288970-razputin.jpg" alt="288970-razputin.jpg"></a></figure></td><td>The main protagonist of the game, Razputin (Raz for short), left his home of the circus to join the <a data-ref-id="3035-187" href="/whispering-rock-psychic-summer-camp/3035-187/">Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp</a>.

Linda gains Raz access to <a data-ref-id="3035-1153" href="/lungfishopolis/3035-1153/">Lungfishopolis</a>.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Gameplay consists of traditional platforming elements combined with puzzles and obstacles that must be thwarted using Raz's ever-increasing arsenal of psychic powers. During the course of his adventures Raz learns new powers, including telekinesis, invisibility, and pyrokinesis. While proper use of these new abilities is necessary for completing the game's main story, Psychonauts allows for more creative uses of Raz's powers on friends and foes alike, often resulting in entertaining results.</p><h3>Collectibles</h3><p>Like any good modern platformer, Psychonauts offers tons of collectibles for the player to get. Certain collectibles will allow Raz to advance in rank which is necessary for him to learn new powers or upgrade them while others are just there to learn a bit more about certain characters and their background or the development process of the game.</p><p>Psi-cards and psi-cores are the first collectibles the player will find. In order to advance one rank the player will need to find nine Psi-cards, combine them with a Psi-core using a machine in Ford Cruller's headquarters that will make Raz advance a whole rank. Nine Psi-cards with a Psi-core is called a Psi Challenge Marker. It's pretty rare to find them in their original form, and reaching them is usually a challenge.</p><p>While exploring other people's minds Raz will collect figments of their imagination. These are pretty common and each one of them have a certain number of points assigned to them. When Raz has collected 100 of these "figment points" he will advance one rank. Raz starts the game at level 1, and the maximum level is 99.</p><p>Emotional baggage in this game is literally what the name says. Crying suitcases, purses, steam trunks and whatnot. To be precise in every mind there is a suitcase, purse, duffle bag, steam trunk and a hatbox that has to be assigned to their respective tags. Once this is done their Primal Memories will be unlocked which is actually art concepts scripts and etc that the developers have used for making the game.</p><p>Raz will also find in all the minds he enters Mental Cobwebs that plague the mental landscape. To retrieve them he will need a cobweb duster and if he brings them to the machine in Cruller's headquarters it will make him progress one rank for each cobweb collected.</p><p>Mental vaults contain memories of the person's mind he's exploring that are important and contain a diaporama explaining a bit of that specific character's background.</p><p>Finally by the last half of the game Raz will have to recuperate his fellow psycadets brains for reasons explained in the plot section. Each brain will give him one mental health point which is represented by a little brain in his health bar.</p><h3>Merit Badges, Psychic Powers and Upgrades</h3><p>Throughout the adventure, Raz will get Merit Badges that allow him to use different psychic powers and get to different areas in the camp. These merit badges he receives will either be given to him for completing a certain level or by obtaining a specific rank.</p><table class="t-editor with-border full-width"><thead><tr><th>Badge / Power</th><th>Description</th><th>Requirements</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Basic Braining</td><td>First badge obtained in the game; allows access into the main campgrounds and surrounding area.</td><td><ul><li>Complete "Coach Oleander's Basic Braining"</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13060/1313118-marksmanship.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1313118" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.84615384615385" data-width="117" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 117px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:84.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13060/1313118-marksmanship.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1313118"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="1313118-marksmanship.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/13060/1313118-marksmanship.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/13060/1313118-marksmanship.jpg" alt="1313118-marksmanship.jpg"></noscript></a></figure></td><td>Unlocks the Psi-Blast ability; as the name implies, this ability allows Raz to fire a power blast of psychic energy.<br /><h4>Upgrades:</h4><ul><li><b><span>Chain Blast</span></b> - Shots bounce off of up to 3 nearby enemies and/or objects. <i><span>(Rank 40)</span></i></li><li><b><span>Super Chain Blast</span></b> - Shots bounce off of up to 6 nearby enemies and/or objects. <i><span>(Rank 70)</span></i></li><li><b><span>Infinite Ammo</span></b> <i><span>(Rank 95)</span></i></li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Defeat the Mega-Censor in "Sasha's Shooting Gallery."</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Oarsman</td><td>Allows Raz to use the canoe at the lake; required to attend Milla's levitation class.</td><td><ul><li>Complete the second part of "Brain Tumbler Experiment."</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13060/1313431-levitation.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1313431" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.84615384615385" data-width="117" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 117px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:84.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13060/1313431-levitation.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1313431"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="1313431-levitation.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/13060/1313431-levitation.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/13060/1313431-levitation.jpg" alt="1313431-levitation.jpg"></noscript></a></figure></td><td>Unlocks the levitation ability, allowing Raz to roll around on a psychic ball, jump onto farther/higher surfaces, as well as float and glide.<br /><br />Upgrades:<br /><ul><li><b><span>Wrecking Ball</span></b> - Energy ball does damage to enemies while moving at full speed. <i><span>(Rank 50)</span></i></li><li><b><span>Rolling Havoc</span></b> - Energy ball does damage to enemies at all times. <i><span>(Rank 75)</span></i></li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Complete "Milla's Dance Party."</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13060/1316172-shield.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1316172" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.81512605042017" data-width="119" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 119px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:81.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13060/1316172-shield.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1316172"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="1316172-shield.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/13060/1316172-shield.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/13060/1316172-shield.jpg" alt="1316172-shield.jpg"></noscript></a></figure></td><td>Protects Raz from all enemy attacks for a short period, though prevents him from moving ahead.<br /><br /><b><span>Upgrades</span></b>:<br /><ul><li><b><span>Offensive Shield</span></b> - Enemy projectiles bounce off of shield.

The characters look more like Tim Burton creations than <a data-ref-id="3005-368" href="/crash-bandicoot/3005-368/">Crash Bandicoot</a> clones, having a hand-drawn, hand-sculpted look to them.</p><p>Each mind the player enters has its own unique look tailored to the personality and problems of its owner. The environments range from topsy-turvy suburbs, to miniaturized cityscapes, to circuses made of meat.</p><p>Scott Campbell, Razmig Mavlian, and Nathan Stapley heavily-influenced the visual design of the game.</p><h2>Critical Acclaim, Commercial Failure</h2><p>Psychonauts' melding of strong storytelling and creative level design won it praise among critics, but failed to move copies off store shelves. Tim Shafer estimated that the game had sold 400,000 units across all 4 platforms. The units sold only refer to physical (disc) copies of the game sold at retailers, and not copies sold through digital distribution services or the store at the Double Fine website. It's unknown if and how much of the digital sales Double Fine receives. Often jokingly Schafer has stated if gamers wish to support Double Fine because they enjoyed Psychonauts they should pirate the game and then buy a t-shirt on their website.</p><p>This commercial failure, combined with the failure of the big-budget <a data-ref-id="3030-9290" href="/advent-rising/3030-9290/">Advent Rising</a>, resulted in the near-bankruptcy of <a data-ref-id="3010-370" href="/majesco-entertainment/3010-370/">Majesco</a> publisher of Psychonauts.</p><h2>Trivia</h2><p>-Coach Oleander's speech can be re-enacted by Raz in game by going to the camp's welcoming area, standing on the tree stump and using the interaction button.</p><p>-<a data-ref-id="3005-3675" href="/mr-pokeylope/3005-3675/">Mr. Pokeylope</a> can be brought back to the camp and shown to each of

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p>Gradius II is Konami's sequel to <a href="/gradius/3030-15508/" data-ref-id="3030-15508">Gradius</a>, and shares its predecessor's basic set-up: The player controls an upgradeable ship named the <a href="/vic-viper/3055-71/" data-ref-id="3055-71">Vic Viper</a> as it flies horizontally across a series of enemy-infested terrains, fighting enormous bosses at the end of each stage. The upgrade system has been slightly tweaked, the graphics updated and the levels are completely different, but is otherwise the same Gradius experience.</p><p>Among the new additions are the load-out screen, from which the player can choose four distinct weapon load-outs for the Vic Viper that they can experiment with to find the one that best suits their play style. The game also has more boss variety than the first, though some bosses are carried over from <a href="/life-force/3030-13960/" data-ref-id="3030-13960">Salamander</a>/<a href="/life-force/3030-13960/" data-ref-id="3030-13960">Life Force</a>, an interim Konami shooter that was heavily inspired by the first Gradius.</p><p>Though neither the Arcade version or the original NES home version ever made it to the US (the Arcade version was released in Europe as Vulcan Venture), the NES version would eventually make its way to the US Wii Shop's Virtual Console almost 20 years later.</p><p>The MSX/X68000 game, Nemesis 2 (Gradius 2), is a completely different game in every sense.</p>]]></description>

      <deck><![CDATA[Star Wars: Jedi Starfighter is an arcade style air combat game, featuring a nimble Jedi starfighter with force powers, and a high tech bomber.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Plot</h2><p>Star Wars: Jedi Starfighter takes place both before and during the events of Episode II. In the game <a href="/adi-gallia/3005-6397/" data-ref-id="3005-6397"> Adi Gallia</a> is tasked with testing out the new <a href="/jedi-starfighter/3055-1312/" data-ref-id="3055-1312"> Jedi Starfighter</a>, and investigating suspicious activity of the Trade Federation and the Separatists Movement. During her mission, she meets up with Nym, a returning character form the first game. Nym is a space pirate, forced off of his base by the Trade Federation, along with his crew. Having similar goals, they join up together and investigate the mysterious activity in the system. Eventually they split up after having a disagreement; Gallia wanted to focus on her mission, while Nym was more concerned with finding a new home. However when Gallia is facing defeat during the final battle, Nym and his men arrive and save the day.</p><p> </p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Being an arcade style game, Star Wars: Jedi Starfighter was very much about taking on large groups of enemies, assaulting large ships, and navigating the environment. Ammo was unlimited, shields recharged, and special abilities operated on a cool down, which all contributed to much less serious gameplay experience. The game also allowed you to issue commands to your wing mates,</p><p> </p><p>Missions very broken down into both primary and secondary objectives. Players could earn bonuses for completing these bonus objectives, which gave them a bronze, silver, or gold ranking at the end of the mission. The mission types were varied, including assaulting targets, aerial dog-fighting, <a href="/escort-mission/3015-227/" data-ref-id="3015-227"> escorting</a> other ships, and defending locations.</p><p> </p><h2>Ships</h2><p>Unlike the <a href="/star-wars-starfighter/3030-13998/" data-ref-id="3030-13998"> original game</a>, Jedi Starfigher only had two playable characters with a single ship each. The Jedi Adi Gallia flew a new experimental Jedi Starfighter, which was designed to both be a nimble and powerful ship, but also to focus the Jedi pilot's force abilities to work with the ship. Some of these abilities were a force shield that could both absorb and reflect enemy fire, force lightening that would chain between nearby ships, the ability to concentrate and <a href="/bullet-time/3015-78/" data-ref-id="3015-78"> slowdown time</a>, and the ability to launch a devastating shockwave out from the ship. Returning character Nym still flies his heavy armed fighter/bomber The Havoc, although it has some new abilites since the last game, including guided missiles, and smart bombs. The game also features several <a href="/unlockables/3015-1414/" data-ref-id="3015-1414"> unlockable</a> ships, including <a href="/boba-fett/3005-1669/" data-ref-id="3005-1669"> Boba Fett</a>'s ship Slave I, and the precusor to the X-Wing, the Z-95 Headhunter.</p><p> </p><h2>Development - Behind the Scenes</h2><p>Prior to the games release as the game was being readied for submission to Sony there existed a bug in which the PlayStation 2 controller’s analog stick functionality would shut off while the game was loading the post-mission cutscenes which in turn would cause the the red light in the center of the controller to turn off as well.</p><p>Such a bug was a TCR bug (Technical Certification Requirement) which are a set of standards determined by the platform holder to ensure the game works within the constraints of the particular platform and can be thought of as the standards which a game must meet in order to be released on a given platform.</p><p>The programmer responsible for this particular aspect of the development (the movie-loading code and the input / output logic for the controller itself) had left the company several mid-development and so the task of fixing the problem was left to the remaining developers on the team.</p><p>One developer (<a href="/brett-douville/3040-38884/" data-ref-id="3040-38884">Brett Douville</a>) was tasked with fixing the bug and in hope of narrowing down the problem inserted seven screen clears of different colours into the code to help determine the potential source of the problem. The reasoning was to narrow down the potentially problematic sections of code by checking what colour the screen was when the analog controls turned off but surprisingly all attempts to reproduce the bug failed.</p><p>Now, due to the fact that the submission date to Sony was a mere 2-3 days away and missing the date would have significant consequences rather than find the true source of the problem it was decided to simply change all the screen clears to black (thus being indistinguishable by the player - essentially they were made invisible) and the bug marked as fixed and the game shipped on time.</p>]]></description>

Struggling against a painful case of amnesia, Mercer escapes the morgue in search of his sister, <a href="../../dana-mercer/94-9178/" rel="nofollow">Dana</a>. Working with his sister and other allies, Alex seeks to uncover his powers' origins as well as stop a mysterious viral outbreak that has also appeared on the island.</p><p>Unfortunately, Mercer is hindered by the United States military as well as the merciless <a href="../../blackwatch/92-2367/" rel="nofollow">Blackwatch</a>. These black ops soldiers will stop at nothing to contain the virus and capture Mercer, even if it means destroying everyone and everything in their path. With martial law declared and an iron blockade isolating Manhattan, Alex has no choice but to confront both the <a href="../../the-infected/92-2368/" rel="nofollow">viral monsters</a> and the military forces at every turn, all the while uncovering the terrible secrets concerning the nature of the virus and the nature of his powers.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2891/1062832-prototype_273.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1062832" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2891/1062832-prototype_273.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1062832"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Tanks?

No problem.</figcaption></figure><p>Prototype iterates heavily on Radical Entertainment's 2005 superhero game, <a href="../../the-incredible-hulk-ultimate-destruction/61-19865/" rel="nofollow">The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction</a>, with both sharing a focus on chaos and destruction. Locomotion is also similar, with both games' protagonists capable of running along the facades of skyscrapers and leaping hundreds of feet into the air. Augmenting Alex Mercer's superior running and jumping skills is his ability to " <a href="../../auto-parkour/92-3314/" rel="nofollow">auto parkour</a>". As long as he is running, obstacles in Alex Mercer's path are automatically leaped and flipped over, providing a single, fluid direction of movement regardless of the path taken.</p><p>Prototype also introduces new stealth mechanics where players may literally consume other humans and take their form, using the disguise for both evasion and infiltration. The act of consuming another being also replenishes Mercer's biomass, effectively turning any person into a <a href="../../health-pack/93-255/" rel="nofollow">health boost</a>. In certain points in the game, consuming another being does more than just replenish health. Alex Mercer may also absorb the memories, skills, and even the personality of his victim, allowing Mercer to uncover story elements, gain new skills, and improve existing ones.</p><h2>Powers</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2891/1062607-prototype_164.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1062607" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2891/1062607-prototype_164.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1062607"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Combine the blade and armor powers." class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2891/1062607-prototype_164.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2891/1062607-prototype_164.jpg" alt="Combine the blade and armor powers."></noscript></a><figcaption>Combine the blade and armor powers.</figcaption></figure><p>Alex Mercer possesses a wide variety of abilities, many of which require manual activation by the player. These active powers are separated into categories. At any one time, Alex may simultaneously equip one offensive, defensive, and visual power. His disguise power, however, may only be simultaneously used with visual powers. Intelligent use of these abilities allows the player to conquer any obstacle the game presents.</p><h3>Miscellaneous Powers</h3><ul><li><b>Consume</b> - Alex can absorb the biomass of the humans he kills into his body, replenishing his health. Larger, inhuman enemies may also be partially consumed once weakened. Alex can also absorb the memories of some of the people he consumes; consuming specific targets may improve combat skills or provide insight into various story elements, also known as the "Web of Intrigue".</li><li><b>Regeneration</b> - If Alex is injured and no longer receiving damage, his body will automatically repair itself and slowly regain health.</li><li><b>Strength</b> - With superhuman strength, Alex can punch through armoured tanks and hurl the resulting husks at helicopters.</li><li><b>Speed</b> - Alex can sprint indefinitely through oncoming traffic and straight up the sides of buildings.</li><li><b>Glide</b> - When running isn't the best option, Alex produces invisible filaments extending from his arms and legs, allowing him to glide short distances.</li><li><b>Devastator Abilities</b> - By possessing sufficient biomass, Alex may turn his body into a weapon of even greater destruction, hurling his form as ground spikes, airborne tendrils, or a single pillar of death.</li></ul><h3>Offensive Powers</h3><ul><li><b>Claws</b> - Each of Alex's fingers becomes a vicious claw. Although significantly more powerful than his fists, these weapons are still relatively weak in melee. However, they grant Alex the ability to send his claws underground, erupting violently underneath an opponent.</li><li><b>Hammerfists</b> - Alex shifts a great deal of biomass into his hands, transforming them into enormous bludgeons with which he can smash through the protection of armored targets or even turn himself into a human projectile.</li><li><b>Whipfist</b> - Alex's right arms transforms into an elastic, whip-like tendril with a terminal hook. The Whipfist is best used on multiple or distant opponents as well as latching onto distant obstacles and pulling them closer. Especially useful is its ability to latch onto helicopters to let Alex get close enough to steal them.</li><li><b>Musclemass</b> - Alex focuses his biomass into both his arms, drastically increasing his strength. While he no longer has access to special moves associated with other offensive powers, Alex's traditional combos and thrown objects now deal increased damage.</li><li><b>Blade</b> - One of the signature abilities. Alex's right arm transforms into a single elongated blade, deadly against both armoured and unarmoured opponents. Despite its shape, Alex is still able to grab and pick up people with it... somehow.</li></ul><h3>Defensive Powers</h3><ul><li><b>Shield</b> - Alex's left arm grows into a shield which extends to cover his front while he runs or locks onto a target, protecting him from damage. However, it can shatter if given enough punishment. It regenerates over time. It also disables his parkour abilities, in favour of holding the shield in front of him and smashing straight through obstacles.</li><li><b>Armour Form</b> - Alex's entire body becomes encased in an incredibly durable armour skin, reducing all received damage. Such increased mass, however, decreases Alex's mobility. He can no longer parkour or glide and his jumping ability is greatly diminished.</li></ul><h3>Sensory Powers</h3><ul><li><b>Thermal Vision</b> - Alex's visual senses attune to the infrared band, allowing him to more easily spot heat signatures through fog and smoke. Drawbacks include reduced visual range and a decrease in auditory feedback.</li><li><b>Infected Vision</b> - By connecting his mind to the viral hive mind that guides the infected, Alex sees the world as his enemy sees. Enemies become more brightly illuminated, and line of sight is no longer reduced. Auditory senses, however, are decreased to only a low rumbling at all times.</li></ul><h3>Disguise Abilities</h3><ul><li><b>Disguise</b> - Alex <a href="../../shape-shifting/92-570/" rel="nofollow">shapeshifts</a> into the form of the last healthy human he consumed (he cannot take the form of the Infected). Doing so has many applications, chiefly evading pursuers and using the shape of military personnel to infiltrate fortified military installations. If no alarm has been raised, Alex may even silently hijack vehicles without breaking cover.</li><li><b>Stealth Consume</b> - If no military personnel are watching, Alex may consume and take the form of an individual in one fluid motion without raising an alarm.</li><li><b>Patsy</b> - Only available while in military disguise, Alex accuses another soldier of being Alex Mercer, somehow instantly convincing surrounding allies to open fire on the luckless individual. This initially requires close contact with the victim, but can be upgraded to a simple point.</li><li><b>Air Strike</b> - Again only available in military disguise, Alex can radio in air support. Alex can only make so many calls, however, before he must consume a military commander to inexplicably restock the ability's uses.</li></ul><h3>Vehicular Skills</h3><ul><li><b>Jack Helicopters</b> - Once Alex has consumed a helicopter pilot, he can steal choppers from their pilots by leaping onto them as they are flying through the air. He can then fly around freely and use the copter's full arsenal against his enemies.</li><li><b>Jack Armour</b> - Once Alex has consumed a tank driver, he can steal <a href="../../tank/93-92/" rel="nofollow">tanks</a> and <a href="../../armored-personnel-carrier/93-645/" rel="nofollow">APCs</a> by jumping onto them, wrenching open the lid and killing everybody inside. After that, he can freely ride around and he obtains full access to the tank's variety of guns and cannons.</li></ul><h3><b>Devastator</b></h3><p>Devastator attacks can only be performed when Alex is in 'Critical Mass'. In order to reach Critical Mass, Alex must consume enough humans or infected to overfill his health bar. The Devastator attack will relieve Alex of this over burden of health, and the results are usually worth it. Each of the devastator attacks has an Air version, purchased separately, that can be executed while jumping or falling.</p><ul><li><b>Groundspike Graveyard</b> - A massive area of effect attack of spikes piercing out of the ground</li><li><b>Tendril Barrage</b> - Alex becomes the center point for a large explosions of tendrils that damage everything they touch.</li><li><b>Critical Pain</b> - The only devastator which is a directed attack; appears to be a horizontal tornado coming out of Alex.</li></ul><h2>PC System Requirements</h2><ul><li><b>OS:</b> Windows® XP (with Service Pack 3) or Windows Vista®</li><li><b>Processor:</b> Intel® Core™2 Duo 2.6 GHz or AMD Athlon™ 64 X2 4000 or better</li><li><b>Memory:</b> Vista 2 GB RAM / XP 1 GB RAM</li><li><b>Graphics:</b> All NVIDIA® GeForce® 7800 GT 256 MB and better chipsets. All ATI Radeon™ X1800 256 MB and better chipsets <b>DirectX®:</b> Microsoft DirectX 9.0c</li><li><b>Hard Drive:</b> 8GB of free hard drive space</li><li><b>Sound:</b> DirectX® 9.0c compliant sound card</li></ul><h2>Xbox 360 Install</h2><p>Prototype requires 6.8 gigabytes of free space on your Xbox 360 HDD. Installing the game will greatly decrease load times.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p>Maniac Mansion: Day of the Tentacle is a sequel to the 1988 <a href="/maniac-mansion/3030-2037/" data-ref-id="3030-2037">Maniac Mansion</a>, it was designed by industry veterans <a href="/tim-schafer/3040-2860/" data-ref-id="3040-2860">Tim Schafer</a> and <a href="/dave-grossman/3040-89595/" data-ref-id="3040-89595">Dave Grossman.</a> Originally released in June 1993, Day of the Tentacle gathered lasting critical acclaim primarily for its humour and visual style.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1156/358778-961960549_00.gif" data-ref-id="1300-358778" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1156/358778-961960549_00.gif" data-ref-id="1300-358778"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1156/358778-961960549_00.gif" alt="Hancock, Jefferson, Washington, and Hoagie."></a><figcaption>Hancock, Jefferson, Washington, and Hoagie.</figcaption></figure><p>Day of the Tentacle was one of the first games to feature a puzzle structure based on time travel and alternating characters. In order to solve puzzles it may be required to exchange items with characters in different time periods in order to solve puzzles. For example, the player must freeze a present day hamster in order to retrieve and revive it in the future to power a machine.</p><p>As in other post Loom LucasArts adventure games it is impossible for the player to die or get into an unsolvable solution.

In order to save the world Bernard, Laverne, and Hoagie must interchange items and find the parts to fix the time machine in order to return to the present time and stop Purple Tentacle.</p><h2>Miscellanea</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/106635/2281862-day_of_tentacle_triangle_box.png" data-ref-id="1300-2281862" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.0340909090909" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:103.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/106635/2281862-day_of_tentacle_triangle_box.png" data-ref-id="1300-2281862"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="The game's triangular prism—shaped box." class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/10/106635/2281862-day_of_tentacle_triangle_box.png"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/10/106635/2281862-day_of_tentacle_triangle_box.png" alt="The game's triangular prism—shaped box."></noscript></a><figcaption>The game's triangular prism—shaped box.</figcaption></figure><ul><li>In the SNES and Genesis game <a href="/zombies-ate-my-neighbors/3030-16116/" data-ref-id="3030-16116">Zombies Ate My Neighbors</a> a level titled "Day of the Tentacle" can be unlocked with a password as a bonus level.

The game is a side scrolling beat-em-up, in which players can fight enemies across a four stages: an airport, lumberhouse, a field, and the base of operations for the Black Warriors. The largest differences between the original Double Dragon and Double Dragon II are improved moves, range of attack, and control scheme. In Double Dragon, players could either kick or punch. Double Dragon II changes this, and opts instead for directional based attacks (e.g. if the player is facing to the right, one button will send out a flurry of punches and the other button will have the character kick from the back).</p><p>In addition to friendly characters, all of the enemies have received significant makeovers as well. As well as a range of new enemy characters (including the final boss, Willy, leader of the Black Warriors), enemies now have new weapons to carry around and use, including shovels and hand grenades. Enemy attacks are also modified, including a new range of combos and special attacks (to combat the new moves that Jimmy and Billy have received, such as the Hurricane Kick).</p><h3>NES Version</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3401/392476-dd2021.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-392476" data-size="small" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.9375" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:93.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3401/392476-dd2021.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-392476"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt=" The only way to get the true ending in the NES version is to play the game on hard." class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3401/392476-dd2021.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3401/392476-dd2021.jpg" alt=" The only way to get the true ending in the NES version is to play the game on hard."></noscript></a><figcaption> The only way to get the true ending in the NES version is to play the game on hard.</figcaption></figure><p>Possibly the most well known version of Double Dragon II: The Revenge, the NES version was originally released on December 23, 1989 in Japan, and then later released in North America during January of 1990. Published by <a href="/acclaim-entertainment-inc/3010-88/" data-ref-id="3010-88">Acclaim Entertainment</a> and developed by <a href="/technos-japan-corp/3010-452/" data-ref-id="3010-452">Technos</a>, Double Dragon II for the NES is very different from the arcade version on which it is based. Similar to the previous NES game, Double Dragon, this NES game is a one to two player side scrolling beat-em-up, although this was the first version of a Double Dragon game on the NES that could be played by two players simultaneously in co-op. The game has an expanded story, including cutscenes before each stage (of which there are nine). In addition, there is a separate final boss in the NES version, which can only be fought on the hardest difficult level. Upon being defeated, Marian is brought back to life (unlike the arcade version).</p><p>The Lee brothers retain the bi-directional attacks from the arcade version (with B and A on the NES pad corresponding to Left and Right attacks, respectively) as well as the spinning Hurricane Kick special move. In addition, they can execute "hyper" uppercut and "hyper" flying knee attacks, which send enemies flying skyward and backwards, respectively. The latter move is particularly useful for making quick work of enemies (including boss characters) when fighting near a bottomless pit area. While the Hurricane Kick can be executed on the fly by jumping and then tapping both buttons at the peak of the jump, the latter two must be executed by timing button presses almost perfectly when the player character is just exiting his kneeling frame of animation (initiated by either landing from a jump or getting up from a fall), making them slightly more complex moves to pull off.</p><p>Stage design (as well as several new stages with story sequences playing out before each one), modes, and the plot changes are all among the differences between the arcade and NES versions of Double Dragon II. Arguably the largest change is the addition of a two-player "Mode B", where the players can damage each other during the game - this factor was subsequently used to discover a number of exploits and shortcuts by the <a href="/speedrun/3015-179/" data-ref-id="3015-179">speedrun</a> community. (Another side effect of "Mode B" was that if one player killed another, the first player would gain the life that the other player lost, something that could be used to give a single player up to 7 lives.) Additionally, Double Dragon II on the NES adds five new stages, differing enemies, radically different stage design, and a new final boss (named the Mysterious Warrior).</p><h3>Other Versions</h3><p>Other than the well-known arcade and NES versions, there have been a variety of other ports of Double Dragon II: The Revenge. Two other home console ports were produced in 1991 and 1993 (both exclusively in Japan) for the <a href="/sega/3010-62/" data-ref-id="3010-62">Sega</a> Mega Drive and the PC Engine respectively. The Mega Drive version is largely unchanged from the arcade game, only slightly altering the second stage. The PC Engine version featured upgraded graphics (including the story sequences from the NES version, which are redone for this version), new music, slightly altered stage design, and voice acting for the main characters, including Billy, Jimmy, and Marian.</p><p>Several ports were released for PC platforms as well, with <a href="/virgin-mastertronic-ltd/3010-171/" data-ref-id="3010-171">Virgin Mastertronic</a> and <a href="/binary-design-ltd/3010-496/" data-ref-id="3010-496">Binary Design</a> handling ports to the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, IBM PC, Commodore Amiga, Amstrad CPC, and Atari ST in 1989. These companies were the same companies to handle the PC ports of the original Double Dragon as well.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1317956-1162_809582.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1317956" data-size="small" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.98591549295775" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:98.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1317956-1162_809582.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1317956"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt=" Double Dragon II's arranged soundtrack" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1317956-1162_809582.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1317956-1162_809582.jpg" alt=" Double Dragon II's arranged soundtrack"></noscript></a><figcaption> Double Dragon II's arranged soundtrack</figcaption></figure><ol><li>Dead or Alive (2:48)</li><li>The Vengeful Demon has Begun to Move (3:37)</li><li>A Quiet Pursuit (3:01)</li><li>Tension at the Night Sky (1:43)</li><li>Advancing Towards Sunset (2:25)</li><li>Escape to the Forest (3:43)</li><li>Wicked God (1:25)</li><li>Breaking the Barrier (2:37)</li><li>Enter to the Enemy's Base (3:19)</li><li>Roar of the Twin Dragons (3:55)</li><li>Miracle of the Twin Dragons (1:25)</li><li>Sweet Memories (3:13)</li></ol>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<br />Wild Arms 3 is an  RPG with traditional Japanese Role Playing staples. A hand drawn art style with the expected wide eyed anime characters,  on a quest to save the world from certain destruction. The story again takes place in the world of Filgaia, the old west themed universe of the previous two games. Virgina Maxwell and her three compatriots Gallows Carradine, a Native seeking a life outside his village and expected preisthood. Clive Winslett, a bounty hunter trying to provide for his family, and Jet Enduro an amnesiac looking to peice together his past. All traveling the vast desert wastelands that have overtaken the land looking for a way to return the once lush planet to it former glory.<br /><br />When traveling the over world as in previous Wild Arms your destination won't be apparent, having you to actively search for the town,dungeon,tower etc... needed to continue the story. Encounters happen at random however you may cancel the encounter with a timed button press, You can only do so a set number of times as this is attached to a points meter which will deplete quickly. It is also possible for your party members to be caught alone in a fight, having to wait several turns for their comrades to appear in battle adding danger and potential for death from any small encounter. The battle system is the expected turn based system however the action on screen takes your characters out of rank and file order letting them circle and move amongst the enemies. While in combat your special attacks summons and magical attacks are governed by "Force Points", costing a certain amount each time you use said skill. Basic attacking also gets a twist having to reload your weapon after so many shots injecting strategy when combining fire with partners. While not ruining anything healing items are handled in a unique way in this game as well.<br /><br />Wild Arms has a beautiful score from the Composer on the original Wild Arms and it's sequel, anime sequences round out and tie in the visuals throughout the game. Wild Arms 3 is a terrific game that mixes the same stale JRPG genre just enough so both hardcore, and new-age role players alike should find something to enjoy.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The gameplay in Wonder Boy is traditional platforming fare, tasking players with navigating their way to the end of each level which would entail correctly timing jumps and either defeating enemies using throwing axes or avoiding them entirely. Wonder Boy can collect items, such as fruit, which were scattered throughout the levels to increase their score. Whilst Wonder Boy begins his journey on foot, players could often navigate them on via a skateboard, should the correct item be collected.</p><p><a href="//www.giantbomb.com/adventure-island/3030-1502/" data-ref-id="3030-1502">Adventure Island</a> and Wonder Boy share the same engine and are essentially the same game, with minor differences. Each of these games would spin out into their own completely separate franchises.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p>Manhunt is a <a href="/controversy/3015-506/" data-ref-id="3015-506">controversial</a> action- <a href="/stealth/3015-24/" data-ref-id="3015-24">stealth</a> game released for <a href="/xbox/3045-32/" data-ref-id="3045-32">Xbox</a>, <a href="/playstation-2/3045-19/" data-ref-id="3045-19">Playstation 2</a>, and <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC</a> on November 18, 2003. The player controls the <a href="/convict/3015-3773/" data-ref-id="3015-3773">inmate</a> <a href="/james-earl-cash/3005-1901/" data-ref-id="3005-1901">James Earl Cash</a> as he tries to <a href="/survival/3015-1297/" data-ref-id="3015-1297">survive</a> in a <a href="/city/3035-2093/" data-ref-id="3035-2093">city</a> filled with <a href="/gangs/3015-1397/" data-ref-id="3015-1397">gangs</a> who want to kill him. The game received generally favorable reviews at launch and sold well. Because of the game's <a href="/extreme-violence/3015-1042/" data-ref-id="3015-1042">very graphic violence</a>, it received heavy media attention and was linked to a murder case in the <a href="/united-kingdom/3035-492/" data-ref-id="3035-492">UK</a>, although the <a href="/police/3015-1011/" data-ref-id="3015-1011">police</a> found no <a href="/evidence/3015-3042/" data-ref-id="3015-3042">evidence</a> of the game's involvement. The game is currently <a href="/banned/3015-826/" data-ref-id="3015-826">banned</a> in several countries, including <a href="/australia/3035-292/" data-ref-id="3035-292">Australia</a>.</p><p>A 1080p version of the game with added trophy support was released on PS4 on March 22nd, 2016.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The gameplay is primarily <a href="/third-person-perspective/3015-464/" data-ref-id="3015-464">third-person</a> stealth action. Throughout the game there are different objects, such as <a href="/baseball-bat/3055-39/" data-ref-id="3055-39">baseball bats</a> and <a href="/plastic-bag/3055-4524/" data-ref-id="3055-4524">plastic bags</a>, which can be used to execute gang members. There are three different "levels" of <a href="/execution/3015-1546/" data-ref-id="3015-1546">executions</a>. Level 1 is quick and not very gory, with the gore and over the top nature of the executions going up with each level. While direct confrontation is possible, it is generally preferable to run and hide in <a href="/shadow/3015-1810/" data-ref-id="3015-1810">shadows</a>, and wait until the Hunters tire and walk away. Later in the game <a href="/gun/3055-118/" data-ref-id="3055-118">firearms</a> are acquired, and the gameplay starts focusing less on stealth and more on shooting.</p><p>The game also has a grading system that gives the player a rank at the end of each mission. Only by playing the "hardcore" <a href="/difficulty-level/3015-183/" data-ref-id="3015-183">difficulty setting</a> can a player obtain the <a href="/cheat-code/3015-237/" data-ref-id="3015-237">cheat codes</a> hidden in the extras. You gain a <a href="/star/3055-1818/" data-ref-id="3055-1818">star</a> by beating the level under <a href="/par-time/3015-3992/" data-ref-id="3015-3992">par time</a> and by doing the most gruesome killings you can. This amounts to pulling off as many red grade executions as you can and for the gun orientated missions; getting as many point-blank <a href="/headshot/3015-85/" data-ref-id="3015-85">headshots</a> as possible with a <a href="/shotgun/3055-114/" data-ref-id="3055-114">shotgun</a>. Playing on the "fetish" setting will enable you to earn up to 3 stars depending on your executions and playing on "hardcore" raises this limit to 4. By getting 5 stars on all missions the player will unlock every cheat code available. However, in order to keep the cheats the final mission must also be the last mission a player five stars', otherwise the data cannot be saved.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p>The game starts with a <a href="/journalist/3015-2444/" data-ref-id="3015-2444">journalist</a> reporting on the inmate James Earl Cash who is about to be executed by lethal injection. However Cash is later awoken by an unknown voice who tells him the injection was only a sedative, and that Cash has to do as the voice says. The voice identifies himself as "The Director" and promises Cash his <a href="/freedom/3015-4598/" data-ref-id="3015-4598">freedom</a>, if he slaughters the gang members, called Hunters, on the <a href="/street/3035-3487/" data-ref-id="3035-3487">streets</a> of <a href="/carcer-city/3035-28/" data-ref-id="3035-28">Carcer City</a>. The Director directs Cash through an <a href="/headset/3055-3669/" data-ref-id="3055-3669">earpiece</a>, and records the gruesome murders Cash commits through <a href="/surveillance-camera/3055-898/" data-ref-id="3055-898">hidden security cameras</a>.</p><h2>Levels</h2><ul><li>Born Again</li><li>Doorway into Hell</li><li>Road to Ruin</li><li>White Trash</li><li>Fuelled by Hate</li><li>Grounds for Assault</li><li>Strapped for Ca$h</li><li>View of Innocence</li><li>Drunk Driving</li><li>Graveyard Shift</li><li>Mouth of Madness</li><li>Doing Time</li><li>Kill the Rabbit</li><li>Divided They Fall</li><li>Press Coverage</li><li>Wrong Side of the Tracks</li><li>Trained to Kill</li><li>Border Patrol</li><li>Key Personnel</li><li>Deliverance</li></ul><h2>Snuff</h2><p>The main theme of the game is a phenomenon called snuff films. The concept of snuff films are as follows: a person gets in front of a camera and gets <a href="/rape/3015-2992/" data-ref-id="3015-2992">raped</a>, <a href="/torture/3015-2574/" data-ref-id="3015-2574">tortured</a> and/or <a href="/murder/3015-1654/" data-ref-id="3015-1654">killed</a> for the sake of the video. This last part is important because footage of accidents or <a href="/decapitation/3015-1452/" data-ref-id="3015-1452">beheadings</a> and such do not fall under the category snuff because these acts are not filmed for the purpose of entertainment. The enemies in the game are the victims to your executions, which make up the snuff films.</p><p>Even though a lot of people have heard of snuff films it has never been proven that bona fide snuff films actually exist. There have been several cases where people thought they were dealing with snuff, like with the movie series "Guinea Pig", but they all ended up being fake.</p><h2>PC System Requirements</h2><h3>Minimum System Configuration</h3><ul><li>Processor : 1 GHz Intel Pentium III or AMD Athlon processor or equivalent</li><li>RAM : 192 MB</li><li>GPU : 32 MB</li><li>Hard Drive : 2300 MB</li><li>Other : 32 MB video card with DirectX 8.1 compatible drivers</li></ul><h3>Recommended System Configuration</h3><ul><li>Processor : Intel Pentium 4 or AMD Athlon XP processor (or better) or equivalent</li><li>RAM : 256 MB</li><li>GPU : 32 MB</li><li>Hard Drive : 2300 MB</li><li>Other : Gamepad, DirectX 8.1 compatible sound card with hardware positional sound</li></ul>]]></description>

      <deck><![CDATA[The fifth game of the Twisted Metal franchise. It occurs outside of the "normal" continuity and has a much darker tone than the previous games.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p>Twisted Metal Black was a launch title for the <a href="/playstation-2/3045-19/" data-ref-id="3045-19">PlayStation 2</a>. The tone of the game differs greatly from the previous games, with it opting for a much darker and 'twisted' style of storytelling. Every character is an inmate at Blackfield Asylum, and is visited by the mysterious <a href="/calypso/3005-2556/" data-ref-id="3005-2556">Calypso</a> who promises to give them anything they want if they win his sadistic tournament.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p>The game follows the Twisted Metal tournament in which 15 psychotic mental patients from Blackfield Asylum compete to have any one of their wishes granted.</p><p>In Twisted Metal: Black, each of the involved characters has their own back story is narrated from their own perspective. Each of the stories begins with a visit from Calypso - the tournament's creator. Calypso is aware of these peoples' desires, and offers it to them through his contest. The characters include murderers, cannibal war veterans, psychotic brides, <a href="/sweet-tooth/3005-415/" data-ref-id="3005-415">Sweet Tooth</a>, and many more, as listed below.</p><p>Mid-point cutscenes reveal more about each of the characters individually, as well as text during loading screens.</p><p>Completing the game with every character, including unlockable characters, unlocks Minion. Minion is somewhat different from the rest of the cast in that his loading screen text is in code. By following the logic of 1=A, 2=B, 3=C, etc, the following is revealed:</p><blockquote><p>I do not think this is real.</p><p>I must speak in code or he will discover me.</p><p>We are trapped in his head.</p><p>This is how he sees the world, how Sweet Tooth sees his life. It is not real.</p><p>All of us are trapped in his head.</p><p>I miss the old colorful world.</p><p>We will return to our world one day.</p><p>In the real world my name is Marcus Kane.</p></blockquote><p>Further evidence that the game takes place within Sweet Tooth's head is visible from the start. He's the only base character to be listed in the middle of the unlockable characters. His driver bio has him listed as extremely dangerous, something no other driver is. The entire game serves to inflate his ego.</p><h2>Characters</h2><h3>Sweet Tooth</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/110/223985-sweettooth_stalking.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-223985" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="1.1441441441441" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:114.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/110/223985-sweettooth_stalking.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-223985"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/110/223985-sweettooth_stalking.jpg" alt="223985-sweettooth_stalking.jpg"></a></figure><p><a href="/sweet-tooth/3005-415/" data-ref-id="3005-415">Sweet Tooth</a> is a psychopathic serial killer who wants nothing more than to kill. His voice over speaks with great pride about his numerous killings, even talking about them on the loading screens. He is a heavyset man wearing a clown mask and suspenders with dirty pants and work boots. His murder weapon of choice is a knife. After being captured, killing several police officers in the process, he is cursed by a priest with a flaming head and eternal agony. His wish is for the removal of the curse. Several of the other drivers are linked to Sweet Tooth in various ways.</p><ul><li>Vehicle: <a href="/ice-cream-truck/3055-1910/" data-ref-id="3055-1910">Ice cream truck</a></li><li>Disorder: Unspecified Psychotic disorder; Homicidal tendencies; Insomnia.</li></ul><h3> </h3><h3>Dollface (aka Darkside)</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/16944/2130482-dollface2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2130482" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="1.2736486486486" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:127.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/16944/2130482-dollface2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2130482"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/16944/2130482-dollface2.jpg" alt="2130482-dollface2.jpg"></a></figure><p><a href="/dollface/3005-8448/" data-ref-id="3005-8448">Dollface</a> is a sweet, introverted girl who went to work for a mask maker as a part-time job.

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p>The first appearance of the <a href="/devil-may-cry/3025-147/" data-ref-id="3025-147">Devil May Cry</a> series on the 360 &amp; PS3 console hardware, Devil May Cry 4 once again let players step into the shoes of the demonic demon hunter <a href="/dante/3005-309/" data-ref-id="3005-309">Dante</a>, as well as series newcomer (and Dante lookalike) <a href="/nero/3005-662/" data-ref-id="3005-662">Nero</a>. This is the first entry of the franchise to appear on a <a href="/microsoft-game-studios/3010-340/" data-ref-id="3010-340">Microsoft</a> console (excluding the <a href="/devil-may-cry-3-dantes-awakening/3030-890/" data-ref-id="3030-890">DMC3</a> <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC</a> port). Devil May Cry 4 adds some small changes to the formula used in the last game, but doesn't stray far from its predecessors.</p><p><a href="/devil-may-cry-4-special-edition/3030-48439/" data-ref-id="3030-48439">Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition</a>, an enhanced port with additional playable characters and other new features, was released on the PS4, Xbox One and PC in 2015.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The core gameplay in DMC4 remains unchanged from the previous installments; which means you kill demons as stylishly as possible by using fancy combos and agile acrobatic maneuvers. Both characters (Nero and later Dante) have a <a href="/sword/3055-1/" data-ref-id="3055-1">sword</a> button and a <a href="/gun/3055-118/" data-ref-id="3055-118">gun</a> button, and the two can alternate between the attacks on the fly. Sword attacks can be modified by the timing in which the button is pressed(holding the button as opposed to tapping the button as opposed to pressing the button and waiting a second), while gun attacks can be modified by charging the blast(which can be done by holding the gun button. Characters still lock onto enemies before attacking, and locking on allows players to launch opponents into the air, drive into them with the sword, or send them flying down to earth, depending on which direction the control stick is pressed while locked on. The player has control over the camera, but that control is frequently taken away by the game to show a more cinematic angle of a location and actually turning the camera takes a bit more time than in other games.</p><p>Nero has a few key differences from series hero Dante that change his combat style slightly. Firstly, Nero has the "Devil Bringer" a glowing, demonic right arm that allows him to grab opponents in combat and throw them(both on the ground and in the air). Nero can also pull opponents towards him from a distance by using the Devil Bringer while locked onto a target. The Devil Bringer in game boils down to another type of attack to use against enemies, but its more useful as a means of getting around larger opponents: Nero can latch onto opponents when throwing out a demonic projection of his devil arm and jump over the enemy, leaving them exposed to sword, gun and fists.</p><p>The Red Queen Sword is the blade Nero wields throughout the game. By holding the left trigger before or during combat (provided that Nero isn't performing any other combat action) will cause Nero to "rev" the Red Queen Sword(which can be seen in the top left corner of the screen) with blazing heat. If Nero charges the blade enough, he'll store a point of heat charge (called "Exceed" in the game) . Nero can rev and fill the sword with, initially, three Exceed points. When the sword has stored points, Nero's next sword attack will become faster and more powerful. However, there's only a one-shot charge to each point: the minute Nero swings his sword (in combat or out of combat, even if he isn't targeting an enemy) he will expend an Exceed point. Since players can't "rev" the sword in the middle of combat, players will have to decide whether to go into combat, or to lay off the offensive and charge the sword up before diving in. Players will also have to decide the best ways to use stored Exceed points, since they can be expended so quickly. Nero, however, has one trick up his sleeve when using the Red Queen's charging move: if the player presses the left trigger as his sword collides with a target he will instantly gain a point of Exceed charge, making his next attack faster and more powerful. Players can also utilize the advanced version of this skill by purchasing an upgrade that will completely max out the Exceed gauge if the left trigger is pressed at the exact time Nero's sword hits a target. This move will boost Nero's combat effectiveness, but the timing to nail the move will challenge even seasoned players. However, a player skilled using this move will, essentially, have unlimited Exceed charges, making them much more powerful in combat.</p><p>Additionally, Nero has a handful of abilities that, when used after building up one or more Exceed charges, become completely different abilities. These new abilities usually have a wider range and deal much more damage than their un-charged versions. The powered up abilities tend to have the prefix "Ex-" applied to their names as in Ex-Calibur, the powered up version of the ability "Calibur". There is also an ability that allows the player to expend all their built up Exceed points in one single, extremely powerful attack by using one of the "Ex-" abilities with a maxed Exceed gauge.</p><p>Nero, like Dante, can activate his "Devil Trigger", once he gets Yamato. This move will let Nero transform into his demon form for a brief period of time, making his attacks stronger and faster. By dispatching enemies with panache your style meter goes up, a high meter will net you more red orbs after you kill enemies. Red orbs are used to buy restorative items. There is another form of "currency" in DMC4 called proud souls. At the end of a level you're graded and your letter grade determines how much proud souls you get. These are used to buy new moves and abilities. DMC4 is also the first game in the series to allow the player "sell" purchased upgrades back. Any ability bought with Proud Souls can be exchanged for a refund equal to the cost of the upgrade. This allows players to customize their character's progression while allowing leeway for some experimentation.</p><p>In addition to its combat system there are also some segments of platforming and <a href="/puzzles/3015-932/" data-ref-id="3015-932">puzzle</a> solving.</p><h3>Difficulty Levels</h3><p>The game can be played in many different difficulty modes. In order of difficulty they are:</p><ul><li><b>Human</b></li><li><b>Devil Hunter</b></li><li><b>Son of Sparda</b></li><li><b>Dante Must Die</b></li><li><b>Heaven or Hell</b></li><li><b>Hell and Hell</b></li><li><b>Legendary Dark Knight</b> (PC)</li></ul><h2>Plot</h2><p>The game opens with <a href="/nero/3005-662/" data-ref-id="3005-662">Nero</a> making his way to an opera house whereupon he finds his path blocked by a group of <a href="/demons/3015-557/" data-ref-id="3015-557">demons</a>. As a beautiful young woman named <a href="/kyrie/3005-2903/" data-ref-id="3005-2903">Kyrie</a> sings at his destination, Nero slays the demons with ease and style, before making his way to the House. When he arrives, he sits and as Kyrie approaches, it becomes evident the two have a relationship. Nero begins to express his boredom when suddenly his own Demon Arm begins to glow...</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/57856/1118568-devilmaycry4_dx9_2008_07_31_18_37_03_15.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1118568" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.6" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:60.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/57856/1118568-devilmaycry4_dx9_2008_07_31_18_37_03_15.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1118568"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/5/57856/1118568-devilmaycry4_dx9_2008_07_31_18_37_03_15.jpg" alt="Nero fighting Berial"></a><figcaption>Nero fighting Berial</figcaption></figure><p>Crashing through the roof, <a href="/dante/3005-309/" data-ref-id="3005-309">Dante</a> infiltrates the church and murders <a href="/sanctus/3005-3191/" data-ref-id="3005-3191">Sanctus</a>, the High Priest of the Order of the Sword; a Pope-equivalent religious figure in this game's world. Nero, a member of the Order, understands the danger Kyrie is in and battles Dante, seemingly defeating him before Dante shows that he was just teasing Nero. Dante escapes and Nero leaves the church when he is assigned by <a href="/credo/3005-4580/" data-ref-id="3005-4580">Credo</a>, the leader of the knights in the Order, to hunt down Dante. As Nero goes after Dante he learns more about the truth behind the Order and the leader Sanctus, he also begins to wonder if Dante is even the real threat. Pushing through the city, from it's urban areas to it's forested landscapes before finding himself at the Headquarters of the Order, Nero battles demons and learns that a distinctly despicable character named Agnus is conducting experiments regarding Demonology.</p><p>Later, when Nero makes it to the Order Credo appears and explains that his Holiness has been resurrected and has directed Credo to kill Nero. Transforming into an 'Angelic' version of himself, he battles Nero, who remarks that Credo is no angel, but a demon. After defeating Credo, Kyrie appears and is disturbed by Nero standing over a beaten Credo, baring his Demon Arm. Nero tries to convince her that she doesn't understand. At this point <a href="/agnus/3005-4196/" data-ref-id="3005-4196">Agnus</a> appears and kidnaps Kyrie taking her to the highest confines of the Headquarters.</p><p>Fighting his way through headquarters, Nero eventually meets Dante again, who always seems to be one step ahead of Nero. Dante mentions that the sword Nero holds (which Nero found in Agnus' lair) belonged to his brother <a href="/vergil/3005-1804/" data-ref-id="3005-1804">Vergil</a>, and that he wants to 'keep it in the family'. After a brief scuffle, Nero realizes that Dante is toying with him and Dante tells him to keep the sword. Nero proceeds without giving him the blade.</p><p>At the top of headquarters, Nero comes across his Holiness, Sanctus, who has gone so far as to bring a giant statue of Sparda (known as the Savior) to life in order to vanquish evil. Nero battles with Sanctus for Kyrie's soul and seems victorious, until the Savior finally manages to grab a hold of him. At this point, Dante appears and tells Nero to give him his sword back. Nero tells Dante to come and get it, before giving Dante the finger as he is forced into the Savior...</p><p>Inside the Savior, Nero finds Kyrie and reaches out but the moment he touches her, she appears to disintegrate into nothingness. Vowing to get the two of them out, Nero slips away, also.</p><p>Outside the Savior, however, Dante watches as Agnus summons all the demons of hell to wreak havoc over the great city. Suddenly, before anyone is hurt, a series of Angelic Guard creations and the Savior eradicate them all and the townspeople feel safe. Along with <a href="/trish/3005-1881/" data-ref-id="3005-1881">Trish</a>, Dante realizes that they are going to have to clean up the mess...</p><h2>Weapons</h2><h3>Dante's Weapons:</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1872/180719-devil_may_cry_4_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-180719" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.82" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:82.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1872/180719-devil_may_cry_4_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-180719"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1872/180719-devil_may_cry_4_1.jpg" alt="Rebellion!"></a><figcaption>Rebellion!</figcaption></figure><p><b><i>Melee:</i></b></p><p><a href="/rebellion-sword/3055-522/" data-ref-id="3055-522">Rebellion</a> - <i>Sword given to to Dante by his Father</i></p><p><a href="/gilgamesh/3055-3919/" data-ref-id="3055-3919">Gilgamesh</a> - <i>Mechanical gauntlets and greaves</i></p><p><a href="/lucifer/3055-3348/" data-ref-id="3055-3348">Lucifer</a> - <i>Weapon which summons countless explosive spears</i></p><p><b><i>Firearms:</i></b></p><p><a href="/ebony-ivory/3055-788/" data-ref-id="3055-788">Ebony and Ivory</a> - <i>Guns handcrafted by Dante</i></p><p>Coyote-A - <i>Dante's modified shotgun</i></p><p><a href="/pandora/3055-837/" data-ref-id="3055-837">Pandora</a> - <i>Weapon which takes countless forms</i></p><h3>Nero's Weapons:</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1840/235886-nero_devil_may_cry_4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-235886" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.56293706293706" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1840/235886-nero_devil_may_cry_4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-235886"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Blue Rose!" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1840/235886-nero_devil_may_cry_4.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1840/235886-nero_devil_may_cry_4.jpg" alt="Blue Rose!"></noscript></a><figcaption>Blue Rose!</figcaption></figure><p><b><i>Firearm:</i></b></p><p><a href="/blue-rose/3055-192/" data-ref-id="3055-192">Blue Rose</a> - <i>Two-barreled gun</i></p><p><i><b>Melee:</b></i> <a href="/red-queen-sword/3055-112/" data-ref-id="3055-112">Red Queen</a> - <i>The knights of the Order's customary sword modified by Nero</i></p><p>Devil Bringer - <i>Nero's possesed arm</i></p><p><b>Note:</b> <i>Unlike Dante, Nero does not wield any new weapons as the game progresses, but rather heavily increases the abilities that his weapons can use.</i></p><h2>Information</h2><p>The fourth installment of the <a href="/devil-may-cry/3025-147/" data-ref-id="3025-147">Devil May Cry</a> series was released on February 5, 2008.

      <description><![CDATA[<h3>Tagline</h3><p>Civilization is only skin deep.</p><h2>Overview</h2><p>Primal is an action-adventure game developed for the PlayStation 2 by <a href="/sce-studio-cambridge/3010-278/" data-ref-id="3010-278">SCEE Cambridge</a>, the development team responsible for <a href="/medievil/3030-3457/" data-ref-id="3030-3457">MediEvil</a> and its <a href="/medievil/3030-3457/" data-ref-id="3030-3457">sequel</a>.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>In this game you can control either Jen or Scree and you can switch between the two of them at any time. Each of them have their own unique powers and when controlling one the other will be controlled by AI. The game itself is a combination of melee combat using Jen's demon forms, and solving puzzles, mostly using Scree's powers such as hardening into a statue or climbing on walls to solve them. Scree also is incapable of suffering any damage, which makes him ideal for scouting ahead rather than just charging into a new area.</p><p>Jen has four demon forms that each have their own abilities, and she can stay in them for as long as she wants, however in these forms she can only regain health by using Scree's energy reserves to replenish her (this energy comes from fallen foes and Scree cannot move while healing her). However, in human form Jen's life will replenish itself slowly.</p><h2>Story</h2><h3>Main Characters</h3><h4>Jen</h4><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11328/269795-jen_render01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-269795" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.046277665996" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:104.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11328/269795-jen_render01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-269795"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11328/269795-jen_render01.jpg" alt="Jennifer Tate, she prefers to be called Jen."></a><figcaption>Jennifer Tate, she prefers to be called Jen.</figcaption></figure><p>Jennifer Tate is the strong willed and headstrong protagonist of the game. She grew up in foster homes and now works as a waitress so that she can pay her way through college. She has a tattoo on her back that her boyfriend designed which is meant to be a symbol of protection. It is the same symbol she sees throughout the realm of Oblivion, and it glows when she is in her demon forms.</p><p>After coming into contact with a Ferai her braces activate and she is told by Scree that she is Arella's champion, and she is part demon. She was taken into Oblivion when she was a baby and has the ability to channel each of the demon forms of Oblivion.</p><h4>Lewis<b> </b></h4><p>Jen's boyfriend who is abducted at the beginning of the game. He seems to know a lot about magic and is also a lead singer for a rock band. He and Jen live together and apparently constantly have money problems.</p><h4>Scree</h4><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6279/266455-primal_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-266455" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6279/266455-primal_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-266455"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6279/266455-primal_2.jpg" alt="Jen and Scree"></a><figcaption>Jen and Scree</figcaption></figure><p>The gargoyle who wakes Jen up from her coma and helps her through the game. He speaks with a very matured and wise tone to contrast his short beastly appearance. He also serves as the second playable character in the game.</p><h4>Chronos</h4><p>Part of a machine known as the Oracle, his job is to maintain a balance of power between the forces of Order and Chaos.</p><h4>Arella</h4><p>The embodiment of Order. Scree describes her as being "all that is good and pure. She is strength and virtue. She is righteousness, she is nobility."</p><h4>Abaddon</h4><p>The embodiment of Chaos. Scree describes him as being "Lord of Corruption and Decay." He is Arella's eternal foe as the two of them are the two forces that control the universe.</p><h3>Plot</h3><p>After having her boyfriend, <a href="/lewis/3005-14732/" data-ref-id="3005-14732">Lewis</a>, attacked and abducted by a demon, <a href="/jennifer-tate/3005-1463/" data-ref-id="3005-1463">Jen</a> is left unconscious and falls into a coma. A gargoyle named <a href="/scree/3005-6647/" data-ref-id="3005-6647">Scree</a> appears, wakes Jen from her coma and convinces her to follow him into an alternate world, Oblivion, that is populated by demons. Once arriving in this world Scree gives her a pair of "Vamp Braces" which Jen comments feel like they were made for her. They are arm braces that will help her in her quest which is to save both worlds, the real and the alternate, and get her boyfriend back. Traversing the demon filled planes uncovers the story of this alternate reality, and the story between Jen and her boyfriend. Jen also discovers her supernatural powers and her ability to take on demon forms.</p><h2>Realms</h2><p>Primal has 4 different realms in which Jen has to travel through as she is trying to save her boyfriend Lewis. Each of the realms is affiliated with either Arella goddess of Order or Abaddon Lord of Chaos. Each of the realms also have their own symbols, symbols which when combined form the tattoo on Jen's back, showing her connection to these realms and her destiny.</p><h3>Mortalis</h3><p>This is the "real world" where Jen and Lewis live.</p><h3>Oblivion</h3><p>When all four realms are talked about together, it is called Oblivion.</p><h3>Solum</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/47060/1330219-primalsolumgateaddress.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1330219" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.83116883116883" data-width="77" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 77px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:83.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/47060/1330219-primalsolumgateaddress.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1330219"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="1330219-primalsolumgateaddress.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/47060/1330219-primalsolumgateaddress.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/47060/1330219-primalsolumgateaddress.jpg" alt="1330219-primalsolumgateaddress.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>A cold and harsh world of eternal night and winter.

It grants increased stamina, strength, agility, and focuses on melee punches and kicks for close range combat, as well as claw-like energy weapons. This form also increases Jen's running speed and the height of her jumps, allowing her to better traverse the world. Jen takes on the look of the Ferai people in this form, a race of fierce hunters who are strong and resourceful.</p><h3>Undine</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33745/1267710-primal_3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1267710" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.63660477453581" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:63.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33745/1267710-primal_3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1267710"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Jen's Undine Form" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33745/1267710-primal_3.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33745/1267710-primal_3.jpg" alt="Jen's Undine Form"></noscript></a><figcaption>Jen's Undine Form</figcaption></figure><p>This is the second for that Jen gains. If used above water, the Undine form will reduce Jen's demonic health to one, where she can be killed in a single strike. But if this form is used under water it replenishes Jen's health, and she gains energy tentacles that strike enemies from a distance. This is the only form which regenerates instantly, as a majority of the realm's journey is spent underwater, and Scree is unavailable. The Undine form also offers instant telepathy to Jen, allowing her to interact with Scree instantly.</p><h3>Wraith</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33745/1267708-primal_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1267708" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.63914780292943" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:63.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33745/1267708-primal_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1267708"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Jen's Wraith Form" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33745/1267708-primal_1.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33745/1267708-primal_1.jpg" alt="Jen's Wraith Form"></noscript></a><figcaption>Jen's Wraith Form</figcaption></figure><p>The third form obtained by Jen, the Wraith form, offers melee combat from a distance, using an energy whip and main-gauche to inflict damage on the vampiric Wraith. While in this form Jen can also use the Time-Shift ability, which allows her to briefly stop time, and slip past enemies if combat is not desired.</p><h3>Djinn</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33745/1267709-primal_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1267709" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.63660477453581" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:63.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33745/1267709-primal_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1267709"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Jen's Djinn Form" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33745/1267709-primal_2.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33745/1267709-primal_2.jpg" alt="Jen's Djinn Form"></noscript></a><figcaption>Jen's Djinn Form</figcaption></figure><p>This is the final form obtained by Jen. The Djinn form gives Jen immense power with two energy blades, that can be combined to create one single blade of even greater power.</p><h2>Music</h2><p>The Industrial-Rock group 16Volt make cameos during the game's opening as a band playing at the club Jennifer works, and also provided the instrumental music for a lot of the battle themes across the game. Some of the tracks were included in the Limited Edition, and the entire track-list was eventually made available via an Official Soundtrack release.</p>]]></description>

It is the seventh title in the <a href="../../grand-theft-auto/62-6/" rel="nofollow">Grand Theft Auto</a> franchise and the third GTA game rendered in full <a href="/polygonal-3d/3015-1430/" data-ref-id="3015-1430">polygonal 3D</a>. Players are introduced to new protagonist <a href="/carl-johnson/3005-329/" data-ref-id="3005-329">Carl "CJ" Johnson</a> as he departs <a href="/liberty-city/3035-15/" data-ref-id="3035-15">Liberty City</a> in 1992 and returns to his home state of <a href="/san-andreas/3035-17/" data-ref-id="3035-17">San Andreas</a> following his mother's murder in a <a href="/drive-by-shooting/3015-2930/" data-ref-id="3015-2930">drive-by shooting</a>. Upon arriving in <a href="/los-santos/3035-19/" data-ref-id="3035-19">Los Santos</a>, CJ is harassed by corrupt police officers and finds his old neighborhood of <a href="/grove-street/3035-4457/" data-ref-id="3035-4457">Grove Street</a> ripped apart by drug abuse and <a href="/gangs/3015-1397/" data-ref-id="3015-1397">gang</a> violence. Along with his brother <a href="/sean-johnson/3005-771/" data-ref-id="3005-771">Sean "Sweet" Johnson</a> and their friends, CJ sets out to become a major player within San Andreas' criminal underworld and reclaim the <a href="/grove-street-families/3015-8092/" data-ref-id="3015-8092">Grove Street Families'</a> former prestige as a powerful and respected street gang.</p><p>In addition to the GTA series' established open-world gameplay, <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/rpg-elements/3015-3603/" data-ref-id="3015-3603">role-playing elements</a> were introduced in San Andreas in the form of player <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/attributes/3015-1681/" data-ref-id="3015-1681">attributes</a>, which can be modified by performing certain activities such as <a href="/eating/3015-525/" data-ref-id="3015-525">eating</a>, <a href="/exercise/3015-8699/" data-ref-id="3015-8699">exercising</a> and <a href="/car/3055-322/" data-ref-id="3055-322">driving</a>. San Andreas also hosts a more diverse setting than its predecessors, with vast open countryside contrasting a variety of sprawling urban landscapes.</p><p>After its initial release, San Andreas was widely praised by critics and would go on to become the best-selling PS2 game of all time. The game was also released on both <a href="/xbox/3045-32/" data-ref-id="3045-32">Xbox</a> and <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC</a> in June 2005.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas introduced a number of significant gameplay changes compared to its predecessors. Unlike previous Grand Theft Auto games, San Andreas takes place across an entire state rather than a single city. The fictional state of <a href="/san-andreas/3035-17/" data-ref-id="3035-17">San Andreas</a>, a region heavily resembling <a href="/california/3035-1719/" data-ref-id="3035-1719">California</a> and portions of <a href="/nevada/3035-2800/" data-ref-id="3035-2800">Nevada</a> and <a href="/arizona/3035-504/" data-ref-id="3035-504">Arizona</a>, is divided into three major metro areas and their surrounding counties: <a href="/los-santos/3035-19/" data-ref-id="3035-19">Los Santos</a> (based on <a href="/los-angeles/3035-490/" data-ref-id="3035-490">Los Angeles</a>), <a href="/san-fierro/3035-20/" data-ref-id="3035-20">San Fierro</a> (<a href="/san-francisco/3035-191/" data-ref-id="3035-191">San Francisco</a>), and <a href="/las-venturas/3035-18/" data-ref-id="3035-18">Las Venturas</a> (<a href="/las-vegas/3035-78/" data-ref-id="3035-78">Las Vegas</a>).</p><p>For the first time, the player has the ability to swim, addressing one of the key complaints lodged against previous GTA games. Several of the game's missions feature swimming and diving as a critical element.</p><h3>Visual customization</h3><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/443/361594-gallery30.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-361594" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/443/361594-gallery30.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-361594"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/443/361594-gallery30.jpg" alt="Remember kids, helicopters are explosive!"></a><figcaption>Remember kids, helicopters are explosive!</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to this, San Andreas allowed for major character customization. Clothing, hairstyles, and even the build of your character can all be changed, with a greater selection of stores being unlocked as you progress through the game. Players are required to eat food regularly to maintain their health, but eating too much junk food will cause the character will gain weight. This can be avoided by working out in a gym, which also has the effect of improving the character's strength and stamina.</p><p>Players are also able to customize their cars. To modify a car, you merely have to take it to a garage that caters to such a type of car, and then select various modifications to be installed. These could include things such as the availability of <a href="../../nitrous/93-503/" rel="nofollow">Nitrous</a>, Hydraulics, as well as some minor cosmetic tweaks, such as the addition of rims and fenders.</p><h3>Stats</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1927/188808-sa_024.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-188808" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.7" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:70.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1927/188808-sa_024.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-188808"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="The bicycle is one of the new vehicles in San Andreas." class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1927/188808-sa_024.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1927/188808-sa_024.jpg" alt="The bicycle is one of the new vehicles in San Andreas."></noscript></a><figcaption>The bicycle is one of the new vehicles in San Andreas.</figcaption></figure><p>In order to make customization of CJ and vehicle usage more valuable, you will slowly improve with different stats. If you use one weapon repeatedly, you will advance your skill level with it. Earning a higher skill level means that you can do more with the weapons you carry. The levels move from Beginner, to Gangster, and finally to Hitman. Generally, getting the Hitman level means that you are able to move while shooting. With the one-handed weapons, however, you can also dual wield them, as a bonus for reaching the Hitman level. Dual wielded weapons are much the same as the standard weapons, but with double the firepower. Some special weapons, such as the <a href="/rpg-7/3055-682/" data-ref-id="3055-682">RPG-7</a> and the <a href="/flamethrower/3055-45/" data-ref-id="3055-45">Flamethrower</a>, do not have skill levels, so you cannot advance your abilities with them. Driving cars for long periods of time will increase your driving skill, and this will make vehicles more useful. Higher driver skill levels mean that cars will handle more responsively, and you won’t be fishtailing on a turn as often. Not only this, but a talented driver can also travel at higher speeds. CJ can also improve with his flight abilities, boating, and biking abilities too.</p><h3>Flying</h3><p>San Andreas also features a greater selection of aircraft than was seen in previous instalments. Players can increase their Flying Skill as they use aircraft to travel across the environment, with the effect that the different forms of aircraft become easier to handle and control.</p><h3>Relationship</h3><p>San Andreas added in a ‘girlfriend’ feature, which did not appear in any previous game in the series. This system was somewhat revamped for its second appearance, in 2008’s Grand Theft Auto IV. As you played through the game, you would occasionally meet a character who did not look like any other NPC. Chatting to them, and fulfilling certain criteria meant that you could take them on a date. The different girlfriends all have different criteria; for example: the police officer in the desert town likes overweight men. Once you had found a character to act as a girlfriend, you simply arrive at their home, and take them to where they request. Characters may want to eat, or go out dancing. One of the girlfriends has a request where you simply have to let her kill someone. Once you have completed the criteria, you return the character home, and your relationship with them will increase. Once you reach different milestones you will get different gifts from your chosen girlfriend. For example, getting to 50% will allow you to take their car, and getting to 100% will earn you a piece of exclusive clothing. Once you reach a milestone you will be invited into their house for some ‘coffee’ (see: “Hot Coffee” at the bottom of the page for more information).</p><h3>Gangs</h3><p>CJ is a member of the Grove Street Families, one of the various gangs featured in the game. CJ has the ability to recruit fellow gang members who then will follow him to support attacks on enemy gangs. CJ can also instigate gang wars, either by himself or with others, by going to an enemy gang territory and killing three gang members. After doing so, three waves of gangs will spawn one after the other. If CJ defeats all of them, the territory will go under the control of the Grove Street Families. The more territories that are under their control, the more money that is generated. It is possible to hold all the territory in Los Santos, resulting in Grove Street being the only gang present. This requires capturing some territories that only hold one side of a street block.</p><h3>Cheat codes</h3><p>Both <a href="/grand-theft-auto-iii/3030-3724/" data-ref-id="3030-3724"><i>Grand Theft Auto III</i></a> and <i>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City</i> had a wide host of cheat codes available, and <i>San Andreas</i> is no different. There are somewhat normal cheats that grant players full health, armor, weapons, vehicles, and money, as well as some cheats that change world properties such as massive bicycle bunny-hops, flying cars, homicidal citizens, and super punching. CJ's RPG elements can also be modified through cheat codes. There are nearly 90 cheat codes in total.</p><h2>Story</h2><h3>Los Santos</h3><p>The story of San Andreas follows one Carl ‘CJ’ Johnson, who has returned to the state after the death of his mother. Carl is, or rather, was, a member of the ‘Grove Street Families’, which were a powerful gang in the past. Carl was a founding member of the gang, and he left them when his brother Brian died, five years before the events of the game.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4/10047-vinewood.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-10047" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.7" data-width="400" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 400px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:70.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4/10047-vinewood.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-10047"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Vinewood, Los Santos.

Notice the inspiration?"></noscript></a><figcaption>Vinewood, Los Santos. Notice the inspiration?</figcaption></figure><p>The game opens up with Carl at the <a href="../../francis-international-airport/95-1139/" rel="nofollow">Francis International Airport</a> in <a href="/liberty-city/3035-15/" data-ref-id="3035-15">Liberty City</a>. He passes his luggage through the scanner, and proceeds to the plane. The game then cuts to his arrival in San Andreas. A police car pulls the taxi Carl is traveling in over, and the officers inside drag Carl out of the vehicle. Their plan is to frame Carl for homicide, after they shot dead fellow officer Ralph Pendelbury. Not only this, but to add insult to injury, they drop Carl off in the neighborhood of the Grove Street Families’ archrivals, the Ballas. The first main mission is mainly getting to grips with the game, and learning the controls of the BMX bike, which was a new feature added to the game.</p><p>Once CJ arrives home, he discovers the Grove Street Families are almost eradicated. The threat posed by the Ballas has shot up, and Grove Street is barely holding on. As Carl enters the family house, he is confronted by Big Smoke, a fellow gang member, who is wielding a Baseball Bat. Carl explains who he is, as Smoke seems to have forgotten him, and the two greet each other before Smoke invites Carl to travel to the funeral of his mother with him. Once the two men arrive, they are ambushed by the Ballas, who arrive in a <a href="/voodoo/3055-1549/" data-ref-id="3055-1549">Voodoo</a> car, and start shooting. To survive, your group run to <a href="../../bmx/93-2577/" rel="nofollow">BMXs</a>, and you are asked to escape the Voodoo and return to the Grove neighborhood. Once you return you will learn more about the gang and the members. The key members of the Grove Street Families are:</p><ul><li><a href="../../ryder/94-1338/" rel="nofollow">Ryder</a></li><li><a href="../../melvin-harris/94-772/" rel="nofollow">Big Smoke</a></li><li><a href="../../sean-johnson/94-771/" rel="nofollow">Sweet</a></li></ul><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4936/525659-gta_sa_2008_01_03_17_14_45_57.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-525659" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4936/525659-gta_sa_2008_01_03_17_14_45_57.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-525659"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Early image of Sweet and CJ together" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4936/525659-gta_sa_2008_01_03_17_14_45_57.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4936/525659-gta_sa_2008_01_03_17_14_45_57.jpg" alt="Early image of Sweet and CJ together"></noscript></a><figcaption>Early image of Sweet and CJ together</figcaption></figure><p>Sweet was the gang founder, and he is also Carl’s brother. Initially, he treats Carl with hostility after he ‘ran away’ five years ago. Early in the game he frequently asks CJ, “When are you going to run away again?”. Ryder and Smoke act as the gang lieutenants, and Smoke is the only member of the gang who seems accepting of Carl again. One of the key elements of the Grove Street Families is that they are strongly anti-drug dealing. The Ballas, however, are not, and make much of their profits peddling dope.</p><p>As you progress you will discover that <a href="../../kendl-johnson/94-4450/" rel="nofollow">Kendl</a>, <a href="../../sean-johnson/94-771/" rel="nofollow">Sweet</a> and Carl’s sister, is going out with a Mexican guy called Cesar Vialpando. Carl seems accepting of this fact, whereas Sweet says several stereotypical things about Cesar. However, Cesar introduces Carl to multiple different practices ongoing in San Andreas, such as illegal street races and lowrider meets. Cesar is a big fan of cars, and many of his missions revolve around driving and stealing them. Once you progress through the game, you will begin to take over territories for the gang, and start weakening the Ballas.</p><p>During missions, Ryder mentions a rumor that had been circulating. Apparently, a green <a href="../../sabre/93-1530/" rel="nofollow">Sabre</a> sports car was the vehicle used during the shooting of Carl’s mother. Initially, this Sabre appears to be nothing more than a simple rumor. Sweet decides that it is time for the Grove gang to become the powerful alliance they were in the past, and they arrange a ‘sit-down’ between the leaders of the gangs that used to be the alliance. However, as this happens, the SWAT attack the motel the meet is ongoing in. Immediately, Ryder and Big Smoke speed off, explaining that it is “Every motherfucker for himself”. However, Carl chooses to enter the motel and save his brother. You shoot your way through the motel, and eventually reach Sweet. The two escape the motel, while Ryder and Smoke arrive to pick them up again. This section of the game acts as an ‘on-rails’ shooter where you merely have to unload into the approaching police forces. After this mission, Sweet wants to take the fight to the Ballas, and completely annihilate the gang. Carl is asked to help with this attack, which he accepts. However, Cesar calls him and asks him to meet him first, before doing anything. When Carl arrives he gets into Cesar’s car, and watches Ryder, Big Smoke, and the corrupt police officers walk out of a garage. Then the worrying thing happens: they open the door to the garage… which houses a green Sabre. Ryder and Smoke had a part in the death of Carl’s mother. As CJ sets off to Sweet, he realizes that his brother is walking into an ambush. Frantically, he tries to call him to call off the attack, but he is too late to do anything. The attack goes ahead as planned under the Mulholland Intersection, and Sweet is trapped in an ambush. When Carl arrives, he fights off the Ballas, before a huge number of police arrive to arrest the survivors. However, before this happens, Sweet takes a bullet to the chest. Carl surrenders as he fears about losing another member of his family.</p><h3>Countryside and San Fierro</h3><p>Once CJ surrenders, the game cuts to all black and voices. Carl has a bag over his head, and the corrupt officers from the start of the game, <a href="../../eddie-pulaski/94-4305/" rel="nofollow">Eddie Pulaski</a>, Hernandez, and <a href="../../frank-tenpenny/94-954/" rel="nofollow">Frank Tenpenny</a> have Carl in the back of their patrol car. CJ pleads for them to take the bag off his head as he cannot breathe, and inquires about Sweet. Tenpenny says that Sweet is in a prison hospital, being treated for a bull et wound. He also says that they are in ‘The middle of fucking nowhere’, and leaves Carl there. In actual fact, you are in a small country village called Whetstone, which is near the largest peak in the game: Mount Chiliad. Tenpenny gets in contact with Carl, and instructs him to kill a man who is hiding out on Mount Chiliad. This man has evidence against Tenpenny and Pulaski, and they need to remove him from existence. Permanently. Once the killing is completed, you are instructed to take a photo of the corpse to prove that the man is dead.</p><p>Eventually, Cesar will get in contact with you again. He says the Los Santos gang scene has fallen into anarchy, and it’s extremely dangerous to be in a gang in Los Santos. When he asks where you are, he directs you to a cousin of his who may be of use to you. This cousin of his is Catalina. Catalina is a psychotic woman, who is obsessed with committing criminal acts. When CJ meets her, she wastes no time in explaining her plan for criminal deeds across the countryside of San Andreas. These missions basically involve different acts of theft, and then escaping the police. Catalina has frequent mood swings, as occasionally she is pleasant, before becoming extremely angry, extremely quickly. Not only do you meet Catalina, you meet a hippie by the name of ‘ <a href="../../the-truth/94-4578/" rel="nofollow">The Truth</a>’. This guy asks you to steal a <a href="../../combine-harvester/93-2056/" rel="nofollow">Combine Harvester</a>, so he may harvest drugs he is growing out in the countryside. He refers to his drugs as ‘whoop-de-doo’, and tells Carl he will be in contact with him again in the future.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/898310-wuzimuart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-898310" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.6083244397012" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:160.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/898310-wuzimuart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-898310"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Woozie's artwork" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/30036/898310-wuzimuart.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/30036/898310-wuzimuart.jpg" alt="Woozie's artwork"></noscript></a><figcaption>Woozie's artwork</figcaption></figure><p>Again, Cesar contacts you and asks you to meet him in the middle of the countryside so they can observe a meeting between Ryder and other key targets. These targets are known as ‘The Syndicate’, and will be integral to the game story. One by one the targets arrive, before you must take a picture of all of them individually. This is a reasonably straightforward activity, and is not extremely challenging. Before you go anywhere from here on, you must take part in two races. These races are both off road, and the second is merely the same course in reverse. The first run qualifies the winner to take part in the second race. In the second race, there is a driver by the name of ‘ <a href="../../wu-zi-mu/94-3904/" rel="nofollow">Wu Zi Mu</a>’, but he is known as Woozie. Woozie is extremely gracious in defeat, and calmly hands over the keys to the car he was driving: a black <a href="../../zr-350/93-1663/" rel="nofollow">ZR-350</a>. Not only does Woozie compete in this race, so does Catalina’s new boyfriend. This boyfriend happens to be <a href="../../claude-speed/94-322/" rel="nofollow">Claude Speed</a>, from Grand Theft Auto III. <a href="../../catalina/94-4446/" rel="nofollow">Catalina</a> hands over the deed to a garage in an industrial area of San Fierro, but refuses to hand over the keys to the car Claude was driving, as they ‘need it to go to Liberty City’. As soon as this race is completed, Carl receives a call from The Truth. The ‘whoop-de-doo’ is ready.</p><p>When Carl arrives at The Truth’s farm, he sees the quantity of drugs that The Truth has been growing. Some of the drugs had already been loaded into Truth’s van, but the police raid the farm with a helicopter before they could all successfully be loaded. The Truth tosses you a <a href="/flamethrower/3055-45/" data-ref-id="3055-45">flamethrower</a> and instructs you to incinerate everything, rather than allowing the police to confiscate evidence against him. Once the helicopter hovers overhead, The Truth then hands you an <a href="../../rpg-7/93-682/" rel="nofollow">RPG-7</a> rocket launcher and orders you to shoot it down. He then drives a small distance ahead to avoid the explosion. However, he stops to allow you to get in. The Truth refuses to drive, because apparently he has not driven in 20 years, and his van engine is surviving on 15 year old cooking oil. Not only this, his van is weighted down with half a ton of drugs (however, it actually is able to reach the same speed as other models). You are tasked with driving the van to the garage that you won from Catalina a few missions earlier.</p><h3>San Fierro</h3><p>Once the van arrives at the garage, which is in the industrial area of Doherty, you discover that Catalina has played you. The place is a mess, and is completely worthless. Cesar, and Carl’s sister Kendl both arrive at the garage as well. The only member of the group who sees the potential that the garage has, is Kendl. She sees the building as an opportunity to live a normal life with a legitimate business away from criminal activities. However, Carl and Cesar see the same option: an illegal chop shop. The Truth says he can possibly get some of his connections to be a help to the business. He has a lot of connections, and these men he knows are ideal for working with vehicles. CJ and The Truth set off in an Emperor car to find them at their current places of employment. One works at a gas station, and the other works at a hot dog van. Both of them are more than willing to get a different employment. However, the other man is Zero, a genius with electronics and computers. Zero is responsible for many of the gadgets you’ll use in missions, and he’s also interested in the chop shop idea. Once the chop shop is up and running, Tenpenny will be requesting you deal with a man. The man in question happens to be the DA (District Attorney), and he wants to frame him. To do this, you need to kill one of the valets at a hotel and steal his uniform. When the valet enters you need to take his car to your chop shop where it is to be loaded with drugs and then returned.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9825/846914-gallery34.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-846914" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9825/846914-gallery34.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-846914"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Pizza Shop in San Andreas... before the inevitable massacre" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9825/846914-gallery34.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9825/846914-gallery34.jpg" alt="Pizza Shop in San Andreas... before the inevitable massacre"></noscript></a><figcaption>Pizza Shop in San Andreas... before the inevitable massacre</figcaption></figure><p>After a while, you will receive the opportunity to visit Woozie. One of Woozie’s guys tells you that Woozie is actually blind, yet has incredible fortune. Apparently they call Woozie their ‘Lucky Mole’. Woozie wants to meet with another Triad group and see what is the cause of the goings-on in their neighborhood. However, when you arrive with Woozie you find the other Triad group massacred, and are ambushed. You find one of the other Triad members hiding in a garage because of the shooting, and Woozie takes pity on him and allows him to flee without punishment. The assailants who ambush Carl and Woozie are part of a newer Vietnamese gang, called the ‘Da Nang Boys’. Carl and Woozie escape in a stolen Da Nang Sentinel car, and kill the would-be assassins. After this, Woozie invites the leader of another Triad group to his location. This leader is ‘Ran Fa Li’, and the Da Nang Boys are planning to assassinate him as he leaves the building. Carl offers his services, and drives a decoy car into the countryside as a lure. The Da Nang assassins take the bait and Ran Fa Li escapes the assassination.</p><p>After some time, Woozie arrives at the garage, where he uses his knowledge to give information on the different syndicate members. Unfortunately, Woozie only knows two of the three people. However, they are <a href="../../t-bone-mendez/94-5065/" rel="nofollow">T-Bone Mendez</a>, leader of the San Fierro Rifa, and <a href="../../jizzy-b/94-5070/" rel="nofollow">Jizzy B</a>, the pimp who owns the Pleasure Domes. Mendez acts as an enforcer for Jizzy, and Carl decides to try and earn their trust. Initially, Jizzy gives Carl a list of objectives to complete. These objectives are merely to save his ‘hos’, as he calls them, from clients. Once the final client is killed, the police wanted level shoots up to three stars, and Jizzy tells you to keep the car, dump it, whatever – he doesn’t want a hot car back. After this, Jizzy sends you out with T-Bone to track down a member of the Syndicate, who was in a drug van, that had been hijacked. However, the only idea where the van is, is from the member of the, Syndicate who happens to have been forced into the back of the van, and is calling you through his cell phone. However, his phone has only a few minutes of battery left, and you have to find him quickly. Once you find him, a shootout ensues, and you must destroy the van. It’s better to have a setback in the loss of the drugs, than a full stop in the form of being arrested. Once the van is destroyed, all you have to do is escape to the Pleasure Domes and the mission is completed. Jizzy begins to trust Carl after this incident, and eventually, you are told to kill him. To do this, you break into the Pleasure Domes and work your way through the building. Jizzy escapes to his car, and you have to chase him down and destroy the car to kill him.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13313/709166-majestic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-709166" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.7" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:70.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13313/709166-majestic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-709166"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Bangin'.. because even gangstas drive the sorts of things." class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/13313/709166-majestic.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/13313/709166-majestic.jpg" alt="Bangin'.. because even gangstas drive the sorts of things."></noscript></a><figcaption>Bangin'.. because even gangstas drive the sorts of things.</figcaption></figure><p>Not only this, but Woozie is also interested in your services. The Da Nang boys are becoming more of a threat, and they try to stop you picking up a drug car for Woozie from the San Fierro airport. Once the vehicle is delivered, one of Woozie’s missions will begin with him asking if you are good underwater. He wants you to sneak onto a boat used by the Da Nang Boys, that happens to be in the harbor and plant a bug in it. However, after this, the next mission involves you strafing over the boat, killing Da Nang members with the mounted minigun. Woozie mentions in passing before this, that he is starting a new business venture that he wants you to be part of. He says he will call you when everything is finalized, and ready for business. However, as the helicopter performs strafing runs of the boat, one of the Da Nang Boys will strike the chopper with an RPG-7, causing it to plunge into the water. Everyone on board, except Carl is killed by this. However, you do take a casualty in the form of the loss of weapons. Once you have executed the Da Nang Boys leader, the mission is a success.</p><p>Before you may leave for Las Venturas, Cesar calls. He says he’s overlooking a meeting by members of the syndicate you’ve been tracking for some time. Among the men present, are Ryder, and T-Bone. Woozie volunteers the services of some of his men in the attack, where Carl plans to kill Ryder and T-Bone. To begin with, the Triad are cut down, and the only option you have is to go in guns blazing. Ryder will attempt to flee and steal a boat, where if you’re quick, you can snipe him immediately. Additionally, more information has appeared about the third man: <a href="../../mike-toreno/94-4565/" rel="nofollow">Mike Toreno</a>. After shooting down Toreno’s helicopter, you assume he is dead, before heading to Las Venturas and the desert surrounding it.</p><h3>Desert and Las Venturas</h3><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3584/194201-las_venturas.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-194201" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="300" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 300px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3584/194201-las_venturas.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-194201"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Las Venturas Nightlife" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3584/194201-las_venturas.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3584/194201-las_venturas.jpg" alt="Las Venturas Nightlife"></noscript></a><figcaption>Las Venturas Nightlife</figcaption></figure><p>Before too long, you are contacted by an unknown caller who happens to know about Sweet and his impending sentence. He invites you to visit him at his ranch in the deserts. However, to prove you are worthy he makes you race in a Monster Truck around the landscapes, and show your dedication. After this, he introduces himself as Mike Toreno…. the government agent. Toreno was working to take down the Syndicate as well, and that is why he ordered the destruction of the van back in San Fierro. It wasn’t to avoid being set back… it was to be a setback. Toreno has a lot of influence in the government, and he could have Sweet’s record and sentence cleared altogether, should he have a reason to. And his reason for doing so, unfortunately, means that Carl will have to attempt to complete some near-suicidal objectives.</p><p>Carl is ordered by Mike to steal a truck with a trailer full of goods. The goods themselves are never explained, but the truck needs to be hijacked as it travels down the freeway. Toreno recommends that Carl calls Cesar. However, he has already called Cesar for him, as he arrives just after the objective is explained. Cesar jumps to the truck, and then you need to commandeer it and take it to the defined location. After this, Carl is asked to do some other errands, such as shooting down a helicopter to cover some government agents as they parachute in. Initially, Toreno is quite hostile towards Carl, and sees him as nothing more than an expendable asset, but by the end of his final request, the two are reasonably friendly. One of the things Toreno needs you to do, is to learn how to fly a plane. He needs you to fly a plane to do some ’things’ for him. This means purchasing the Verdant Meadows airstrip in the desert for $80,000. Toreno requests that you deliver some goods to a location in San Fierro’s countryside, and then return. You need to do this without appearing on radar, or there will be fighter jets chasing after you, making the mission impossible. At the end of these missions, there is a huge plane sitting on the airstrip, and guys in suits are loading it. According to Mike, these men are a splinter cell from the governmental agents and they need to be stopped. To do this, you need to use a bike and speed into the plane as it prepares to take off. Once this is done, the plane needs to be destroyed in midair.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4/10052-sanfierro.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-10052" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="480" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4/10052-sanfierro.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-10052"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Fierro's Gant Bridge, linking it with Venturas" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/10052-sanfierro.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/10052-sanfierro.jpg" alt="Fierro's Gant Bridge, linking it with Venturas"></noscript></a><figcaption>Fierro's Gant Bridge, linking it with Venturas</figcaption></figure><p>Once this is done, The Truth has some uses for your airstrip as well, and he wants you to sneak into a restricted governmental area and steal a prototype for him. This means infiltrating the base at night, and sneaking through it to steal the object, known as the ‘Black Project’. The Black Project turns out to be a <a href="../../jet-pack/93-6/" rel="nofollow">Jetpack</a> that you can fly with. This pack means a lot to The Truth, as it allows him to find something he wants. Once you have the Jetpack he tells you to fly to a train travelling across the desert and steal, ‘Whatever it is they least want you to get’. This means killing everyone on board the train and then stealing a jar of green ‘goo’. According to The Truth, this goo proves the existence of aliens, as this is their DNA.</p><p>Once you have helped these two people, Woozie will call to let you know that his business venture is back up and running. It happens to be an Asian-themed casino along the Venturas Strip. The casino is called the Four Dragons, and he wants to offer you a partnership in the business. The meeting is disturbed however, by the announcement that someone was caught trying to vandalize the machines. Woozie says it’s madness, as he’s trying to open a <a href="../../triad/92-2880/" rel="nofollow">Triad</a> casino in a <a href="../../the-mafia/92-1294/" rel="nofollow">Mafia</a> town. However, Carl decides to be creative with torturing the thug. Carl asks one of the Triad members to tie the man to the front of a car, before driving dangerously to try and squeeze information out of him. Eventually the guy on the hood of the car cracks and says he’s part of the <a href="../../johnny-sindacco/94-9674/" rel="nofollow">Sindacco</a> family. This is all the information required.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4936/525657-gta_sa_2008_01_03_17_11_14_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-525657" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4936/525657-gta_sa_2008_01_03_17_11_14_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-525657"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="EL CAMINO.

EL EL CAMIIIINO.</figcaption></figure><p>The Sindaccos are in a shared business with at least one other crime family, and that happens to be the Caligula’s Casino, which is also located along the strip. Woozie and Carl decide to build a plan to ransack Caligula’s, and make the Three Dragons the bigger of the two casinos. To do this Carl builds the trust of the men at Caligula’s, by working for them. One of the biggest requests is that Carl flies back to <a href="../../liberty-city/95-15/" rel="nofollow">Liberty City</a>, and kills a man for <a href="../../salvatore-leone/94-1191/" rel="nofollow">Salvatore Leone</a>. This mission involves stealing a plane, and then flying to a point where the game loads the part of the city required (St. Mark’s Bistro), and then you get the opportunity to kill the target. Once this is done, you return to San Andreas, and report the success to Salvatore. After this, the other Mafia are enraged and send a hit squad to <a href="../../san-andreas/95-17/" rel="nofollow">San Andreas</a> to assassinate Salvatore Leone. However, he is prepared for this, and commands Carl to kill the assassins mid-flight. To do this, you steal a <a href="../../dodo/93-1499/" rel="nofollow">Dodo</a> plane at the <a href="../../las-venturas-airport/95-1158/" rel="nofollow">Las Venturas airport</a>, and leap to the hostile plane, which is a <a href="../../shamal/93-2584/" rel="nofollow">Shamal</a>. Once you are in the plane you merely need to kill the men traveling aboard it, and return to complete the job.</p><p>After some time you will find a mission where the rapper, <a href="../../madd-dogg/94-1320/" rel="nofollow">Madd Dogg</a>, is planning to jump from the roof of a casino due to the actions you undertook back in <a href="../../los-santos/95-19/" rel="nofollow">Los Santos</a> for <a href="../../og-loc/94-2692/" rel="nofollow">OG Loc</a>. A crowd of gamblers have gathered to encourage him to jump, and Carl wants to avoid it happening. He steals a <a href="../../walton/93-1632/" rel="nofollow">Walton</a> truck and angles it to break Madd Dogg’s fall. After this, you drive him to the hospital. He asks for you to be his manager in the future.</p><p>Before leaving and returning to San Andreas you will meet with Tenpenny and his ‘Polish lapdog’, Eddie Pulaski. They take you out to a desert town and instruct you to dig your own grave. Suddenly, Hernandez runs in, before hitting Pulaski around the head with a spade and announcing he’s with the DEA. Pulaski then kills Hernandez as well, before running to his car, which is a white <a href="../../buffalo/93-2625/" rel="nofollow">Buffalo</a>. The only vehicle apart from it that is sitting nearby happens to be a <a href="../../bandito/93-2606/" rel="nofollow">Bandito</a>, so it is your only option for pursuit. As you chase Pulaski, he shouts obscenities and taunts you. One of the most vicious of these is that the police touched his mother’s corpse, and this angers Carl in a major way. Once the Buffalo is badly damaged, Pulaski gets out. He is armed with a <a href="../../desert-eagle/93-90/" rel="nofollow">Desert Eagle</a>, so he can cause severe damage. Carl asks Pulaski if he has any last words as he lies against his car, dying. The final thing Eddie Pulaski said to Carl was “Can I fuck your sister?”</p><h3>Los Santos (return)</h3><p>After completing all the requested missions, you will return to Los Santos. Initially, you parachute over Madd Dogg’s mansion as it has been taken over by a drug lord. The mansion will become the new base of operations for the group, once it is reclaimed. To reclaim it you simply have to kill your way through before killing the drug lord in possession of it. Initially you jump with a group of Triads, who can help you during the mission. However, at least one of them will die due to the scripted cutscene. Madd Dogg needs his mansion back, as he wants to kick-start his career again, and what better way than to take back his mansion?</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1927/245219-311_gtasa_grove.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-245219" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.70198675496689" data-width="480" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:70.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1927/245219-311_gtasa_grove.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-245219"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Carl, Ryder, and Sweet sitting beside a car" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1927/245219-311_gtasa_grove.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1927/245219-311_gtasa_grove.jpg" alt="Carl, Ryder, and Sweet sitting beside a car"></noscript></a><figcaption>Carl, Ryder, and Sweet sitting beside a car</figcaption></figure><p>The next mission begins with Madd Dogg rapping, and then his sound booth being hijacked by Mike Toreno, who instructs Carl to leave the building and meet him outside. Toreno wants Carl to infiltrate a governmental aircraft carrier, and steal a <a href="../../hydra/93-2593/" rel="nofollow">Hydra</a> fighter jet from the boat. This jet will be needed to destroy some ships that are being used for spying by enemies of the state, apparently. After the jet takes off you will be pursued by two AI enemies, who pose little threat if you use lock-on with the heat seeking missiles on them. After destroying the boats, you are told to land the Hydra at Verdant Meadows. After this, Carl screams at Mike that he is never doing anything for him again. However, the Hydra will now spawn at this airstrip for the player to use.</p><p>After completing this mission, and starting the next one at Madd Dogg’s mansion, Toreno will personally enter the building and ask Carl to do one last favor for him. CJ pulls out a pistol and threatens him, but Mike says that the mission is to pick Sweet up. Toreno fulfilled his promise, albeit after requesting some suicidal tasks. Once Sweet has been picked up, he wants to be taken home to the Grove area. He does not approve of Carl’s wealthy new lifestyle, and makes his feelings known. Carl feels that there is more to life than the Grove Street Families, and Sweet disagrees, saying that he was born in the Grove and he would more than likely die in the Grove too.</p><p>The final mission involving Madd Dogg’s mansion involves Madd Dogg himself.

OG Loc flees on a hovercraft after this, before switching to a Go Kart when he reaches the Santa Maria Beach in Los Santos. Eventually, he is cornered, and surrenders the work of Madd Dogg to him.</p><p>During the time Carl has been away from the Grove, and Sweet has not been there to maintain it, the entire area has become territory of the Ballas. Sweet feels it is time to make the presence of the families known, and wants to push the Ballas out of their territory. Some of the Grove gang members have also dropped their flags, and are now working for the Ballas as drug suppliers and dealers. One of these men is B-Dup, who is now living in Glen Park, in the heart of Ballas territory. When Sweet and CJ pay him a visit he orders his drug fiend friend, Bear, to take care of them. However, Bear turns around and punches B-Dup, flooring him. Bear says he is ‘tired of the drugs, and tired of making your [B-Dup’s] goddamned toilet sparkle’. Bear and Sweet drive off in a car stolen from B-Dup, and Sweet says he’s going to help Bear get over his addiction.</p><p>After this, it shows the trial of Officer Frank Tenpenny. Tenpenny is being convicted for masterminding a major crime syndicate, and killing fellow officer Ralph Pendlebury. However, in an incredibly corrupt turn of events, Frank is let off without any charges being pressed, due to an apparent lack of evidence. This shock ruling drives the citizens of Los Santos into a frenzy, and starts a riot. During this riot, Cesar requests Carl’s assistance in using the events to his advantage. His plan is for his gang to push the Vagos out of their hood, and this means killing every one of them, during the anarchy ongoing. Not only this, but Sweet wants to find Smoke and kill him too.</p><h3>Finale</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1927/245293-1903_gtasa_big_smoke.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-245293" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.107250755287" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:110.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1927/245293-1903_gtasa_big_smoke.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-245293"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Smoke's artwork" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1927/245293-1903_gtasa_big_smoke.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1927/245293-1903_gtasa_big_smoke.jpg" alt="Smoke's artwork"></noscript></a><figcaption>Smoke's artwork</figcaption></figure><p>The finale of the game involves an assault on Big Smoke’s crack palace in Los Flores. Sweet and Carl arrive at the building to discover it is well protected, and it will be difficult to enter the building… unless, of course, a large enough vehicle ran into the walls. Conv eniently, there is a SWAT tank sitting down the road, fending off rioters along with the SWAT teams. Carl steals the tank, and drives it into the front of the building. After this, you must fight through the building solo, as Sweet wants to keep an eye on what is ongoing on the streets. There are multiple different floors to the building, and you need to reach the top one to find Smoke. Once you fight your way to the top floor you will see Big Smoke playing on a games console, almost trying to ignore what was going to happen. Carl confronts Smoke, and Smoke runs away wielding an <a href="../../ak-47/93-187/" rel="nofollow">AK-47</a>. After taking some damage, Big Smoke will turn the lights off in the room, but he leaves a pair of Nightvision Goggles sitting in the room, which you can steal to make the fight much, much easier. After succeeding to kill Smoke, he lies against a wall bleeding.

Tenpenny orders Carl to open the safe beside Smoke’s television and put the money into the bag that he hands him. Frank is preparing to flee the state, before the public find him and turn against him. Once Frank has the money, he sets the building ablaze before running.

However, you get the car under the ladder so Sweet lands safely in the car. He takes control, and this plays as another ‘on-rails’ shooting scene. Tenpenny’s engine cannot be destroyed so you merely have to focus on killing the enemies pursuing. Tenpenny tries to make it over the bridge at the Grove Street area, but he loses control, before crashing off the bridge into the Grove, where he dies. After this, there is a cutscene where Madd Dogg announces his success, and the Gold Record award that the group has earned from getting his rhymes back.</p><h2>Side Missions</h2><p>Considering the sheer size of San Andreas, additional side missions were to be expected. While these side missions are not essential to completing the game, they are important for getting the 100% completion statistic. Below are the side missions contained in the game:</p><p><b>Dealership</b></p><p>Once you complete the Driving School in San Fierro, you will receive a phone call to let you know that the dealership opposite the garage is for sale. The dealership happens to be called ‘Wang Cars’, and is on sale for a mere $50,000. Once you purchase the dealership, you will get some missions. Generally, these missions ask you to steal certain cars. Completing the mission will make the car you collected appear in the dealership. There are five missions for the Dealership strand, and they will earn you the following cars for your dealership:</p><ul><li><a href="../../uranus/93-1546/" rel="nofollow"><b>Uranus</b></a></li><li><a href="../../sultan/93-1573/" rel="nofollow"><b>Sultan</b></a></li><li><a href="../../stratum/93-1584/" rel="nofollow"><b>Stratum</b></a></li><li><a href="../../savanna/93-2642/" rel="nofollow"><b>Savanna</b></a></li><li><a href="../../elegy/93-2638/" rel="nofollow"><b>Elegy</b></a></li></ul><h3>Import and Export</h3><p>After completing the Dealership side mission strand, you will be able to access a chalkboard at the docks. This board lists some cars that you are required to steal, and then return to the ship at the pier. There are several different lists that you must complete to finish this activity. You are paid for each car you return to the ship, but the price varies depending on what condition the car happens to be in. If the car is not damaged in any way you will earn the top price. When you enter a car required for this activity, a popup window will alert you to this fact. Once you have the car, you need to drive it onto the pier, before using the crane to move it onto the deck of the ship. After a car is delivered, you can use the board to purchase a car of the same model for yourself. This is a good way to acquire rarer cars, after delivering one to the ship. Once you have completed a list you will earn a large cash bonus, and there will be two different vehicles you can buy after this. These include special vehicles, such as the <a href="../../monster-truck/93-1959/" rel="nofollow">Monster Truck</a>.</p><h3>Taxi</h3><p>If you enter a Taxi or <a href="../../cabbie/93-1494/" rel="nofollow">Cabbie</a>, you will have an option to engage in taxiing missions. These missions feel similar to the gameplay of <a href="../../crazy-taxi/62-118/" rel="nofollow">Crazy Taxi</a>. You need to find a fare, and then drive them to their desired destination within a time limit. Not only this, but there is a ‘tip meter’ that depletes depending on if you crash, and how long it takes you to arrive. You can still complete a fare with a fully depleted tip meter, but you will not earn much money. Not only this, but people will refuse to enter a badly damaged taxi, so driving neatly is very well rewarded. You earn extra money for completing multiple fares in a row. These rewards come in increments of five fares (5 in a row, 10 in a row, 15, etc.), and will give a considerable cash injection. You must complete 50 fares in total to ‘complete’ this activity. After doing so, all the Cabbies and Taxis in the game will spawn with nitrous and hydraulics.</p><h3>Vigilante</h3><p>If you enter a police vehicle, such as the <a href="../../police-car/93-844/" rel="nofollow">Police Car</a>, <a href="../../rhino/93-1647/" rel="nofollow">Rhino tank</a>, <a href="../../hpv-1000/93-2594/" rel="nofollow">HPV-1000</a>, or <a href="../../fbi-rancher/93-1645/" rel="nofollow">FBI Rancher</a>, you will be prompted to start the Vigilante side mission strand. These missions revolve around chasing down and killing criminals. What makes this mission strand difficult is that you can still earn a <a href="../../notoriety-system/92-2973/" rel="nofollow">Wanted Level</a>, and the criminals are always armed. Generally, the easiest way to complete these missions is through using the Rhino tank, due to its power and strength.</p><h3>Ambulance</h3><p>If you enter an Ambulance, you will be prompted to begin the Medical side mission strand. The aim is to pick up wounded civilians and drive them to a hospital. It plays similarly to the Taxi missions, but crashing can potentially kill a patient who is in the vehicle. What can make this somewhat easier is by using the siren to clear the roads, allowing you the right of way.</p><h3>Valet</h3><p>Once you finish the mission ‘777 We Tip’, you will earn a Valet uniform in your Wardrobe. This uniform needs to be worn to complete this side mission. To play this mission you have to travel to the hotel in San Fierro where the mission took place. Civilians will drive over, and leave their cars to be valet parked. You must take the car, and then park it in the underground lot at the hotel. You must park a specified number of cars before moving onto the next level. You earn more money for parking a car well, and for not damaging a vehicle. You are punished for killing the other valets, however. After completing the six levels of this mode, you will begin earning money from the hotel.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><p>Weapons in San Andreas are purchased in an <a href="../../ammu-nation/95-498/" rel="nofollow">Ammu-Nation</a> gun store. There are several of these in each area of the city, and they all stock the same weaponry. Below is a breakdown of all the weapons you’ll encounter in the state of San Andreas:</p><h3>Melee Weapons</h3><ul><li><a href="../../brass-knuckles/93-1157/" rel="nofollow"><b>Brass Knuckles</b></a>: Found under the bridge in the Grove Street. This replaces your default fist and does considerably more damage.</li><li><a href="../../knife/93-295/" rel="nofollow"><b>Knife</b></a>: Capable of performing stealth kills where you slit the target’s throat, assuming you are crouched behind the target.</li><li><a href="../../baseball-bat/93-39/" rel="nofollow"><b>Baseball Bat</b></a>: Acts as a form of club, and does a lot of damage. Generally the first hit floors a target, while the second hit will make sure they never get up again.</li><li><a href="../../chainsaw/93-168/" rel="nofollow"><b>Chainsaw</b></a>: Found on the Doherty construction site, amongst other places. One hit kill to enemies, and arguably one of the best melee weapons in the game.</li><li><a href="../../katana/93-690/" rel="nofollow"><b>Katana</b></a>: Able to occasionally kill an enemy with one hit. The Katana occasionally can decapitate, killing instantly.</li><li><a href="../../nightstick/93-942/" rel="nofollow"><b>Nightstick</b></a>: Found on the corpses of the police. Very common, albeit reasonably effective.</li><li><a href="../../pool-cue/93-1900/" rel="nofollow"><b>Pool Cue</b></a>: Earned through playing a game of pool.</li><li><a href="../../golf-club/93-475/" rel="nofollow"><b>Golf Club</b></a>: Found inside a Golf Caddy and on the grounds of the Avira Country Club.</li><li><a href="../../shovel/93-427/" rel="nofollow"><b>Shovel</b></a>: Found in Ryder’s back yard.</li></ul><h3>Pistols</h3><ul><li><b>9mm</b>: Common pistol used by police and gang members. It deals low damage with a large magazine size.</li><li><a href="../../silencer/93-489/" rel="nofollow"><b>Silenced 9mm</b></a>: Silenced version of the 9mm. Seems to do more damage.</li><li><a href="../../desert-eagle/93-90/" rel="nofollow"><b>Desert Eagle</b></a>: Deals an incredible amount of damage, although it only has 8 rounds in a magazine.</li></ul><h3>Shotguns</h3><ul><li><b><a href="../../shotgun/93-114/" rel="nofollow">Shotgun</a></b>: Easily found in police vehicles. Deals decent damage, albeit pump action lowers rate of fire.</li><li><a href="../../sawed-off-shotgun/93-1993/" rel="nofollow"><b>Sawn Off</b></a>: Shorter range than the standard pump action, although it deals much more damage.</li><li><a href="../../spas-12/93-1364/" rel="nofollow"><b>Combat Shotgun</b></a>: Deals a large amount of damage, and is semi-automatic. The Combat is arguably the best shotgun in the game.</li></ul><h3><a href="../../submachine-gun/93-766/" rel="nofollow">Sub Machine Guns</a></h3><ul><li><a href="../../tec-9/93-2808/" rel="nofollow"><b>Tec-9</b></a>: Frequently used by gang members, and fires fairly slowly. It doesn’t do much damage either, but it is cheap and common.</li><li><a href="../../uzi/93-260/" rel="nofollow"><b>Micro Uzi</b></a>: Similar to the Tec-9, albeit with a higher rate of fire and a bigger magazine. It is also used by different gang members.</li><li><a href="../../mp5/93-289/" rel="nofollow"><b>SMG</b></a>: Fires quickly and does the highest damage of an SMG. Comparable to an assault rifle, and is based on an MP5. It’s used by some gang members when in a gang war.</li></ul><h3>Assault Rifles</h3><ul><li><a href="../../m4-carbine/93-622/" rel="nofollow"><b>M4</b></a>: Used by the military. It has a larger magazine than the AK-47 but less accuracy.</li><li><a href="../../ak-47/93-187/" rel="nofollow"><b>AK-47</b></a>: Used by some gang members. It has a smaller magazine than the M4, but it is more accurate.</li></ul><h3>Rifles</h3><ul><li><b><a href="../../rifle/93-545/" rel="nofollow">Rifle</a></b>: Low rate of fire with high damage and precision. Also, it needs loaded with each round and is reasonably cheap.</li><li><a href="../../sniper-rifle/93-67/" rel="nofollow"><b>Sniper Rifle</b></a>: Precise, albeit with a low rate of fire due to the bolt action mechanism. Can deal major damage to targets over range.</li><li>Combat Sniper: Identical to the standard sniper rifle, but with a higher rate of fire.</li></ul><h3>Thrown Weapons</h3><ul><li><a href="../../grenade/93-111/" rel="nofollow"><b>Grenade</b></a>: Difficult to throw accurately, but can be quite effective against vehicles.</li></ul><ul><li><a href="../../satchel/93-3388/" rel="nofollow"><b>Satchel Charges</b></a>: Precision detonation and throwing, with high power. However, they are expensive.</li><li><a href="../../molotov-cocktail/93-75/" rel="nofollow"><b>Molotov Cocktail</b></a>: Can torch areas of the environment, and ideal against human targets.</li></ul><h3>Special Weapons</h3><ul><li><a href="../../gatling-gun/93-288/" rel="nofollow"><b>Minigun</b></a>: Overwhelming rate of fire, and extremely high damage. The minigun is extremely helpful in some sticky situations, such as during a gang war.</li><li><b><a href="../../rpg-7/93-682/" rel="nofollow">RPG-7</a></b>: Effective against vehicles, and also against clustered groups of enemies. The RPG also deals splash damage, which can be very beneficial.</li><li><a href="/fim-92-stinger/3055-1705/" data-ref-id="3055-1705"><b>Stinger</b></a>: Absolutely ideal against aerial targets. It works in the same way as the missiles on the Hydra jet do.</li><li><a href="../../flamethrower/93-45/" rel="nofollow"><b>Flamethrower</b></a>: Does low damage, but does stop enemies firing at you, assuming they are caught in the blaze.</li><li><a href="../../flowers/93-632/" rel="nofollow"><b>Flowers</b></a>: These are more of a gift for girlfriends than an actual weapon. Nonetheless, they can be found at gas stations.</li><li><a href="../../dildo/93-833/" rel="nofollow"><b>Dildo</b></a>: Again, another gift for girlfriends, but it can be found in the showers at the Los Santos police building.</li></ul><h2>Vehicles</h2><p>There are many different vehicles available in San Andreas, and they fit into different categories depending on what they are capable of. Here is a breakdown:</p><h3>Road</h3><p>There are different forms of road going vehicles in San Andreas, but the one characteristic shared by them all is that they cannot travel on any terrain apart from the ground. This grouping can be defined further, as:</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/32849/1315263-tahoma_5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1315263" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.45324347093513" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:45.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/32849/1315263-tahoma_5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1315263"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Tahoma front / side" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/32849/1315263-tahoma_5.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/32849/1315263-tahoma_5.jpg" alt="Tahoma front / side"></noscript></a><figcaption>Tahoma front / side</figcaption></figure><ul><li><b>Transport</b>: The transport section is built up of vehicles that can transport goods. While all vehicles can do this, these are more the kind of vehicles that you would encounter in a business.

These can range from police cars to fire engines, as they all fall under the ‘Emergency Vehicles’ category. This section includes the <a href="../../rhino/93-1647/" rel="nofollow">Rhino</a> tank, as well as the <a href="../../police-car/93-844/" rel="nofollow">Police Car</a> and the <a href="../../fbi-rancher/93-1645/" rel="nofollow">FBI Rancher</a>.</li><li><b>Special Vehicles</b>: This section is built up of vehicles you do not normally see on the roads, but are still road-going. Special Vehicles are vehicles such as the <a href="../../bloodring-banger/93-1654/" rel="nofollow">Bloodring Banger</a>, the <a href="../../hotring-racer/93-1655/" rel="nofollow">Hotring Racer</a>, and the <a href="../../go-kart/93-552/" rel="nofollow">Go-Kart</a>.</li><li><b>Civilian Vehicles</b>: Common vehicles driven by everyday civilians. This section contains the majority of vehicles in the game. While not all the vehicles are common, they are driven by civilians. This section contains vehicles such as the <a href="../../elegant/93-2615/" rel="nofollow">Elegant</a>, the <a href="../../huntley-sport/93-1575/" rel="nofollow">Huntley</a>, and the Bullet.</li><li><b>Gang Vehicles</b>: While all the vehicles driven by gangs in San Andreas are also driven by civilians, they are deserving of their own section, as anyone who is familiar with the vehicles of San Andreas will pay attention to a vehicle from this section, in case it happens to be a gang car. This section contains the <a href="../../tahoma/93-2640/" rel="nofollow">Tahoma</a>, <a href="../../tornado/93-2639/" rel="nofollow">Tornado</a>, and <a href="../../majestic/93-2620/" rel="nofollow">Majestic</a>.</li></ul><h3>Air</h3><p>Air-based vehicles are just that. They are merely vehicles that travel by air rather than roads. Not only this, they can also be split into two different subsections:</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13313/709254-hydra.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-709254" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.7" data-width="480" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:70.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13313/709254-hydra.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-709254"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="The Hydra jet.

If you see one chasing you, be afraid</figcaption></figure><ul><li><b>Planes</b>: A plane is a fast and mobile vehicle. The easiest way to define the difference between the planes and helicopters is with the question: can this vehicle hover in the air? The only vehicle that can vary from this is the Hydra due to the fact it is a fighter jet. This sub-section contains vehicles such as the <a href="../../rustler/93-2585/" rel="nofollow">Rustler</a>, the <a href="../../hydra/93-2593/" rel="nofollow">Hydra</a>, and the <a href="../../nevada/93-2586/" rel="nofollow">Nevada</a>.</li><li><b>Helicopters</b>: Helis are much slower than planes, but they can be more precise at the same time. Using an armed chopper allows you to aim accurately due to the hovering ability that they possess. This sub-section is built up of vehicles such as the <a href="../../sea-sparrow/93-1649/" rel="nofollow">Sparrow</a>, and the Hunter.</li></ul><h3>Water</h3><p>Boats, and other such vehicles are hard to define any further, if it is even possible. Water-based vehicles include such things as the <a href="../../squalo/93-1617/" rel="nofollow">Squalo</a>, and other boats. In short: if it floats, it’s a boat.</p><h2>Re-releases and Remaster</h2><p>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas was re-released on the <a href="/xbox-360/3055-1229/" data-ref-id="3055-1229">Xbox 360</a> as an Xbox Original title in 2008. It was ported to <a href="/mac/3045-17/" data-ref-id="3045-17">Mac</a> in 2010 and was added as a PS2 Classic via the <a href="/playstation-network/3015-2623/" data-ref-id="3015-2623">PlayStation Network</a> in late 2012.

At this time, the original version of San Andreas was removed from the Xbox Live Store and PlayStation Network (although the title remains available in North America). The key changes to the gameplay brought with the port are as follows:</p><ul><li>Enhancements were made to the graphics and lightening of the game.</li><li>The display of the players money was altered to be of the display method used as of <a href="/grand-theft-auto-iv/3030-20457/" data-ref-id="3030-20457">Grand Theft Auto IV</a> in that the players money will display $350 rather than $00000000350.</li><li>Mid-mission checkpoints were implemented into the game.</li><li>The co-op element of the game was removed.</li><li>Achievements were added to the game.</li><li>Missions in which a vehicles health is of significance now feature a health bar displayed for the vehicle.</li><li>Driving is done via the triggers.</li><li>The lock on / aiming system with weapons was altered.</li><li>Small previewing icons were added to shops displaying previews of purchasable items.</li><li>The menu choice in restaurants was altered allowing specific items to be selected rather than the player having to cycle through each available option.</li><li>An autosave feature was added after each mission.</li><li>Several songs were removed from the game due to licenses expiring.</li><li>An automatic jump was added causing players to automatically climb objects in the environment upon contact with them.</li></ul><h2>Controversy</h2><table><tbody><tr><td><h3>Hot Coffee Scandal</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13313/709164-hustler.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-709164" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.7" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:70.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13313/709164-hustler.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-709164"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="The car of one of CJ's girlfriend.

If you can overlook the other picture, this is actually relevant</figcaption></figure> In June of 2005 "Hot Coffee" was released by Dutch modder Patrick Wildenborg. What this software patch did was to unblock a previously inaccessible section of the game which had been created by Rockstar but then abandoned before release of the game. The section of the game in question was part of the "dating missions" where CJ could start a relationship with up to 6 girlfriends. Once he had successfully dated a girl she may invite him into her house for "coffee" and from there the player gets an exterior view of the house, from which they could hear CJ and his girlfriend engaging in sexual intercourse. With the Hot Coffee mod installed this scene is replaced with a minigame in which the player controls CJ's actions during the sex scene. None of the 6 possible scenes contained any nudity (although nude textures were later added by third-parties) and the animations and textures were clearly unfinished.</td></tr><tr><td><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/316/529371-gta191.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-529371" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/316/529371-gta191.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-529371"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Where are her arms?" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/316/529371-gta191.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/316/529371-gta191.jpg" alt="Where are her arms?"></noscript></a><figcaption>Where are her arms?</figcaption></figure> Rockstar initially denied that such a minigame was created by them and claimed that it was the result of "hackers". However it was later shown that Hot Coffee could be unlocked in both the Xbox and PS2 versions of the games. Both Rockstar and the ESRB ratings board came under fire for allowing the game to be rated M with no mention of sexual content.<br />On July 20th 2005, the ESRB announced that the current version of San Andreas at that time would be re-rated AO while Rockstar stated that it would produce all future versions of the game with the offending scenes removed. Rockstar owners Take-Two is said to have lost an estimated $6.9 million as a result of the controversy.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>"Myths" surrounding the game</h2><p>With the game's immense scale, it was only a matter of time before myths and rumors popped up about what was roaming in the state of San Andreas. From things like Bigfoot and <a href="../../ufo/93-611/" rel="nofollow">UFO's</a>, to people like Leatherface appearing. Even the game's satirical cult the Epsilon Program, became a source of myths and legend. Most (But not all) of these myths have been debunked in the years since the game's release. There were confirmed ones though like a rusted wheelchair on a dock which was in reference to a then future release of <a href="../../manhunt-2/61-21258/" rel="nofollow">Manhunt 2</a>. Also, a <a href="../../cemetery/95-1552/" rel="nofollow">cemetery</a> that glowed at night at certain times.</p><h2>Mods</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/32849/1561207-sa_mp_003.png" data-ref-id="1300-1561207" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/32849/1561207-sa_mp_003.png" data-ref-id="1300-1561207"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="An example of SA:MP on a role-play server, along with a modded Audi A8 W12 sedan." class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/32849/1561207-sa_mp_003.png"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/32849/1561207-sa_mp_003.png" alt="An example of SA:MP on a role-play server, along with a modded Audi A8 W12 sedan."></noscript></a><figcaption>An example of SA:MP on a role-play server, along with a modded Audi A8 W12 sedan.</figcaption></figure><p>When the game released on PC, many players took to the modding of San Andreas. Considering the scale of the game, there have been some extremely large tasks and projects organized by different PC gamers. Some players have made extremely comprehensive mods, including completely different stories, and reworked cities. Many GTA modding sites frequently still have mods for San Andreas uploaded daily. Some of the most common mods for the game are different cars and weapons. Videos of San Andreas on PC frequently show licensed cars due to modders creating them for use in the game world. It may not always be possible to mod versions of the game. Only the disc-based copies of San Andreas can support modding, and even then, only Version 1.1 of the game can be modded on. However, due to the works of the community, newer versions can be downgraded with different programs and software. On top of this, some coders have built programs to automatically install mods for players who are unsure of swapping files in the game folder.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/32849/1561208-sa_mp_001.png" data-ref-id="1300-1561208" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/32849/1561208-sa_mp_001.png" data-ref-id="1300-1561208"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Silvia S15 mod in San Andreas Multiplayer, albeit with one of the bugs that can be encountered." class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/32849/1561208-sa_mp_001.png"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/32849/1561208-sa_mp_001.png" alt="Silvia S15 mod in San Andreas Multiplayer, albeit with one of the bugs that can be encountered."></noscript></a><figcaption>Silvia S15 mod in San Andreas Multiplayer, albeit with one of the bugs that can be encountered.</figcaption></figure><p>One of the most ambitious mods, and one of the mods most commonly used alongside San Andreas is SA:MP. This mod allows players to create multiplayer matches and play with friends. Many of the servers created have different rules, and RPG servers are fairly common. They aim to simulate life, allowing players to own houses, cars, and so on. 'Deathmatch' servers are also commonly encountered, as players enjoy killing each other. Some mods can cause instabilities with certain features. For example, some modded cars cannot be altered in the garages. Trying to modify these cars can cause the game to stop responding or crash.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p>Like all the Grand Theft Auto games, there are several different in-game radio stations. There are many different stations in the game, but the music played by the stations remain the same. However, with Radio Los Santos, initially the radio is advertised on by Madd Dogg, but after completing missions to make OG Loc more popular, he will take over the show. Once the game is completed, Madd Dogg will return as the advertiser. Below are the names of all the stations in San Andreas, their logo, their genre of music, and their playlists.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>WCTR Talk Radio</th></tr><tr><td><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/21933/787214-wctr_talk_radio.png" data-ref-id="1300-787214" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.92666666666667" data-width="150" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 150px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:92.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/21933/787214-wctr_talk_radio.png" data-ref-id="1300-787214"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="787214-wctr_talk_radio.png" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/21933/787214-wctr_talk_radio.png"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/21933/787214-wctr_talk_radio.png" alt="787214-wctr_talk_radio.png"></noscript></a></figure><b>Genre:</b> Talk Show<br /><b>Producer:</b> Lazlow<br /><ul><li>The News - <b>Leanne Forget</b></li><li>The Tight End Zone - <b>Derrick Thakery</b></li><li>The Wild Traveller - <b>James Pedeaston</b></li><li>Entertaining America - <b>Billy Dexter</b></li><li>Gardening with Maurice - <b>Maurice</b></li><li>I Say, You Say - <b>Peyton and Mary Phillips</b></li><li>Lonely Hearts - <b>Christy MacIntyre / Fernando</b></li><li>Area 53 - <b>Marvin Trill</b></li></ul><br />Lazlow himself appears in one of these shows.

Lonely Hearts is unique in the game, as it is initially hosted by Christy MacIntyre.

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p>This game is similar to <a href="/galaxian/3030-2445/" data-ref-id="3030-2445"> Galaxian</a> in that it is about a space ship shooting waves of enemies that come around the screen, but with a <a href="/vertical-scrolling/3015-1899/" data-ref-id="3015-1899">vertical scrolling</a> playfield. The ship itself starts as a 3 stage ship and you control one stage at a time. The nose cone stage of the ship only has one cannon but the second and third have two. Also, after you defeat a few waves you can dock one stage onto the next, giving you more fire power with which to defeat the enemies.</p><p> </p>]]></description>

A squad-based RPG where the goal is for players to create teams of four superheroes from the initial roster of characters and complete various missions which in turn can unlock more characters for players to use. Each character also has four alternative costumes to be unlocked which grant bonuses to their performance. Bonuses are also granted if players create one of the superhero teams from the comics such as the Fantastic Four. Each character brings unique abilities to a players party and experience points gained from combat can be used to upgrade the abilities of selected heroes. Players can change who they want in their party throughout the game allowing them to use unlocked characters without needing to start a new game to use them.</p><p>The basic premise of Marvel Ultimate Alliance is to stop the evil mastermind Dr. Doom and the group of supervillains known as the Masters of Evil from taking over the world and players will find themselves aiding high-profile superheroes and visiting familiar locations such as <a href="/stark-tower/3035-2351/" data-ref-id="3035-2351" data-mce-href="/stark-tower/3035-2351/">Stark Tower</a> and the S.H.I.E.L.D Helicarrier along the way. Players will find they receive an alternate ending based on decisions they make during the game. On top of the already mentioned unlockable characters and costumes, players can also access bonus material such as artwork and extra missions that don't relate to the main story of the game.</p><h2>Characters</h2><p>Marvel Ultimate Alliance has a number of characters for players to form a group with at the start of the game, with many more that can be unlocked by playing through it. However some characters can only be unlocked on platform specific versions of the game. The <a href="/xbox-360/3045-20/" data-ref-id="3045-20" data-mce-href="/xbox-360/3045-20/">Xbox 360</a> version of the game received eight additional characters through downloadable content (which is no longer available on the <a href="/xbox-live-marketplace/3045-86/" data-ref-id="3045-86" data-mce-href="/xbox-live-marketplace/3045-86/">Xbox Live Marketplace</a>). A later version of the game was released on the Xbox 360 in May 2007 titled 'Marvel Ultimate Alliance Gold' and had these same additional characters included on the disc.</p><h3>Playable initially</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2130/636201-art_39.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-636201" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.6" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:60.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2130/636201-art_39.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-636201"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2130/636201-art_39.jpg" alt="Spider-Woman"></a><figcaption>Spider-Woman</figcaption></figure><ul><li><a href="../../spider-man/94-69/" rel="nofollow" data-mce-href="../../spider-man/94-69/">Spider-Man</a></li><li><a href="../../captain-america/94-1376/" rel="nofollow" data-mce-href="../../captain-america/94-1376/">Captain America</a></li><li><a href="../../iron-man/94-1370/" rel="nofollow" data-mce-href="../../iron-man/94-1370/">Iron Man</a></li><li><a href="../../thor/94-4899/" rel="nofollow" data-mce-href="../../thor/94-4899/">Thor</a></li><li><a href="../../wolverine/94-10/" rel="nofollow" data-mce-href="../../wolverine/94-10/">Wolverine</a></li><li><a href="../../human-torch/94-2358/" rel="nofollow" data-mce-href="../../human-torch/94-2358/">Human Torch</a></li><li><a href="../../the-thing/94-2388/" rel="nofollow" data-mce-href="../../the-thing/94-2388/">Thing</a></li><li><a href="../../mr-fantastic/94-4176/" rel="nofollow" data-mce-href="../../mr-fantastic/94-4176/">Mr. Fantastic</a></li><li><a href="../../invisible-woman/94-3498/" rel="nofollow" data-mce-href="../../invisible-woman/94-3498/">Invisible Woman</a></li><li><a href="../../ice-man/94-988/" rel="nofollow" data-mce-href="../../ice-man/94-988/">Ice Man</a></li><li><a href="../../ms-marvel/94-5538/" rel="nofollow" data-mce-href="../../ms-marvel/94-5538/">Ms. Marve</a><a href="../../ms-marvel/94-5538/" rel="nofollow" data-mce-href="../../ms-marvel/94-5538/">l</a></li><li><a href="../../luke-cage-power-man/94-2385/" rel="nofollow" data-mce-href="../../luke-cage-power-man/94-2385/">Luke Cage</a></li><li><a href="../../elektra/94-5536/" rel="nofollow" data-mce-href="../../elektra/94-5536/">Elektra</a></li><li><a href="../../spider-woman/94-5419/" rel="nofollow" data-mce-href="../../spider-woman/94-5419/">Spider-Woman</a></li><li><a href="../../deadpool/94-1472/" rel="nofollow" data-mce-href="../../deadpool/94-1472/">Deadpool</a></li><li><a href="../../storm/94-2374/" rel="nofollow" data-mce-href="../../storm/94-2374/">Storm</a></li><li><a href="../../colossus/94-2382/" rel="nofollow" data-mce-href="../../colossus/94-2382/">Colossus</a> (360, PS3, Wii only)</li><li><a href="../../moon-knight/94-2387/" rel="nofollow" data-mce-href="../../moon-knight/94-2387/">Moon Knight</a> (360, PS3, Wii only)</li><li><a href="/jean-grey/3005-2424/" data-ref-id="3005-2424" data-mce-href="/jean-grey/3005-2424/">Jean Grey</a> (GBA only)</li><li><a href="/namor-the-sub-mariner/3005-4497/" data-ref-id="3005-4497" data-mce-href="/namor-the-sub-mariner/3005-4497/">Namor</a> (GBA only)</li></ul><h3>Unlockable</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2130/636223-art_41.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-636223" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.6" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:60.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2130/636223-art_41.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-636223"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Ms.Marvel" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2130/636223-art_41.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2130/636223-art_41.jpg" alt="Ms.Marvel"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ms.Marvel</figcaption></figure><ul><li><a href="../../black-panther/94-3584/" rel="nofollow" data-mce-href="../../black-panther/94-3584/">Black Panther</a></li><li><a href="../../blade/94-2386/" rel="nofollow" data-mce-href="../../blade/94-2386/">Blade</a></li><li><a href="../../doctor-strange/94-4900/" rel="nofollow" data-mce-href="../../doctor-strange/94-4900/">Dr. Strange</a></li><li><a href="../../ghost-rider/94-2467/" rel="nofollow" data-mce-href="../../ghost-rider/94-2467/">Ghost Rider</a></li><li><a href="../../nick-fury/94-4905/" rel="nofollow" data-mce-href="../../nick-fury/94-4905/">Col.

      <deck><![CDATA[Star Wars racing game, sequel to Star Wars Episode I: Racer]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Summary</h2><p>After the success of Star Wars Episode I: Racer, <a href="/lucasarts-entertainment-company-llc/3010-644/" data-ref-id="3010-644">LucasArts</a> outsourced a sequel to developer <a href="/rainbow-studios/3010-2700/" data-ref-id="3010-2700">Rainbow Studios</a> to develop. Released for the <a href="/playstation-2/3045-19/" data-ref-id="3045-19">PlayStation 2</a> in February 2002, the game allowed players to take controls of 23 pilots on 13 different locations. The "Racer Revenge" tagline of the game comes from the racer Sebulba's attempt to exact revenge on Anakin Skywalker for his defeat to him in the pod race featured in the film Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace.</p><p>The game was also one of the four initial PlayStation 2 HD Classics line of games on the <a href="/playstation-4/3045-146/" data-ref-id="3045-146">PlayStation 4</a>. The game was originally only available as part of bundle of Star Wars games (which also featured <a href="/star-wars-jedi-starfighter/3030-4017/" data-ref-id="3030-4017">Star Wars: Jedi Starfighter</a>, <a href="/star-wars-bounty-hunter/3030-17571/" data-ref-id="3030-17571">Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</a> and <a href="/super-star-wars/3030-14450/" data-ref-id="3030-14450">Super Star Wars</a>) as part of a special edition release of <a href="/star-wars-battlefront/3030-42912/" data-ref-id="3030-42912">Star Wars Battlefront</a>. Soon after though all of the games were made available for purchase separately shortly after the PlayStation 2 HD Classics was made offical and additional PlayStation 2 games were also released. </p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Similar to its predecessor (<a href="/star-wars-episode-i-racer/3030-13526/" data-ref-id="3030-13526">Star Wars: Episode I - Racer</a>) the gameplay is largely the same as the previous game in the series. The most drastic change would be the additional mechanic of a knock-out system wherein all racers are given a health bar for their pod which if emptied forces the racer to retire from the racer. Pods take damage via colliding with other racers or scenery and by overusing the boost feature of the podracer. Health can be recovered by entering into a health recovery state though this comes at a speed penality as the podracer slows down whilst in this mode.</p><h3>Game Modes:</h3><h4>Single Play</h4><p>This mode presents the player with three options:</p><ul><li><strong>Single Event </strong>- This mode allows players to race on any unlocked track with any unlocked racer anywhere from 1 to 25 laps.</li><li><strong>Practice </strong>- Similar to single event with the exception that players can set the number of opponents from 1 to 8.</li><li><strong>Time Trial</strong> - Similar also to single event except that players are now the only racer and are attempting to set the best lap time.</li></ul><h4>Vs Race</h4><p>The competitive split-screen mode wherein players race against human opponents using any of the unlocked racers and track locations.</p><h4>Tournament</h4><p>The single player campaign aspect of the game where players select their character of choice and race across the 13 tracks within the game. Each race has an associated prize amount award for coming in either first, second or third place and a bonus multiplier is applied based on the number of other racers the player manages to retire during the race. The awarded credits can then be used to upgrade the player's race craft after each race with the exception of the 3 secret characters whose stats cannot be upgraded. Vehicles can be upgraded in the following 5 statistics on a point scale of 1-20:</p><ul><li>Acceleration</li><li>Top Speed</li><li>Handling</li><li>Defence</li><li>Repair</li><li>Cooling</li></ul><p>Worth noting also is that once a player decides to progress onto the next race location they are unable to go back and race on the previous locale. Instead they are forced to always progress forward through the 13 race locations.</p><p>The tournament mode's structure is as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Galactic Trials:</strong><ol><li>Mos Espa Open</li><li>SoroSuub Facility</li><li>Orotoru G'am</li><li>Watchtower Run</li></ol></li><li><strong>Podracing Open:</strong><ol><li>The Brightlands</li><li>The Badlands</li><li>The Ballast Complex</li><li>Ruins of Carnuss Gorgull</li></ol></li><li><strong>Hutt Championships:</strong><ol><li>Serres Sarrano</li><li>Grand Reefs</li><li>Citadel</li><li>Nightlands</li><li>Boonta Eve Classic (Mos Espa Grand Arena)</li></ol></li></ul><h3>Characters:</h3><p>The game contains 23 characters to select from which with the exception of the 5 secret characters are unlocked via progressing through the tournament mode with one character.</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Name</th><th scope="col">Default Stats</th><th scope="col">Unlock Requirements</th><th

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p>Rogue Galaxy was developed by <a href="/level-5-inc/3010-1659/" data-ref-id="3010-1659">Level 5</a>, the same studio that developed <a href="/dragon-quest-viii-journey-of-the-cursed-king/3030-3579/" data-ref-id="3030-3579">Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King</a> and <a href="/jeanne-darc/3030-20593/" data-ref-id="3030-20593">Jeanne d'Arc</a>. Developed for the PS2, it was released in Japan on December 8, 2005, and in North America on January 30, 2007. </p><h2>Plot</h2><h3>Chapter I - Departure</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6246/328136-roguegalaxy71.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-328136" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.59548611111111" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:59.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6246/328136-roguegalaxy71.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-328136"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6246/328136-roguegalaxy71.jpg" alt="Jaster tries to escape a large desert worm on Rosa"></a><figcaption>Jaster tries to escape a large desert worm on Rosa</figcaption></figure><p>The story begins on the desert planet Rosa. It centers around a teenager named Jaster Rogue, who was abandoned on the planet at a very young age. He was raised by a priest named Raul who became like a father to him. Ever since he was young, Jaster dreamed of exploring the galaxy. That wish is fulfilled when a giant creature attacks his village. Jaster goes off to fight the creature, with an unknown ally at his side.</p><p>This unknown ally turns out to be Desert Claw, a famous hunter. He entrusts Jaster with his sword, the Desert Seeker, and leaves him to be discovered by a bumbling pair of space pirates. Believing that Jaster is in fact Desert Claw, the two ask him to join them on their journey throughout the galaxy. Jaster refuses at first, but then the two sides agree on destroying the monster before any talk about space travel.</p><p>After destroying the large monster, Jaster decides to accept the two pirates' offer, and the next day manages to get aboard the ship with the help of a beautiful pirate girl before they are all swallowed by a giant sand beast.</p><h3>Chapter II - The Jungle Planet</h3><p>Jaster is given a quick tour of the Dorgenark and its crew: the pudgy Simon, the helpful robot Steve, a gruff one-eyed hunter named Zegram, a talking cat first mate, and the girl who saved him back on Rosa named Kisala. She also reveals that she is Captain Dorgengoa's daughter. Suddenly, the ship is attacked by flying space-beasts and is forced to make a crash landing on the jungle planet Juraika.</p><p>After surviving the crash, Steve and Simon discover that they are stuck unless they can get their hands on a special oil that is not sold on the planet. Zegram points out that the oil comes from a special "Fire Fruit" native to Juraika, so he goes topside with Jaster and Kisala to find some Fire Fruit while the others make what repairs they can. As they venture through the jungle, Zegram notices that the Fire Fruit are strangely absent from the trees. Also, that they are heading near the territory of the Burkaqua Tribe native to Juraika, and are said to be hostile to outsiders. Nonetheless, Jaster decides to go seek their help, as they are out of other options.</p><p>The trio of pirates soon run into a Burkaqua tribeswoman talking with her sister, when a giant mutant frog attacks them all. Kisala manages to save the younger Burkaqua, but gets captured herself. After a grueling battle, the party defeats the beast and frees Kisala. As thanks the tribeswoman grants them access to her people's village. Also along the way, the pirates meet a strange tiny frog who hitches a ride with them in exchange for merging and improving their weapons.</p><p>As they reach the entrance to the village, the pirates discover that it has been shaken by a strange calamity, as one Burkaqua man dies right in front of them with strange dark lesions on his back.</p><h3>Chapter III - The Star God's Altar</h3><p>Jaster, Zegram and Kisala listen in on the village chief's council as he discusses the fate of their village. They have chosen to sacrifice Lilika's sister Iria to the "Star God" in order to stop the "Dark Fruit" that has been poisoning their people recently. Though Lilika has regrets about it, she decides to escort her sister to the altar the next morning. Zegram tells his comrades that they should be focusing on finding the Fire Fruit so they can repair their ship and escape Juraika, but Kisala and Jaster decide to stop the sacrifice instead, so Zegram grudgingly goes with them.</p><p>After a long trek and the discovery of some salvaged Zerardan technology, the party manages to reach the Altar of the Star God. However, Zegram disappears from the scene to communicate with an unknown party, so Jaster and Kisala continue ahead to rescue Iria. They find that the "Star God" is actually a giant beast, and Lilika soon recognizes that beast as the same one that killed her mother and blinded her sister. Enraged, she joins in attacking the beast until they manage to kill it.</p><p>For her actions against the Star God, the village chief banishes her from the tribe. Even though he knows the truth about the Star God, the council claims that the myth must remain even if the beast is dead. After leaving the village, Zegram returns to reveal that he acquired a canister full of the oil they need to finish repairing the Dorgenark. Lilika then appears on the path back to the ship and asks Jaster if she can go with them, to which he accepts.</p><h3>Chapter IV - The Great Escape</h3><p>With the Dorgenark repaired, the crew sets off for Zerard, the most technologically-advanced planet in the galaxy and home to the Longardia. The first mate gives Jaster a simple mission, to renew the Dorgenark's galactic travel visa. He sets out to reach the Galactic Headquarters with Simon and Lilika. However, upon arriving there, they find themselves blunted by the popular desk clerk Mio, when an explosion rocks the building. The guards immediately think that Jaster, Simon and Lilika are Draxian spies who planted the bomb, and throw them in Rosencaster Prison. Elsewhere, Zegram goes to work on his own personal mission, implying that he planted the bomb to frame his crewmates so they wouldn't interfere.</p><p>After meeting the titular warden of Rosencaster Prison, Jaster, Simon and Lilika are thrown into a cell on Level 4 when they meet an old cat-person who decides to break out of the cell with them. The group encounters a surprisingly-large amount of beasts within the prison walls as they make their way to the top to escape, including the large Salamander monster that Jaster killed back on Rosa. Eventually they find themselves in a room that shows Rosencaster has been using prisoners to conduct experiments in order to raise clone soldiers for Longardia, but also in hopes of finding a way to revive his dead wife Claudia. After fighting their way through Rosencaster himself, Jaster and his crew finally break free and return to the city, watching as the old cat-person leaves.</p><p>Making their way back to Galactic HQ, they discover that the cat-person was actually the Commander-in-Chief of the Longardian army who called for mutual disarmament with Draxia, and got thrown in a cell for his trouble. The party also stumbles across a mother and daughter looking for their missing husband. Simon abruptly decides to head back to the ship after seeing the photo, and subs in the robot Steve. When they go to get their galactic visa renewed, Mio tells them of a terrorist that has just taken over the Daytron mainframe, and no one can process their request until the situation is resolved, so Jaster, Steve and Lilika decide to take down the terrorist themselves.</p><h3>Chapter V - The Master Hacker</h3><p>As the party makes their way to the Daytron headquarters, they trick the security into letting them through by passing off Jaster as Desert Claw, letting him name his own reward for the successful capture of the terrorist Jupis Tooki. They enter the starship factory and fight their way through legions of security robots that have been hacked by Jupis to slow the party down. Eventually they rescue Dr. Poccaccio, another researcher who was also Steve's creator. The doctor begs the party to stop Jupis before any more damage is done.</p><p>Eventually the party comes face to face with Jupis himself, but Jupis pilots a large robot with an impenetrable barrier. However, Pocaccio shows up to give Jaster a pistol that can break through the barrier, and lets the party destroy Jupis's robot. Jupis finally gives up and explains why he hijacked the Daytron headquarters: he was on the verge of completing some important research project when his assistant stole his notes and sabotaged his computer, letting him take the blame for it. Rather than let himself get captured by Daytron security, Jupis tosses a smoke bomb and escapes. Pocaccio is able to reset the mainframe back to normal, and as thanks, Daytron lets Jaster use Pocaccio's factory to make whatever items he wants.</p><p>The party heads back to Galactic Headquarters for one last time, and Mio finally gives them a renewed galactic travel visa along with a membership card to her own fan club. They head back to the Dorgenark having finally accomplished their mission, only to find Jupis himself on board, still hiding from the local authorities. However, both the first mate and Kisala seem untroubled as they munch on some food that Jupis bribed them with, and let him stay.</p><p>Captain Dorgengoa himself shows up, an obese man chewing on a turkey leg (that Jupis also provided) to explain his master plan to the crew. He sees through Jaster's thinly-veiled attempt to pass himself off as the Desert Claw, having met the real Desert Claw before, but at his crew's pleading he allows Jaster to stay. He then reveals his plan to find the mythical lost planet of Eden that supposedly contains great treasure and the secret to eternal life, and says that one tablet that can lead to Eden was found on the planet Vedan, in the mining town of Myna.</p><h3>Chapter VI - The Guide</h3><p>As Jaster and Kisala head into Myna, they find themselves accosted by henchmen of local crimelord Dax Morarty, the man who supposedly has a lead on the tablet they are looking for. The two make their way to a local bar and find Deego, a muscular dog-person with a cybernetic arm and a former soldier, drinking his sorrows away. He decides to help the two of them find the mine that contains the tablet, but the group is impeded by his former comrade Gale. After picking up an ID card for the mine, the group discovers that someone has burned down the bar where Deego drank, but his girlfriend is fine.</p><p>Seeing the lengths that Gale would go to just to escape the planet, Deego decides to venture into the mine with Jaster and Kisala. Eventually, they find Gale waiting for him. Deego defeats him in a 1-on-1 fight, but Daytron manages to take the tablet before they can claim it. Deego decides to say goodbye to his girlfriend one last time before leaving with the crew of the Dorgenark. Meanwhile, Gale confronts Dax Morarty and manages to kill him for his treachery, but shortly after a former subordinate takes revenge on him as well.</p><h3>Chapter VII - Valkog's Ambition</h3><p>Daytron's CEO Valkog manages to sell the Longardian Empire on a new fleet of massive warships he dubs the Emperor class before returning to continue his plan to unite the tablets. Meanwhile, the Dorgenark has tracked the ship carrying the tablet from Myna back to Jaster's home planet of Rosa, so they land at the spaceport and decide to approach the ship on foot so as not to scare them into escaping again.</p><h2>Characters</h2><h3><a href="/jaster-rogue/3005-2875/" data-ref-id="3005-2875">Jaster Rogue</a></h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15495/1095641-jaster.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1095641" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.56719817767654" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15495/1095641-jaster.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1095641"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15495/1095641-jaster.jpg" alt="Jaster Rogue"></a><figcaption>Jaster Rogue</figcaption></figure><p>The main character of Rogue Galaxy who was raised as an orphan on the desert planet Rosa, which was conquered by the Longardian Empire.

The battle system in Rogue Galaxy is real time, except for the times in battle when you can pause and use items,abilities, or switch your party members. As you fight battles, you gain Experience Points for both the characters and their weapons. When the characters level up they just become stronger all around, and when your weapon is leveled up to the max, you can merge it with another weapon to make an even better weapon. ( See Weapon Customization for more details)</p><h3>Combat</h3><p>There are six damage forms in Rogue Galaxy: a primary attack, a charged primary attack, a secondary attack, a throwing attack, spell damage, and a combo attack. The primary and secondary attack are the use of the (usually) short range and long range weapons equipped to your player though some characters have differing primary weapon ranges. The charged primary occurs when the player presses and holds the primary attack button until a blue flame surround his character. This charged attack is more powerful and can be used to break through shielded enemies. Secondary attacks are often used to boss specific combat. For example, Jaster obtains a Freeze gun that allows him to make a particular boss fight more manageable. All weapons gain levels with the character and can be used to develop more advanced weapons (See Weapon Customization)</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2570/496769-rogue_galaxy_20060425025407253.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-496769" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="480" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2570/496769-rogue_galaxy_20060425025407253.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-496769"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Battle Screenshot, showing Jaster, Lillika and Zegram" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/2570/496769-rogue_galaxy_20060425025407253.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/2570/496769-rogue_galaxy_20060425025407253.jpg" alt="Battle Screenshot, showing Jaster, Lillika and Zegram"></noscript></a><figcaption>Battle Screenshot, showing Jaster, Lillika and Zegram</figcaption></figure><p>The throwing attack is the use of either background items or smaller enemies to inflict damage by hurling them into either a wall or another enemy. Throwing is the only command that can be done during the non-attack phase.</p><p>Spells in Rogue Galaxy are described as Abilities. Each character unlocks abilities by applying components collected throughout the game to a Final Fantasy 12-esque skill map. Abilities either cause damage to enemies, enhance player skills, or provide status bonuses to characters. One unlockable ability is a combo attack that the player can use when a combo meter fills. This attack requires the player to precisely time a series of button presses significant damage to the enemy.</p><h3>Weapon Customization</h3><p>Part way into the game, you obtain a little animal called 'Toady' who has magically gained the ability to speak and also combine two matured weapons into a third more usually more powerful weapon. When he joins your team (as a usable item in your items menu) you will gain the ability to perform this synthesis. A weapon synthesis can only occur for a primary or secondary weapon that has been completely leveled up. Toady gives two options when selected: "Analyze" and "Combine". Analyzing lets you determine the appropriate combination of matured weapons needed while combining actually performs the synthesis. Some of the time when you try to combine two weapons that are too similar, toady will give you a warning message, letting you re-think what you did.</p><h3>Item Creation (Factory Mini-Game)</h3><p>Item unlocking in Rogue Galaxy is handled through a Factory mini-game. Throughout the game players collect or purchase odd components used to level their character skills up (new spells, added status effects, etc). These same components are also used in the factory item creation mini-game. Before playing this mini-game the player must receive blueprints these are basically item recipes. A given recipes will call for a specified quantity of components. The "game" component applies in the manufacturing of the final item. Each component is given a specific category (metal, mineral, alchemy, etc) these components must be processed in special ways. For example, minerals must go through smelting, compressing, and cooling before they can be used. Each of the components are placed on a different assembly line path and the player must construct the appropriate processes before all the components are combined. The challenge comes in the timing of each process. Each process (e.g. smelting) takes a certain number of time units. The challenge with this game is to construct each assembly line such that all the required blueprint components will reach the final manufacturing stage simultaneously. This generally requires the use of special piping to slow the quicker processes down while the other components are going through their stages. After successfully completing a given blueprint, the item is purchasable at stores in the game. Several powerful in-game items are unlocked through this process.</p><h3>Party System</h3><p>Over the course of the game you can obtain a party of up to 8 characters, 3 of which that can be in your party at 1 time. While in Battle you can switch characters on the fly, issue commands to AI controlled party members, and use items without a wait time, making healing mid-battle quite a bit easier. During the game, while the characters in your immediate party gain the most experience, the ones that are on standby still gain experience, so you don't have to worry about anybody falling behind.</p><h3>Save System</h3><p>The save system in Rogue Galaxy is basically like any other JRPG, you can save at the points, and they heal your health. But in Rogue Galaxy, you can teleport from one save point to any other save point on that planet.

      <deck><![CDATA[Control Max, a young inventor, and Monica, a warrior princess from the future, as they fight their way through dungeons and train rides to save the world.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p>Dark Cloud 2, also known as Dark Chronicle, was developed by <a href="/level-5-inc/3010-1659/" data-ref-id="3010-1659">Level-5</a> and published by <a href="/sony-computer-entertainment-incorporated/3010-995/" data-ref-id="3010-995">Sony</a>. Just like its predecessor <a href="/dark-cloud/3030-1861/" data-ref-id="3030-1861">Dark Cloud</a>, the game is a <a href="/randomly-generated-dungeons/3015-167/" data-ref-id="3015-167">randomly-generated dungeon</a> <a href="/dungeon-crawling/3015-165/" data-ref-id="3015-165">crawler</a> with town building and weapon synthesis mechanics. New to the series is time-travel. The majority of the game is set in the past, where the player will have to meet certain conditions in order to restore the future to what it once was.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The difference between the first game is that if the player's weapon broke it was gone forever. This is not the case in the sequel, and now the player only loses experience. The player collects ABS points to level up their weapon improving their attack power and synthesis points. These are then used to merge with synth spheres to gain extra abilities. Weapon abilities include Attack, Flame, Lightning, Smash, Beast, Durable, Chill, Exorcism, Cyclone, and Scale. When all abilities have been met, players can build up their weapon, increasing its effectiveness while also altering its appearance.</p><p> As the story unfolds, Max and Monica gain more powerful weapons and abilities to aid them on their quest. New gameplay features that are introduced into the franchise are the ability to change or transform into a secondary character that can be used in dungeons. Max, as an inventor, brings his robot called Ridepod, a slow but formidable fire and defensive power. Ridepod can be upgraded by customizing different body parts from shops or inventing your own. Monica has the ability to transform into monsters, obtaining their special attack and the use of communicating with the same breed. Townsfolk can be brought to assist in dungeons as well. While they are not controlled directly, they offer items and abilities.</p><p>Though the game is primarlily focused on combat there is also a building aspect, as in the first Dark Cloud. The purpose of searching the dungeons is to gain Geostones. These Geostones are plans that are used to make houses, trees, fences, pots, benches and more. The player collects materials to construct these obtained plans, which is called the Georama system. Players can place their creations anywhere on the field, but the story will not develop if certain conditions aren't met. The purpose of re-building a town is to restore the future to what it once was.</p><p>New to the series is the introduction of Spheda. Similar to golf, the player uses a Spheda Rod to hit shards of space-time known as spheres back into the Time Distortion. Time Distortions and Spheres are either colored red or blue. The same colors repel each other, so a blue colored sphere will not go into a blue distortion. To change the color of the sphere, the player can hit it against the ground or walls to change the color.</p><h2>Playable Characters</h2><h3><a href="/maximillian/3005-5034/" data-ref-id="3005-5034"><b>Maximilion</b></a></h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/112/311820-dc003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-311820" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.413881748072" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:141.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/112/311820-dc003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-311820"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/112/311820-dc003.jpg" alt="Maximillon"></a><figcaption>Maximillon</figcaption></figure><p> </p><h3><a href="/monica/3005-4950/" data-ref-id="3005-4950"><b>Monica</b></a></h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/112/311837-dc018.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-311837" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.413881748072" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:141.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/112/311837-dc018.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-311837"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/112/311837-dc018.jpg" alt="Monica"></a><figcaption>Monica</figcaption></figure><p> </p><h3><a href="/steve/3005-18675/" data-ref-id="3005-18675">Ridepod A.K.A "Steve"</a></h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/123328/1708151-000332r01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1708151" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="300" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 300px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/123328/1708151-000332r01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1708151"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="The RIdepod in action" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/123328/1708151-000332r01.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/123328/1708151-000332r01.jpg" alt="The RIdepod in action"></noscript></a><figcaption>The RIdepod in action</figcaption></figure><p>The Ridepod (A.K.A "Steve) is "played character" that can be utilized by Max early in the game.

The Ridepod is used against certain bosses, along with some heavier trash that appear in dungeons.</p>]]></description>

      <deck><![CDATA[PaRappa the Rapper 2 is a PS2 rhythm game that follows PaRappa and his friends on a quest to save the world from  "Noodlization".]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>PaRappa the Rapper 2 is the sequel the Playstation's quirky music-rhythm game. The game continues the story of the lovable dog PaRappa and his girlfriend Sunny Funny. The gameplay uses timed button presses that are shown on a line at the top of the screen. The "Instructor" in each level will show you what buttons to press at each time and then you must copy him or her as close as possible. Another large feature of the game is the ability to freestyle. Instead of copying your instructor, you can press any combination of buttons that are in rhythm. The result of free styling can increase your in-game grade, which ranges from awful to cool. The only way to achieve the highest level, Cool, is to freestyle in rhythm. <br /><br />The story is about PaRappa winning a contest in which the prize is a lifetime supply of noodles. After having so many noodles, he is now very sick of them and wishes to eat another food. When his girlfriend Sunny makes him noodles, he runs away from her house and into the city. This sparks an inner conflict PaRappa has throughout the game about what it takes to be a man. Meanwhile, an evil villain is turning all of the world's foods into noodles, and it's up to PaRappa, his friend PJ, Sunny, and many more to save the world from "Noodlization". <br /><br />The game was not as well received as the original when it was released in January 2002. The complaint was that the sole game mechanic was becoming dated and the sequel did not change this mechanic enough. This was the last original PaRappa game that was created.</p>]]></description>

It is also one of the last games in the main series to use the original control scheme &amp; design, with <a href="/resident-evil-outbreak-file-2/3030-15222/" data-ref-id="3030-15222">Outbreak - File #2</a> being the very last.</p><p>It uses a team mechanic in which the player can control two characters in order to solve puzzles and defeat foes. A <a href="/wii/3045-36/" data-ref-id="3045-36">Nintendo Wii</a> version of the game was released in 2009 and features minimal changes, the main change being that the game can be controlled with the <a href="/wii-remote/3055-1304/" data-ref-id="3055-1304">Wiimote</a>. It was originally slated to come out for the <a href="/nintendo-64/3045-43/" data-ref-id="3045-43">Nintendo 64</a> and up until 2016 was a Nintendo exclusive, before it was remastered for Sony and Microsoft consoles, and the PC.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Overview &amp; Controls</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2756622-44dcf011fb2d3585e949d5c639bda78c.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2756622" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2756622-44dcf011fb2d3585e949d5c639bda78c.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2756622"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2756622-44dcf011fb2d3585e949d5c639bda78c.jpg" alt="2756622-44dcf011fb2d3585e949d5c639bda78c.jpg"></a></figure><p>Resident Evil Zero plays much like every other Resident Evil game pre-Resident Evil 4, mixing in third-person combat, exploration, and puzzles. Though like most survival horror titles, Resident Evil limits the player character's capabilities beyond the norm and ammunition for their firearms is generally scarce, intended to force players to use their supplies wisely and to choose flight rather than fight when possible. There are three different difficulty modes available: Easy, Normal, and Hard, with each one featuring tougher enemies and less ammunition to be found than the last.</p><p>By default Zero utilises the notorious '<a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/tank-controls/3015-4647/" data-ref-id="3015-4647">tank controls</a>' as players move via a third-person perspective throughout a number of pre-determined camera angles. Characters also cannot move and fire their weapons at the same time, and instead the character will 'perch' themselves to the ground when aiming. And while the camera angle perspective sometimes tends to purposely obfuscate the player's view of monsters, characters will at least (by default) aim their weapon at the closest enemy when players draw their gun. Simultaneously hitting down and the 'run' button will have the player character do a 180 degree turn, as is custom with Resident Evil games since <a href="/resident-evil-3-nemesis/3030-5587/" data-ref-id="3030-5587">Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</a>.</p><p>The story is largely portrayed via in-game cutscenes, however there are also a number of Files (diaries, memos ect.) players can collect. These will often provide additional insight into the goings on across the overall narrative, but some are more vital as they will provide information pertaining to solving puzzles or maybe hinting as to where to go next.</p><h3>Cooperative Functions</h3><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2756624-552c7b8c215efe3bff1609c84aa050e8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2756624" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2756624-552c7b8c215efe3bff1609c84aa050e8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2756624"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2756624-552c7b8c215efe3bff1609c84aa050e8.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2756624-552c7b8c215efe3bff1609c84aa050e8.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2756624-552c7b8c215efe3bff1609c84aa050e8.jpg" alt="2756624-552c7b8c215efe3bff1609c84aa050e8.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>Zero's one primary component that separates it from previous games of the series is its two-protagonist setup--being Rebecca Chambers &amp; Billy Coen--each of whom can be controlled by the player. When controlling one the other will follow closely by default and will attack any encroaching enemies - though it will use up any ammo it has access to in the process. It will also fire alongside the player at whatever enemy they're targeted at, though its frequency of attack is rather slow. Such behaviour related to its attacking and following procedures can be turned off, so it will merely follow the player without engaging in combat and/or will wait on the spot. When travelling together the player can control the movement of the alternate character as well with the c-stick/right analogue stick (default GameCube/PlayStation &amp; Xbox controls), though the secondary character will only run via this method and cannot walk.</p><p>Rather than having both characters following one another, players can also split them up. When split up the secondary character will await in the area they're left in until the player takes control, though they're still vulnerable to attack should there be any nearby enemies. If the secondary character is being attacked then the player will receive a warning over their radio; if players don't switch to the alternate character to save them, there's a high chance they may perish. This function is forced upon the player so as to solve certain puzzles, such as by having one character access an area that only he/she can travel to, while the other sends key items and/or supplies via a dumbwaiter.</p><p>While the majority of the game plays out with these mechanics in play, there are two occasions where the characters are separated without the ability to switch between the two for the sake of the story. One sequence forces players to play as Billy, while another, much longer segment has players play as Rebecca on her own.</p><h3>Playable Characters</h3><p>Both Rebecca and Billy each have their own strengths and weaknesses to help distinguish the two. Due to his experience in the marines, Billy is significantly more durable than Rebecca and can withstand more damage before dying. His strength also allows him to interact with certain objects that Rebecca cannot, though the opposite is also true for Rebecca who can access certain areas that Billy cannot due to her smaller size.</p><p>Though Rebecca can't withstand nearly as much punishment as Billy, she is the only one of the two who can mix herbs, making Billy quite literally the only playable characters in the series who cannot mix herbs together. Her medicine case that she uses to mix herbs is also used for mixing certain chemicals to solve puzzles.</p><p>All weapons in the game can be used by both characters largely to the same effect.</p><h3>Inventory</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2768250-img-37.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2768250" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2768250-img-37.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2768250"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2768250-img-37.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2768250-img-37.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2768250-img-37.jpg" alt="2768250-img-37.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>The inventory system for Zero received a slight overhaul from previous games. Each of the two characters has their own six-slot inventory, to which they can trade items between each other at will so long as they're in the same room. However there are no <a href="/item-box/3055-6126/" data-ref-id="3055-6126">item boxes</a> to be found in the game. Instead players can opt to drop items onto the ground, to which will persist there until/if it is collected. Any dropped items will also show up on the map.</p><p>Each character has their own personal item that's housed in a separate inventory slot - no other items can be exchanged into this slot. Rebecca has her medicine case, while Billy has a lighter.</p><p>All items and weapons can be examined by the player, allowing them to get a closer look and turn the object around. This can sometimes change the properties of certain key items, such as unlocking/opening a key item to reveal another inside, or may at least change the title to reflect the item's true identity.</p><p>Most items and weapons take up a single inventory slot, however there are a select few that require two to carry. These are:</p><ul><li>Hunting Gun</li><li>Shotgun</li><li>Grenade Launcher</li><li>Hookshot</li><li>Rocket Launcher</li></ul><h3>Health &amp; Herbs/First Aid Sprays</h3><p>A character's health can be seen via the inventory menu, with an Electrocardiograph Machine showing a character's status. The different statuses are:</p><ul><li><strong>Fine</strong> - The character is in good health.</li><li><strong>Caution</strong> - The character is roughly at half health.</li><li><strong>Danger</strong> - The character is approaching death.</li><li><strong>Poison</strong> - The character is poisoned and their health will slowly deplete.</li></ul><p>Besides the EKG, players may also note the character's stance. Whence the characters starts holding onto their hip, that is a sign that their health is at least in the Caution state, or may even be poisoned.</p><p>Carrying the tradition set by the original Resident Evil, characters use a small variety of <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/medical-herb/3055-566/" data-ref-id="3055-566">herb</a>s to heal themselves and cure poisons. Though as mentioned before only Rebecca can mix herbs. <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/first-aid-spray/3055-619/" data-ref-id="3055-619">First Aid Spray</a>s are also available, though they only have the singular purpose of healing the character fully. There exist three herb types, all of which can be combined in some way for different degrees of healing:</p><ul><li><b>Green Herb</b> - On its own will restore 25% of health.</li><li><b>Blue Herb</b> - On its own will cure poison, though will not restore any health.</li><li><b>Red Herb</b> - On its own does nothing.</li><li><b>Green + Green Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character by roughly 50% of health.</li><li><b>Green + Green + Green Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character completely, though not of any poisons.</li><li><b>Green + Blue Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character 25% of health and cure any poison.</li><li><b>Green + Green + Blue Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character 50% of health and cure any poison.</li><li><b>Green + Red Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character completely, though not of any poisons.</li><li><b>Green + Red + Blue Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character completely including poisons.</li><li><b>Red + Blue Herb</b> - Mixed will do nothing.</li></ul><h3>Saving</h3><p>Like every other main Resident Evil game pre-Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil Zero requires that players find one of the many typewriters located throughout the environments to save, and must also have at least one ink ribbon item in their character's inventory. However whereas Save Rooms would always be devoid of enemies in previous games, this isn't the case for Zero.</p><p> </p><h2>Story</h2><h3>Main Characters</h3><h4>Rebecca Chambers</h4><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2757999----render2---a3uch.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2757999" data-ratio="2.24125" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:224.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2757999----render2---a3uch.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2757999"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2757999----render2---a3uch.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2757999----render2---a3uch.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2757999----render2---a3uch.jpg" alt="2757999----render2---a3uch.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>The youngest member of STARS at only eighteen and one of two protagonists, Rebecca serves as the medic for Bravo team.

The S.T.A.R.S. Bravo team is dispatched to the <a href="/arklay-mountains/3035-387/" data-ref-id="3035-387">Arklay Mountains</a> to investigate and find the cause of the murders that have recently occurred. While over the forest the Bravo team's helicopter is mysteriously forced to crash land. Upon leaving the crash site, the Bravo team discovers an overturned Military Police vehicle, as well as orders for the transport of a prisoner to be executed.</p><p>Rookie team medic <a href="/rebecca-chambers/3005-1306/" data-ref-id="3005-1306">Rebecca Chambers</a> discovers the Ecliptic Express stopped and without power in the middle of the forest. Upon entering the train, Rebecca encounters numerous zombies, and infected canine. Pressing further throughout the train, Rebecca meet <a href="/billy-coen/3005-3137/" data-ref-id="3005-3137">Billy Coen</a>, the prisoner that was being transported to his execution. With little control over the recent events, Rebecca reluctantly agrees to team up with Billy, to get to safer ground, still vowing to bring him into custody if they both make it out alive. Further exploring Billy and Rebecca meet what appears to be a possible survivor, but before getting too close they find out it is a humanoid leech. Billy disposes of the leech creature, afterwords they see a lone man outside of the train standing on a cliff who appears to have some sort of control over the leeches. Unable to identify the mysterious individual, they must find a way to restore power to the train and get out of the forest. Once, power is finally returned to the locomotive, the train speeds to an unknown destination and eventually derails.</p><p>Seemingly unscathed from the train crash Rebecca and Billy end up at the trains destination. The mansion like building, is actually revealed to be a training facility for new employees of the <a href="/umbrella-corporation/3015-204/" data-ref-id="3015-204">Umbrella Corporation</a>, and upon entering they are welcomed with a pre-recorded message from the head of the facility, <a href="/james-marcus/3005-4575/" data-ref-id="3005-4575">James Marcus</a>. During their trek through the training facility the pair is face with numerous zombies as well as plenty of new abominations. Over the course of their time together, Rebecca begins to see that Billy isn't a quite the criminal type, and begins to wonder why he was sentenced to be executed. The two eventually discover an underground portion of the training facility and are separated when the floor that Rebecca is standing on collapses. After being rescued by Billy, she questions him about what he did to get the sentence he had been handed. Billy finally explains, that he was part of the <a href="/united-states-marine-corps/3015-2241/" data-ref-id="3015-2241">USMC</a> (United States Marine Corps) and during a mission in Africa, his commanding officer ordered them to exterminate civilians of an African village that was suffering from a civil war. Billy refused to follow the orders, and once the information proved to be false, the slaughter was blamed entirely on him.</p><p>Upon entering an abandoned sewage treatment plant, the duo encounter James Marcus. Marcus, had been monitoring Coen and Chamber's progress throughout the training facility as well as the other areas they visited. Marcus reveals that a decade ago <a href="/ozwell-e-spencer/3005-10018/" data-ref-id="3005-10018">Lord Ozwell E. Spencer</a> has Marcus assassinated, in the midst of the research on his leech research. He explains that the Queen leech from his experiments crawled into his mouth after he was shot, and the T-Virus that the leech was injected with was able to resurrect Marcus. Midway through his speech, the Queen leech takes over Marcus' body, and causes him to mutate into a new type of leech monstrosity. After toppling the Queen leech, Rebecca and Billy escape the training facility just as it is rocked by a gigantic explosion. After the escape, Rebecca takes Billy's dog tags as "proof" that he didn't survive the incident, and then the pair amicably part ways. In the distance Rebecca is able to see the <a href="/spencer-mansion/3035-563/" data-ref-id="3035-563">Spencer mansion</a>.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><h3>Knife</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2819453-chris_redfield_knife_2_by_james_miller-d2yemoq.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2819453" data-ratio="0.75185185185185" data-width="270" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 270px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2819453-chris_redfield_knife_2_by_james_miller-d2yemoq.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2819453"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2819453-chris_redfield_knife_2_by_james_miller-d2yemoq.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2819453-chris_redfield_knife_2_by_james_miller-d2yemoq.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2819453-chris_redfield_knife_2_by_james_miller-d2yemoq.jpg" alt="2819453-chris_redfield_knife_2_by_james_miller-d2yemoq.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>Considered to be a last resort tactic, the knife does very little damage and has dangerously small reach.

Slow and sluggish in movement, but dangerous up close, zombies are durable enough against gunfire that they can prove to be extremely dangerous even just in small numbers, especially due to the typically claustrophobic environments. When encountered on their own, however, zombies can be dispatched relatively easy so long as the player has enough ammunition to spare. As per usual, zombies are best dealt with the pistol or sometimes the shotgun, which can kill a zombie with a single shot if the player aims directly at its head once close enough, or can at least reduce the zombie to a literal crawl by destroying its legs.</p><p>Zombies attack by grabbing and biting the player when close, but will also puke out acid instead if they can't quite reach the player. Some zombies will be encountered lying on the ground, seemingly pretending to be dead, and will grab at a character's leg should the player get close enough. However, the leg bite does little damage and will always result in the character killing the zombie with a single stomp or kick.</p><h3>Cerberus Dogs</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2768794-re0cerberus.png" data-ref-id="1300-2768794" data-ratio="1.6523297491039" data-width="279" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 279px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:165.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2768794-re0cerberus.png" data-ref-id="1300-2768794"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2768794-re0cerberus.png" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2768794-re0cerberus.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2768794-re0cerberus.jpg" alt="2768794-re0cerberus.png"></noscript></a></figure><p>Alongside regular zombies, some sort of iteration surrounding infected dogs have persisted across nearly every Resident Evil game to date. Starting at the beginning, so to speak, the Cerberus Dogs of Resident Evil Zero are infected Doberman breeds, purposely engineered to be a form of B.O.W. Cerberus dogs retain the same agility and tenacity as a regular dog, though with a massive increase in aggressiveness, brutality, and stamina.</p><p>Like zombies, Cerberus dogs are best left for lesser weaponry like the pistols and shotguns. Running past is always an option as well, as both Rebecca and Billy are just ever so slightly faster than the canines. However their attacks can sometimes cover just enough distance to close the gap and catch the player character.</p><p>Unlike other games in the series, there are only four dogs the player will encounter throughout the game, all of which are located in the beginning Ecliptic Express section.</p><h3>Crows</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2768795-crowre0_0.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2768795" data-ratio="1.0733944954128" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:107.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2768795-crowre0_0.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2768795"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2768795-crowre0_0.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2768795-crowre0_0.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2768795-crowre0_0.jpg" alt="2768795-crowre0_0.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>As always, crows prove to be more of a nuisance than a genuine threat. They do minimal damage and can often be killed with a single bullet; their numbers are always many, however. Sometimes a shotgun blast might be worth it to take a pack down, but otherwise they're best just ignored.</p><p>They only have one attack by way of pecking at the player, which while does little damage will keep the player stuck in a short animation of trying to wave them off.</p><h3>Bats</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2768828-bats2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2768828" data-ratio="0.85625" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:85.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2768828-bats2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2768828"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2768828-bats2.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2768828-bats2.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2768828-bats2.jpg" alt="2768828-bats2.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>Somewhat similar to crows, bats also function more so to harass than pose any serious threat.

Always encountered in groups, they can crawl along walls like any other spider, and will often try to charge forward and bite players when given the opportunity. However, their greatest weapon is their poison spit, which they will routinely spray; it has a fairly long reach of attack and has a high chance of poisoning the player, though the base damage it inflicts isn't quite as alarming.</p><p>Web Spinners have surprisingly tough hides and are most susceptible to the Grenade Launcher - specifically when equipped with flame rounds. They will also often strafe once they've been shot and attempt to counter the player as such. If a Web Spinner is killed with its sack intact, a large multitude of baby spiders will seep out of the corpse and attack the player. Though their damage is even less than that of a crow and should the player leave the area, they will return to find them all gone.</p><h3>Eliminator</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2818508-re0_eliminators.png" data-ref-id="1300-2818508" data-ratio="0.9180790960452" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:91.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2818508-re0_eliminators.png" data-ref-id="1300-2818508"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2818508-re0_eliminators.png" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2818508-re0_eliminators.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2818508-re0_eliminators.jpg" alt="2818508-re0_eliminators.png"></noscript></a></figure><p>Eliminators are an infected breed of monkeys that are exceptionally fast and agile, somewhat akin to Hunters. However they are also rather small to boot, so should they happen to get close enough the player must then aim downwards to get a shot. Their main two attacks are to rapidly slash at the player when close, and to leap through the air and slash from afar. They are still vulnerable amidst their leaping animation, however, providing the player with an opportunity to show them down if they can react fast enough. Eliminators are rarely encountered alone, and if a group of two to three swarms the player they can prove to be highly difficult to escape without taking damage.</p><p>Despite their small size they're still rather sturdy. The handgun is outright useless--that is besides to potentially finish them off after already being weakened--as they shrug the bullets off completely and will continue their advance.

The concept is that Billy and Rebecca must collect a certain amount of color-coded, leech-themed jewellery pieces before exiting out the Umbrella Research Facility front door. When collecting leeches it can only be done specifically for each character, blue for Billy and green for Rebecca, but they cannot swap using the exchange system or pick up the opposite color for their team mate. The unlockable costumes as noted above are available to wear in Leech Hunter as well.</p><p>There are a number of unlockable rewards available for the main game, which are unlocked depending on how many leech pieces the player collects upon exiting the facility. If one of the character dies then the player's progress is forfeited. A list of the rewards is as such:</p><ul><li><strong>0-29</strong> - Submachine gun ammo.</li><li><strong>30-59</strong> - Infinite handgun ammunition.</li><li><strong>60-89</strong> - Infinite Hunting Gun ammunition.</li><li><strong>90-99</strong> - Magnum Revolver is added for collection in Second Class Private Room B.</li><li><strong>100</strong> - Infinite ammunition for all weapons.</li></ul><h2>HD Remastered Port</h2><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2756620-0e798a16a73b97bdd754714dc33f802f.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2756620" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2756620-0e798a16a73b97bdd754714dc33f802f.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2756620"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2756620-0e798a16a73b97bdd754714dc33f802f.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2756620-0e798a16a73b97bdd754714dc33f802f.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2756620-0e798a16a73b97bdd754714dc33f802f.jpg" alt="2756620-0e798a16a73b97bdd754714dc33f802f.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>Following the success of the <a href="/resident-evil/3030-27715/" data-ref-id="3030-27715">Resident Evil</a> remake remastering, a similar such remastering was announced for Resident Evil Zero on May 26th, 2015 for an early 2016 release.

In it Billy Coen is replaced by notorious series antagonist Albert Wesker, depicted in his <a href="/resident-evil-5/3030-20569/" data-ref-id="3030-20569">Resident Evil 5</a> attire. Rebecca is still in tow as a fellow protagonist, now wearing a new, darker outfit as well as the same type of jewel that allowed Wesker to brainwash <a href="/jill-valentine/3005-626/" data-ref-id="3005-626">Jill Valentine</a> into doing his bidding for him in Resident Evil 5. While D.C. Douglas returns to provide a few new lines of dialogue for telling Rebecca to follow or wait, all of the cutscenes instead simply feature Billy's dialogue coming out of Wesker.</p><p>Though mechanically speaking Wesker is more than just a simple character skin and has access to two unique abilities. First is a super-sprint, to which he can use to effortlessly rush past enemies, and the second is a kind of eye blast. The eye blast can be charged up for extra power, though even when at its lowest charge can make all of the zombies' heads within the vicinity explode. Rebecca does not gain any new abilities of her own, however, and neither character can change into any alternate outfits for this mode.</p><p>Wesker mode is played within the Normal setting.</p><h3>DLC Costumes</h3><p>RE0's Remastered version contains a number of new purchasable costumes for players to wear in the game. Two of which were given for free for preordering the game, while another two were awarded for preordering for <a href="/resident-evil-origins-collection/3030-50713/" data-ref-id="3030-50713">Resident Evil: Origins Collection</a>. All costumes can be bought together as a bundle, however this is the only means by which to purchase the preorder outfits, which aren't sold separately.</p><p>None of the new costumes are originally designed for RE0, and instead originate across a number of classic Capcom games and Resident Evil game ports. A list of the new costumes and their origins is as such:</p><h3>Rebecca Chambers</h3><h4>STARS 1996</h4><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/10354/2816261-reb2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2816261" data-ratio="1.69125" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:169.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/10354/2816261-reb2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2816261"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2816261-reb2.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2816261-reb2.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2816261-reb2.jpg" alt="2816261-reb2.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>This is Rebecca's very original costume from the 1996 <a href="/resident-evil/3030-5842/" data-ref-id="3030-5842">Resident Evil</a>.

When selecting the game's Arranged Mode, Chris, Jill, and Rebecca are shown to wear alternate outfits to their regular RE attire, this being Rebecca's.</p><h4>Sportswear</h4><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/10354/2804814-residentevilzero-10.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2804814" data-ratio="1.5477629987908" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:154.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/10354/2804814-residentevilzero-10.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2804814"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2804814-residentevilzero-10.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2804814-residentevilzero-10.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2804814-residentevilzero-10.jpg" alt="2804814-residentevilzero-10.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>This outfit is perhaps Rebecca's most obscure, as she's only been shown to wear such an outfit in <a href="/resident-evil-2/3030-9418/" data-ref-id="3030-9418">Resident Evil 2</a>. Specifically in a secret photo players can find by examining Albert Wesker's desk in the STARS office fifty consecutive times.</p><h4>Cheerleader</h4><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2818729-resident-evil-0-hd-cheerleader-rebecca.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2818729" data-ratio="1.6763888888889" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:167.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2818729-resident-evil-0-hd-cheerleader-rebecca.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2818729"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2818729-resident-evil-0-hd-cheerleader-rebecca.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2818729-resident-evil-0-hd-cheerleader-rebecca.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2818729-resident-evil-0-hd-cheerleader-rebecca.jpg" alt="2818729-resident-evil-0-hd-cheerleader-rebecca.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>As with her 1997 STARS uniform, this outfit is first showcased in another of the original Resident Evil's many ports. Specifically <a href="/resident-evil-deadly-silence/3030-377/" data-ref-id="3030-377">Deadly Silence</a> from 2006. Rebecca will wear this outfit should players select the alternate Ninja outfit for Chris once it's unlocked.

Development of Resident Evil Zero began in the Summer of 1998.</p><p>Much of what was developed for the prototype persists in the full retail release, such as the two-protagonist setup of Rebecca &amp; Billy, it beginning on the Ecliptic Express train, and the death of Edward as he leaps through the window. Though there are certain features planned for the prototype that never made it into the full game; most notably is how one of the two protagonists could die, but the game wouldn't end unless both Rebecca &amp; Billy perish. This idea was scrapped due to how Rebecca canonically dying would conflict against her appearance in the original Resident Evil. 'Running zombies' was another idea that was scrapped for RE0, though would pave the way for the design of the Crimson Heads in the Resident Evil remake.</p><p>During development for Zero's remastered release, Capcom released footage of RE0's prototype version to the public. It was shown to still be using the zombie moan fxs from Resident Evil 2, likely due to Resident Evil 2 being ported to the N64 years before. Billy's voice actor is also noted as the same one that would voice him in the full release.</p><p>Weirdly enough Rebecca is also shown to be wearing a beret, which is more so recognizable as the iconic hat of choice for Jill Valentine in her STARS uniform. There also exists concept art of Rebecca wearing a beret as well, despite the fact that she has never been depicted wearing such an item before in the series. Though it's possible that she was to lose the beret during the events of RE0. Nonetheless, she was once again designed to be beret-less for the full GameCube release.</p>]]></description>

After being ejected from a number of schools, Jimmy ends up at <a href="/bullworth-academy/3035-83/" data-ref-id="3035-83">Bullworth Academy</a>, a private school modeled largely after the ostensibly prestigious private schools. The main storyline in Bully concerns Jimmy's dealings with the various cliques and faculty within the school, as well as a <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/sociopath/3015-3728/" data-ref-id="3015-3728">sociopathic</a> student named <a href="/gary-smith/3005-281/" data-ref-id="3005-281">Gary Smith</a>.</p><p>A 1080p version of the game with added trophy support was released on PS4 on March 22nd, 2016.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9775/253990-bully2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-253990" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.7" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:70.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9775/253990-bully2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-253990"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9775/253990-bully2.jpg" alt="Jimmy getting caught by a prefect"></a><figcaption>Jimmy getting caught by a prefect</figcaption></figure><p>The gameplay in Bully draws from many of <a href="/rockstar-games/3010-1194/" data-ref-id="3010-1194">Rockstar</a>'s previous games, particularly <a href="/grand-theft-auto/3025-6/" data-ref-id="3025-6">Grant Theft Auto</a>. Additionally, the new targeting system and combat system of Bully is similar to that of the <a href="/manhunt/3025-502/" data-ref-id="3025-502">Manhunt</a> games. A unique part of the gameplay is the mini-games that occur when Jimmy attends class. Completing the mini-games, such as dodgeball in Gym or word creation in English, gives Jimmy abilities that help him in regular gameplay. In addition to the seemingly loose gameplay, there are some limits placed that are similar to those that a real 15-year-old boy would face. For example, unlike the adult protagonists of the <i>Grand Theft Auto</i> series, if Jimmy stays up too late, he will pass out from exhaustion, encouraging the player to go to bed before that happens.</p><p>While comparisons to Rockstar's successful Grand Theft Auto franchise are apt from a mechanical and a thematic perspective, Bully is smaller in scope than your typical GTA, with a lighter tone and more low key violence - anyone defeated by Jimmy is merely knocked out of commission, not killed, and will be fine the next time he sees them. But, due to the publisher's history, as well as the relatively sensitive nature of school violence, Bully received a great deal of media attention leading up to its release, with media watchdogs expressing concern over its potential glamorization of bullying. It was for this reason that in Europe the game was published under the alternate title Canis Canem Edit, Latin for "dog eat dog", the motto of Bullworth Academy. Generally speaking, though, Bully is a game that condemns bullying, as most of the story is spent overthrowing the established pecking order at Bullworth Academy.</p><p>Bully was originally released on the <a href="/playstation-2/3045-19/" data-ref-id="3045-19">PlayStation 2</a>, though a special enhanced edition eventually came to both the <a href="/xbox-360/3045-20/" data-ref-id="3045-20">Xbox 360</a>, <a href="/wii/3045-36/" data-ref-id="3045-36">Nintendo Wii</a>, and <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC</a> under the title <a href="/bully-scholarship-edition/3030-5092/" data-ref-id="3030-5092">Bully: Scholarship Edition</a>.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>Jimmy Hopkins, a badly behaved 15 year old, is sent to Bullworth Academy, one of the worst private schools in America, after his mother and stepfather begin their year-long honeymoon. He immediately notices that the school is in a huge mess and needs to be sorted out, everyone is sorted into cliques and pranks are being pulled all over the place. Throughout the game Jimmy befriends the different sets of cliques and helps them with a variety of tasks.</p><p>The story is divided into 6 chapters:</p><ul><li><b>Chapter 1: Making New Friends and Enemies:</b> Jimmy, having just arrived at Bullworth Academy, meets Gary Smith for the first time and must take down the Bullies</li><li><b>Chapter 2: Rich Kid Blues:</b> Jimmy must get the Preppies on his side</li><li><b>Chapter 3: Love Makes the World Go Around:</b> As snow begins to cover the ground and Christmas draws near, Jimmy must deal with the Greasers and a certain girl who is cheating on the leader of the clique</li><li><b>Chapter 4: A Healthy Mind in a Healthy Body and Other Lies:</b> Jimmy needs to convince the nerds to help him defeat the Jocks</li><li><b>Chapter 5: The Fall and Rise of Jimmy Hopkins, Aged 15:</b> Things take a turn for the worse after Jimmy becomes king of the school and he needs to find out what is going on and who is behind</li><li><b>Chapter 6: Endless Summer:</b> With his antagonist out of the way, Jimmy is free to roam around the town and do whatever he wants.</li></ul><h2>Classes</h2><p>There are 5 lessons for each of the 6 classes, if the player fails a class they can come back and try the class again. There is a set timetable and the player can only attend classes in the correct time period, skipping a class will alert prefects, teachers and police.</p><h3>English</h3><p>The player will be provided with a set of letters and must make as many words as possible from the letters.</p><h3>Art</h3><p>The player must guide a pencil around a rectangular canvas and section off bits of the drawing avoiding enemies that will force the player to lose a life when touched. Art lessons are a lot like the arcade game, <a href="/qix/3030-6136/" data-ref-id="3030-6136">Qix</a>.</p><h3>Chemistry</h3><p>Similar to Music lessons however much easier because you have more time to press the buttons, simply press the correct button as it passes across the line.</p><h3>Photography</h3><p>The player is given a camera and needs to take photos of set places/objects. For example one of the Photography classes requires the player to take pictures of all the flags on the Bullworth premises.</p><h3>Gym</h3><p>There are two different types of Gym lessons. The first one is wrestling, the player has to hit certain buttons to perform fighting combos and they must then use them on the opponent. When a lesson is finished the player can then use those moves at any time. The second type of Gym lesson is dodgeball, Jimmy is placed on the same team as the nerds and needs to beat the opposing team at dodgeball.</p><h3>Shop</h3><p>The player needs to perform the moves on the controller that appear on the screen. Timing and accuracy are essential in this one; this is possibly the hardest class and many players had troubles with this class.</p><h2>Characters</h2><p>Bully involves many memorable characters throughout the experience. The game revolves around the main character Jimmy Hopkins whom encounters a range of different personalities. Jimmy can interact with a range of different cliques, teachers, prefects and citizens. Some of the key characters in Bully are;</p><p><a href="/jimmy-hopkins/3005-229/" data-ref-id="3005-229">Jimmy Hopkins</a></p><p><a href="/gary-smith/3005-281/" data-ref-id="3005-281">Gary Smith</a></p><p><a href="/pete-kowalski/3005-147/" data-ref-id="3005-147">Pete Kowalski</a></p><p><a href="/russell-northrop/3005-9924/" data-ref-id="3005-9924">Russell Northrop</a></p><p><a href="/derby-harrington/3005-9925/" data-ref-id="3005-9925">Derby Harrington</a></p><p><a href="/ted-thompson/3005-9923/" data-ref-id="3005-9923">Ted Thompson</a></p><p><a href="/johnny-vincent/3005-1853/" data-ref-id="3005-1853">Johnny Vincent</a></p><p><a href="/earnest-jones/3005-9926/" data-ref-id="3005-9926">Earnest Jones</a></p><p><a href="/edgar-munsen/3005-9927/" data-ref-id="3005-9927">Edgar Munsen</a></p><p><a href="/zoe/3005-3762/" data-ref-id="3005-3762">Zoe Taylor</a></p><p><a href="/dr-crabblesnitch/3005-9922/" data-ref-id="3005-9922">Dr.Crabblesnitch</a></p><h2>Cliques</h2><p>Bullworth Academy is home to six different cliques, listed below.</p><h3>The Bullies</h3><p>Bullies get joy out of beating younger kids to a pulp and taunting the Townies. This all-male clique can be recognized by their denim jeans and white untucked shirts. Their leader is <a href="/russell-northrop/3005-9924/" data-ref-id="3005-9924">Russell Northrop</a>.</p><h3>The Nerds</h3><p>Nerds are the most intelligent kids in school, they mainly hang out in the library and have a talent in making stink bombs, itching powder and other various weapons. They are often bullied by the other cliques, especially the Jocks who love to stuff the Nerds into lockers and trash cans. Their leader is <a href="/earnest-jones/3005-9926/" data-ref-id="3005-9926">Earnest Jones</a>.</p><h3>The Preppies</h3><p>Preppies are the rich, snobby kids of the school. They wear more expensive, nicer uniforms and are usually found in Harrington House or in the local boxing gym. They believe that they are above everyone else in the world and have a love for boxing. Their leader is <a href="/derby-harrington/3005-9925/" data-ref-id="3005-9925">Derby Harrington</a>. By going to the boxing gym the player can take on 4 seperate matches against the preps, each victory results in a permanent increase to punching damage.</p><h3>The Jocks</h3><p>Jocks are the toughest kids in school and love to bully other people, especially the Nerds. They are very athletic people and can often be found at the back of the school in the gym or on the football field. Their leader is <a href="/ted-thompson/3005-9923/" data-ref-id="3005-9923">Ted Thompson</a>.</p><h3>The Greasers</h3><p>Greasers are the poor kids in school who usually live in trailers or worn down houses. They are tough and all of them wear leather jackets and hang around the auto shop. They love to engineer cars and race bikes. Their leader is <a href="/johnny-vincent/3005-1853/" data-ref-id="3005-1853">Johnny Vincent</a>.</p><h3>The Townies</h3><p>Townies don't actually attend Bullworth but they hate the students that do. They live in the far side of town and if you visit them, they will be far from happy about it. Their leader is <a href="/edgar-munsen/3005-9927/" data-ref-id="3005-9927">Edgar Munsen</a>.</p><h2>Collectibles</h2><h3>Rubber bands</h3><p>Scattered around the game world in <i>Bully</i> are rubber bands. After completing the class ‘Geography 2’ these show up on the map in the game menu. For collecting all 75 of these the player is rewarded with a rubber band ball, which can be used in combat.</p><h3>‘Grottos and Gremlins’ Cards</h3><p>After completing the class ‘Geography 3’, these show up on the map in the game menu. After collecting all 40 of these, the player is rewarded with a ‘Grottos and Gremlins’ based costume.</p><h3>Gnomes</h3><p>Located around the game world are lawn gnomes, which can be smashed. After completing ‘Geography 5’, they will show up on the map in the game menu. For smashing all 25 of these, the player is rewarded with a gnome outfit.</p><h3>Transistors</h3><p>They can be given to the old homeless man behind the unused school bus in Bullworth Academy in exchange for fighting lessons. In these lessons you learn new, more powerful moves. There are a total of 6 transistors to collect.</p><h2>Levels</h2><p><b>Chapter 1: Making New Friends and Enemies</b></p><ul><li>This is Your School</li><li>The Setup</li><li>Slingshot</li><li>A Little Help</li><li>Save Algie</li><li>That Bitch</li><li>The Diary</li><li>Defend Bucky</li><li>The Candidate</li><li>Halloween</li><li>The Big Prank</li><li>Character Sheets</li><li>Help Gary</li><li>Russell in the Hole</li></ul><p><b>Chapter 2: Rich Kid Blues</b></p><ul><li>Last Minute Shopping</li><li>Hattrick vs. Galloway</li><li>Prep Challenge</li><li>The Eggs</li><li>Movie Tickets</li><li>Carnival Date</li><li>Panty Raid</li><li>Race the Vale</li><li>Beach Rumble</li><li>Tad's House</li><li>Weed Killer</li><li>Boxing Challenge</li><li>Dishonorable Fight</li></ul><p><b>Chapter 3: Love Makes the World Go Around</b></p><ul><li>Christmas Is Here</li><li>Nerd Challenge</li><li>Cook's Crush</li><li>Cook's Date</li><li>Comic Klepto</li><li>Jealous Johnny</li><li>Bait</li><li>Glass House</li><li>Tagging</li><li>Greaser Challenge</li><li>Wrong Part of Town</li><li>Lola's Race</li><li>The Tenements</li><li>The Rumble</li><li>Fighting Johnny Vincent</li></ul><p><b>Chapter 4: A Healthy Mind in a Healthy Body, and Other Lies</b></p><ul><li>Here's to you Ms. Philips</li><li>Stronghold Assault</li><li>Nerd Boss Fight</li><li>Jocks Challenge</li><li>Galloway Away</li><li>Paparazzi</li><li>Fun House</li><li>Defender of the Castle</li><li>Nice Outfit</li><li>Discretion Assured</li><li>The Big Game</li><li>Jock Boss Fight</li></ul><p><b>Chapter 5: The Fall and Rise of Jimmy Hopkins, Aged 15</b></p><ul><li>Cheating Time</li><li>Making a Mark</li><li>The Gym is Burning</li><li>Rats in the Library</li><li>Finding Johnny Vincent</li><li>Townies Challenge</li><li>Revenge on Mr. Burton</li><li>Preppies Vandalized</li><li>Smash it Up</li><li>Go See the Principle</li><li>Busting In Part I</li><li>Busting In Part II</li><li>Complete Mayhem</li><li>Final Showdown</li></ul><h2>Controversy</h2><p>Bully was banned in Brazil and appeals were made to ban it in the UK and USA. All PAL copies of Bully were renamed to Canis Canem Edit, Latin for <i>'Dog Eat Dog'</i>. Rockstar didn't ever release an official statement as to why the name was changed however it is suspected that it was due to the high amount of criticism the game received.</p><p>There was a minor homophobic outburst as a result of Jimmy's ability to kiss certain boys, in addition to all the girls his age in the game, with certain opponents claiming the game encouraged a homosexual lifestyle. Jack Thompson was specifically opposed to the game, calling it a "Columbine simulator" and accusing the game of being racist after seeing a screenshot of Jimmy sticking a black student's head in a toilet.</p><h2>Locations</h2><p>Bullworth Academy, a private school where all the creeps and trouble makers go who didn't cut it in public school, or have been dealt a very bad hand from their parents. If you aren't in a group at this school, even the nerd will think you're a loser. The school is broken up into four different groups. Greasers, their hang out is the garage in the school where they work on their bikes. Jocks, the tough athletes who hang out near the football field and are obsessed with their muscles and sports. Preps, the rich, stuck up snobs who see themselves as superior to everyone else. They have the best money can buy and they hang out in the boxing arena in Bullworth Vale. Finally, the Nerds, while they have the knowledge to build most of the projectile weapons in Bully for you, they are constantly picked on by the other groups. Their hangout is the library and observatory.</p><p>Bullworth Academy is a place that should only be chosen as a last resort. The school is filled with bullies, crazed teachers, and one very disgusting lunch lady. You've been warned, Bullworth Academy is not for the weak minded.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1379/929661-0000051861_350.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-929661" data-size="small" data-ratio="1" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1379/929661-0000051861_350.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-929661"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1379/929661-0000051861_350.jpg" alt="Bully Soundtrack"></a><figcaption>Bully Soundtrack</figcaption></figure><ol><li>Bully Main Theme (Running Theme)</li><li>Romance</li><li>Photography Class</li><li>Carnival Main</li><li>Halloween</li><li>The Set Up</li><li>The Big Game</li><li>Vendetta Greasers</li><li>Vendetta Preps</li><li>Johnny Vincent Boss Fight</li><li>Bully Fight Theme</li><li>Vendetta Dropouts</li><li>Final Showdown</li><li>The Search</li><li>Chase Prefects</li><li>Chase Adults</li><li>Wrong Part of Town</li><li>Bike Race 1</li><li>Go Kart Race 2</li><li>Glass House</li><li>Summer</li><li>Welcome to Bullworth (Bully Theme)</li></ol><h2>Bully: Scholarship Edition</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4340/776478-942199_93473_front.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-776478" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.415625" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:141.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4340/776478-942199_93473_front.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-776478"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Boxart for the Xbox 360 version of Bully: Scolarship." class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4340/776478-942199_93473_front.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4340/776478-942199_93473_front.jpg" alt="Boxart for the Xbox 360 version of Bully: Scolarship."></noscript></a><figcaption>Boxart for the Xbox 360 version of Bully: Scolarship.</figcaption></figure><p>In 2008, an enhanced port of of Bully was released for the Xbox 360, Wii, and PC, titled <a href="/bully-scholarship-edition/3030-5092/" data-ref-id="3030-5092">Bully: Scholarship Edition</a>.

This marks the first game without <a href="/andy-bogard/3005-56/" data-ref-id="3005-56">Andy Bogard</a> or <a href="/joe-higashi/3005-228/" data-ref-id="3005-228">Joe Higashi</a>. Set ten years after the death of <a href="/geese-howard/3005-280/" data-ref-id="3005-280">Geese Howard</a>, the only returning character is <a href="/terry-bogard/3005-34/" data-ref-id="3005-34">Terry Bogard</a>. The story primarily focuses on <a href="/rock-howard/3005-108/" data-ref-id="3005-108">Rock Howard</a>, the son of Geese and trained under Terry, and the new "King of Fighters" tournament (not to be confused with the <a href="/king-of-fighters/3025-407/" data-ref-id="3025-407">King of Fighters</a> series) hosted by the mysterious <a href="/kain-r-heinlein/3005-13579/" data-ref-id="3005-13579">Kain R. Heinlein</a>.</p><p> </p><p>The game is one of the most well-known games in the Fatal Fury series and is still played competitively worldwide for its balanced roster and highly-technical gameplay. The game was released for the Sega Dreamcast (under the title of Fatal Fury: Mark of the Wolves in the US), the <a href="/playstation-2/3045-19/" data-ref-id="3045-19">PlayStation 2</a> (Japan only), and the <a href="/xbox-360/3045-20/" data-ref-id="3045-20">Xbox 360</a> as an <a href="/xbox-live-marketplace/3045-86/" data-ref-id="3045-86">Xbox Live Arcade</a> game. The XBLA version was released for 800 msp on June 24, 2009, and features online play, <a href="/achievements/3015-29/" data-ref-id="3015-29">achievements</a>, and leaderboards.</p><p> </p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Garou - like many other SNK fighting games - uses four buttons - Light Punch, Strong Punch, Light Kick, Strong Kick. The game has throws as well as throw escapes. The game also has two evasion techniques, one which grants you upper body invincibility (this evasion is generally a standing attack), as well as one which grants you lower body invincibility (this evasion is generally an overhead attack). There are also rolling techniques, of which there are four. Rolls are performed by pressing one of the four attack buttons as you hit the ground from an attack, and each button allows your character to roll in a different direction with varying distance.</p><p> </p><ul><li>Light Punch: Small Roll, in front of the opponent</li><li>Light Kick: Small Roll, behind the opponent</li><li>Strong Punch: Large Roll, in front of the opponent</li><li>Strong Kick: Large Roll, behind the opponent</li></ul><h3>Guard Crush</h3><p>Each consecutive hit on a blocking opponent will gradually drain a non-displayed guard meter which regenerates when not blocking attacks. If a player manages to attack a blocking player for long enough, the blocking player will eventually flash red indicating that their guard meter is very close to being empty. Once the meter is fully drained, the blocking player will have his/her guard crushed, at which point the attacking player can successfully connect an attack or combo on them.</p><h3>Just Defense</h3><p>Just Defense is essentially the parrying technique in the game. If a player successfully blocks an incoming attack at the very last moment before it hits, they will have performed a Just Defense. By Just Defending moves, you recover faster from any block stun these moves may have had on you had you just been blocking normally. This decreased block stun generally allows you to counter attack the enemy as they are still recovering from their blocked move. For each successful Just Defense, the player will regain a small portion of health. If a player Just Defends a P Power or S Power super, they will gain a significantly larger portion of health back.</p><p> </p><h3>T.O.P. Mode</h3><p>During the character select screen 1/3 of the player's life bar can be designated as the T.O.P. portion. During this part of the player's health, the character recieves health regeneration (limited by the T.O.P. portion of the health bar), increased damage, and increased super bar generation. In addition, Light Kick and Strong Kick together during this time will give a T.O.P. move unique to each character that is only available in this mode. The player, by pressing up/down on the stick while selecting T.O.P. portion, can change the size of the portion, with the benefit of increased damage at the cost of potential T.O.P. length.</p><p> </p><h3>Feint Moves</h3><p>Feint moves can be performed using Light Punch and Light Kick plus forward or down. These actions create the beginning animation and voice over for a special attack, but do not complete the move. In addition, they can be used to link attack combinations. Terry Bogard in particular is a favorite for long feint combos.</p><p> </p><h3>Breaking</h3><p>Many of each character's special moves can be broken or canceled after the first attack. These are also very useful for increasing combination length.</p><p> </p><h2>Characters</h2><ul><li><a href="/rock-howard/3005-108/" data-ref-id="3005-108">Rock Howard</a></li><li><a href="/terry-bogard/3005-34/" data-ref-id="3005-34">Terry Bogard</a></li><li><a href="/bonne-jenet/3005-2300/" data-ref-id="3005-2300">Bonne Jenet</a></li><li><a href="/khushnood-butt/3005-3533/" data-ref-id="3005-3533">Khushnood Butt</a> (known in the Japanese version as Marco Rodriguez)</li><li><a href="/hokutomaru/3005-2362/" data-ref-id="3005-2362">Hokutomaru</a></li><li><a href="/hotaru-futaba/3005-2549/" data-ref-id="3005-2549">Hotaru Futaba</a></li><li><a href="/gato/3005-3508/" data-ref-id="3005-3508">Gato</a></li><li><a href="/kim-jae-hoon/3005-2560/" data-ref-id="3005-2560">Kim Jae Hoon</a></li><li><a href="/kim-dong-hwan/3005-2557/" data-ref-id="3005-2557">Kim Dong Hwan</a></li><li><a href="/kevin-rian/3005-2553/" data-ref-id="3005-2553">Kevin Rian</a></li><li><a href="/tizoc/3005-2290/" data-ref-id="3005-2290">Tizoc</a> (known in the Japanese version as The Griffon Mask)</li><li><a href="/freeman/3005-13578/" data-ref-id="3005-13578">Freeman</a></li><li><a href="/grant/3005-13580/" data-ref-id="3005-13580">Grant</a> (boss)</li><li><a href="/kain-r-heinlein/3005-13579/" data-ref-id="3005-13579">Kain R. Heinlein</a> (boss)</li></ul><p> </p><p> </p><h2>Similarities to Street Fighter III</h2><p>Many fans of Garou: Mark of the Wolves cited it as <a href="/snk-playmore/3010-616/" data-ref-id="3010-616">SNK</a>'s answer to <a href="/capcom/3010-367/" data-ref-id="3010-367">Capcom's</a> Street Fighter III games, Mark of the Wolves and Street Fighter III do have similarities between them such as the way both games only had few returning characters from previous games in each respective series as well as the parrying/just defense systems.</p><p>The parrying/just defense systems are probably the most notable similarity between the two. <a href="/street-fighter-iii-3rd-strike/3030-1615/" data-ref-id="3030-1615">Street Fighter III: Third Strike</a> utilized the parry system which allowed a player to parry all standing and aerial attacks by tapping forward at the very last second before getting hit, as well as parry low attacks by tapping down in the same fashion. While parrying generally put the player who performed it at a frame advantage, practically all characters had move(s) that recovered simply too quickly to allow a proper counter attack by the parrying player. Parrying in SF3:3S was generally very strict with timing, if you were a second too late or too early, you would fail your parry.</p><p> </p><p>In Garou: Mark of the Wolves, SNK implemented its Just Defense system. It is their interpretation of the parry, and it works differently in a few ways. The main difference is that a Just Defense is performed by blocking at the last second. You can Just Defend standing and aerial attacks by simply standing and blocking within the time constraints, and you could do the same about low attacks by blocking low. One of the notable differences with Just Defense is that the timing is more forgiving than it is with parrying, allowing players to either block too early and simply block the attack, or block at the right time and successfully Just Defend it. In addition Just Defending moves recovered a small portion of health when performed.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p>The Legend of Kage is a level-based Arcade action game that allows the player to jump up into the trees, swing a blade, and toss <a href="/shuriken/3055-51/" data-ref-id="3055-51">shuriken</a> at opposing fighters. It was developed by Taito originally for the Arcades, but was soon released on various home systems as well.</p><p>The goal of the game is to rescue the princess after she is abducted during the intro. Moving through the forest, the castle walls and eventually the castle itself, the hero Kage can find and rescue the princess. Upon leaving the castle, the princess is captured again and a boss fight ensues. After the boss, the four stages repeat, but with a different season.</p><p>As well as throwing shuriken and using his short blades, Kage can find various power-ups: There are orb-shaped power-ups that increase his health (which is indicated by the color of his tunic: Red means Kage can take a single hit and his initial status, green allows for two and yellow allows for three); a temporary boost to his shuriken throwing abilities that makes them spread out and a scroll which will instantly kill any ninja enemy that approaches while it is being read out, providing the player some easy kills.</p>]]></description>

      <deck><![CDATA[Ape Escape 2 is the PlayStation 2 sequel to 1999's critically acclaimed Ape Escape. It is an action platformer developed by SCEI that places the player in the shoes of Jimmy, who has to stop an army of monkeys once again led by Specter from taking over the world.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p>Ape Escape 2 was developed by <a href="/sony-computer-entertainment-incorporated/3010-995/" data-ref-id="3010-995">SCEI</a> (now <a href="/sce-japan-studio/3010-2472/" data-ref-id="3010-2472">SCE Japan Studio</a>) exclusively for the <a href="/playstation-2/3045-19/" data-ref-id="3045-19">PlayStation 2</a> and was published by Sony in both Japan and Europe. <a href="/ubisoft-entertainment/3010-82/" data-ref-id="3010-82">Ubisoft</a> published the title in North America after <a href="/sony-computer-entertainment-america/3010-313/" data-ref-id="3010-313">SCEA</a> confirmed that they had chosen not to publish the title in favor of focusing on their homegrown platformers <a href="/jak-daxter/3025-366/" data-ref-id="3025-366">Jak and Daxter</a> and <a href="/ratchet-clank/3030-18309/" data-ref-id="3030-18309">Ratchet &amp; Clank</a>.</p><p>The game closely follows the pattern set forth by <a href="/ape-escape/3030-13371/" data-ref-id="3030-13371">Ape Escape</a>, using the same controls and premise of capturing monkeys as the original. The game is comprised of twenty levels across seven worlds. Features include a new protagonist, new monkeys, new gadgets, and new mini games.</p><p>The goal of the game is to capture three hundred monkeys that are out wreaking havoc on the world, with the ultimate goal being to stop their leader, the super-intelligent evil white monkey known as <a href="/specter/3005-3868/" data-ref-id="3005-3868">Specter</a>, from using them to take over the world.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p>It's been a few years since the events of Ape Escape and everything has returned to normal. There are no more manic mischievous monkeys maladroitly meandering across the mainland, and humans have kept their status as the world's dominate species. All is well.</p><p>The Professor decides to take a vacation and leave Jimmy, <a href="/spike/3005-2135/" data-ref-id="3005-2135">Spike</a>'s cousin, in charge of his lab while he's away. Jimmy is given the simple assignment of sending a shipment of specially designed monkey pants to Monkey Park via the lab's transporter. Distracted by a TV show, Jimmy overloads the transporter and inadvertently sends every citizen in Monkey Park a new Peak Point Helmet along with their new pair of pants.</p><p>Specter, seizing the opportunity, once again commands the recently helmeted monkeys to aid him in his attempt at taking over the world. It's now up to Jimmy to capture the monkeys, stop Specter, and save the world before The Professor returns.</p><h2>Controls</h2><p>Ape Escape 2's controls are almost exactly like those found in the first game. All character movement is controlled using the left analog stick, while the right stick is used to attack with the selected gadget in whatever direction the player pushes it. This gives the player the ability to attack anywhere around the character.</p><p>With some gadgets (such as the Stun Club and the Dash Hoop) the player must instead spin the right analog stick in rapid circles, resulting in a 360 degree attack or a charging up of the gadget.</p><p>The face buttons are used to switch between gadgets, and the shoulder buttons are used for jumping and camera control<i>.</i></p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The gameplay of Ape Escape 2 is essentially the same as that found in original. Because of this, some of the content found in the gadgets section is borrowed from the original <a href="/ape-escape/3030-13371/" data-ref-id="3030-13371">Ape Escape</a> page.</p><h3>Gadgets</h3><p>Gadgets are the most important part of gameplay, allowing Jimmy to capture and attack monkeys, while also helping him to navigate the environment. Jimmy will have access to a total of twelve gadgets - nine returning gadgets from the original Ape Escape and three new ones (denoted by an *).</p><ul><li><b>Electro Magnet*</b> - A gadget that is used to manipulate certain magnetic objects found throughout the game. Use the right analog stick to select the object, and the left stick to move it.</li><li><b>Bananarang*</b> - A throwing gadget used to lure hungry monkeys with the scent of bananas towards wherever it lands. Swing the right analog stick to throw the bananarang.</li><li><b>Water Cannon*</b> - Sprays water to put out fires obstructing progress through the level. Can also be used to stun monkeys. Sprays in whatever direction the right stick is pressed.</li><li><b>Stun Club -</b> A lightsaber-like gadget that stuns monkeys, and also harms various other enemies. Swing the right analog stick to swing the club.</li><li><b>Monkey Net -</b> The only gadget that can capture monkeys (on land). Swing the right analog stick to swing the net.</li><li><b>Aqua Net -</b> The only gadget that can be used underwater. It is automatically switched to when Jimmy is in water, and can shoot out nets to capture monkeys.</li><li><b>Monkey Radar -</b> A radar that is used to find monkeys. The closer Jimmy is to a monkey, the faster and higher-pitched the sound it emits will be. Once close enough, the camera can zoom in on the monkey and display a little bio. Rotating the right analog stick rotates the radar dish.</li><li><b>Catapult -</b> A slingshot that stuns monkeys. Can also harm enemies and hit buttons. Can shoot 3 different types of pellets: Normal, Guided, or Explosive. Pull back on the right analog stick to aim, and let go to shoot.</li><li><b>Sky Flyer -</b> A little handheld propeller that allows Jimmy to rise up in the air. Spin the right analog stick to spin the Sky Flyer, and give Jimmy lift. Continuous spinning will not keep Jimmy airborne, but it will slow his descent.</li><li><b>R.C. Car -</b> A remote controlled car that can fit through small holes. Used to hit unreachable buttons, or to draw monkeys out of hiding. The right analog stick controls the car.</li><li><b>Power Punch -</b> Obtainable after defeating Specter for the first time. An extendable device with what appears to be a boxing glove at the end, it is a powerful Gadget that can destroy boxes and walls that the Stun Club cannot. Tilt the right analog stick slightly for a weak punch, all the way for a strong one.</li><li><b>Dash Hoop</b> - A hula hoop that gives Jimmy a speed boost, also allowing him to bowl over enemies. Spin the right analog stick to spin and charge the hoop. Once charged, let go of the stick to activate the boost.</li></ul><h3>Monkeys</h3><p>All of the three hundred monkeys found in Ape Escape 2 are unique. They all have their own names, stats (alertness, aggression, speed, and stomach fullness), personality traits (e.g. cheeky, easygoing, flashy), and fighting styles.</p><p>Capturing all three hundred of them is not required though, as each level has a quota that must be met in order to proceed that is usually less than the total number of monkeys found in that level.</p><p>There are light stealth elements to the gameplay. It is easier to catch monkeys that have not detected Jimmy's presence. Each monkey's situational awareness level is represented by the color of the light on top of their helmet. Blue means the monkey is in a state of calm and is unaware anything is a miss. Yellow signifies that it is in caution mode, it suspects something is up and will become more aware of its surroundings. Red means that the monkey knows Jimmy is there, and will try to flee or fight back.</p><h3>The Freaky Monkey Five</h3><p>In addition to the three hundred regular monkeys, there's a group of five boss monkeys known as the Freaky Monkey Five. They were given Vita-Z bananas by Specter, turning them into stronger, tougher, more intelligent foes.</p><ul><li><b>Blue Monkey</b> - The first of the Freaky Monkey Five Jimmy comes across. He is mostly unremarkable compared to his other four counterparts, his only outstanding qualities being his enhanced speed and intelligence. He zips around on a unicycle, forcing Jimmy to use the Dash Hoop to keep up with him.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Yellow Monkey</b> - Yellow Monkey has a thing for the Vita-Z bananas, and after eating way more than he was supposed to grows to the size of a small sky scraper. Though he is very large, he is also very nimble, and the only way for Jimmy to defeat him is to wait for a rush attack then hit him with the Stun Club.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Pink Monkey</b> - She fancies herself a pop singer. When Jimmy first meets her she believes him to be an adoring fan and starts singing to him. However when Jimmy tries to capture her she freaks out and becomes Dark Pink Monkey, giving her many attacks such as laser beams, force fields, and flames.</li></ul><ul><li><b>White Monkey</b> - The most intelligent of the Freaky Monkey Five, White Monkey fights Jimmy with brains rather than brawn. He fights Jimmy be creating and controlling a robot version of him called Mecha Jimmy he built using data he obtained about the real Jimmy. Luckily, Mecha Jimmy has a major weak point that White Monkey failed to foresee.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Red Monkey</b> - The final member of the Freaky Monkey Five Jimmy faces, Red Monkey is also the strongest monkey in the game. He kidnaps Jimmy's tiny monkey companion who is eventually taken to Specter's moonbase. He uses a wide range of physical attacks, from martial arts and boxing, to stunning Jimmy with flatulence.</li></ul><h2>Levels</h2><p>Ape Escape 2 contains twenty levels spread out across seven worlds.</p><p><b>World 1</b></p><ul><li>Liberty Island</li><li>Breezy Village</li><li>Port Calm</li><li>Viva Apespania</li></ul><p><b>World 2</b></p><ul><li>Castle Frightmare!</li><li>Vita-Z Factory</li><li>Casino City</li><li>Ninja Hideout</li></ul><p><b>World 3</b></p><ul><li>Snowball Mountain</li><li>Lookout Valley</li><li>The Blue Baboon</li></ul><p><b>World 4</b></p><ul><li>Enter the Monkey</li><li>Simian Citadel</li></ul><p><b>World 5</b></p><ul><li>Pirate Isle</li><li>Land of the Apes</li><li>The Lost World</li></ul><p><b>World 6</b></p><ul><li>Skyscraper City</li><li>Code C.H.I.M.P.</li></ul><p><b>World 7</b></p><ul><li>Moon Base (yes, they go to the moon)</li></ul>]]></description>

      <deck><![CDATA[An early vertical shooter developed by TOSE and published by Jaleco in Japan. It was Jaleco's first release for the Famicom.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p>Exerion is a vertical-scrolling shooter, where the player's ship would shoot upwards to take out waves of enemies. Though most of the screen was a static black, on the bottom half of the screen the player could see the horizon of whichever planet they were on rushing towards them, including various geographical fixtures whizzing past in a manner similar to <a data-ref-id="3015-2915" href="/parallax-scrolling/3015-2915/">parallax scrolling</a>.</p><p>The game is an example of an early shoot-em-up: There are no power-ups, just waves of enemies. Players had a limited number of lives and had to start over once they ran out. Enemies, rather than departing the screen upon passing the player's ship, would home in towards them in order to collide with and destroy them: The player had to circle back around and maneuver underneath the enemies in order to shoot them down.</p><p>Exerion had four versions: The original 1983 arcade version, its initial MSX home version of the following year, a Sega SG-1000 version and an eventual Famicom version in 1985. The Famicom version would also be rereleased on the Wii Shop's Virtual Console decades later. The arcade version, though the best looking, was also the hardest to play as the ship had a strong sense of inertia and momentum to it, making it sluggish to move and difficult to control. The home versions were better regarded.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Crimsonland is a simple <a href="/top-down-perspective/3015-788/" data-ref-id="3015-788"> top-down</a> shooter in which, depending on the mode, the player attempts to survive as long as possible or through multiple waves of enemies</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Crimsonland starts the player in the middle of the screen, and creatures begin swarming the player soon after the level starts. The player must avoid being completely overrun and killed by running around the screen and shooting the enemies, which may drop <a href="/power-up/3015-700/" data-ref-id="3015-700"> power-ups</a> and weapons that increase the player's power.</p><p data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The player aims with the mouse, pointing a reticle in the direction he wants to shoot. Movement is handled with WASD or arrow keys. The control scheme is similar to some PC adaptations of dual-joystick shooters. If the level chosen is a campaign level, the player must survive until the waves of enemies stop. If it is challenge mode, then the player must survive as long as possible. The further a player has reached in the campaign, the more powerful weapons will be available in challenge mode.</p><p data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">There is an extra mode that forgoes the normal gameplay to instead use typing to kill enemies in a manner reminiscent of <a href="/the-typing-of-the-dead/3030-616/" data-ref-id="3030-616"> The Typing of the Dead</a>. The player is stuck in the middle of the screen, unable to move. The incoming creatures have a label with a single word chosen from a random assortment words that must be typed in to kill that assailant. As the player progresses, longer and harder words are given and enemies attack faster and faster. If an enemy reaches the player and they are not shot off before they deplete the player's HP, the player loses.</p><h2>Game Modes</h2><h3>Quests</h3><p data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Quest mode consists of 50 levels, split into five chapters, each level getting progressively harder. The player begins each level with only a pistol, but as more and more levels are completed more weapons and power-ups become available. There is also "Hardcore" mode that is unlocked after beating all of the levels in normal; this is similar to normal, except more enemies appear.</p><h3>Rush</h3><p data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Players encounter a large amount of enemies, and only have a assault rifle to fend them off with. There are no <a href="/perks/3015-366/" data-ref-id="3015-366"> perks</a> or power-ups in this mode, the goal is to survive as long as possible.</p><h3>Survival</h3><p data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Players are placed in a never-ending level that; as this mode progresses, enemies appear more frequently get progressively harder.</p><h3>Type-o-shooter</h3><p data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">A game mode where players have to type out the monster's word instead of physically attacking them.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p>Final Fantasy VII was developed by Squaresoft (now known as <a href="../../square-enix/65-104/" rel="nofollow">Square Enix</a>) and published in the US by Sony Computer Entertainment on the Sony PlayStation on September 7, 1997 (and later for PC and iOS). The game is credited for revolutionizing the role-playing genre, and many of today's Role Playing Games use the story- and <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/cutscene/3015-22/" data-ref-id="3015-22">cutscene</a>-heavy model as a blueprint. The game originally shipped on three CDs. The extra space was required for the game's pre-rendered video content. Though role-playing games had an American audience throughout the 8- and 16-bit eras, many credit Final Fantasy VII for the genre's current level of popularity, as the game's pre-rendered <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/full-motion-video/3015-604/" data-ref-id="3015-604">Full Motion Video</a> (FMV) cutscenes and wide epic scope were unlike anything that had come before it.</p><p>It has retrospectively been acknowledged as the game that popularized <a title="Role-playing game" href="/rpg-elements/3015-3603/" data-ref-id="3015-3603">role-playing games</a> outside of Japan, and as the <a title="PlayStation" href="/playstation/3045-22/" data-ref-id="3045-22">PlayStation</a>'s killer app that cemented its lead over other fifth-generation consoles.</p><p>Its critical and commercial success paved the way for the rise of cinematic storytelling in the video game industry. Final Fantasy VII also played an instrumental role in the PlayStation's sales victory over the <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-64/3045-43/" data-ref-id="3045-43">Nintendo 64</a>; it was originally intended for the N64, but due to its cartridge limitations, Final Fantasy VII instead moved to the PlayStation.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p>Final Fantasy VII revolves around a company named <a href="../../shinra-electric-power-company/92-53/" rel="nofollow">Shinra</a> that is drawing from the very life of the planet to create energy called <a href="../../mako/92-1241/" rel="nofollow">Mako</a> to power its technology. This process is causing widespread ecological problems. The main character, <a href="../../cloud-strife/94-321/" rel="nofollow">Cloud Strife</a>, is a mercenary. He is hired by a rebel group, <a href="../../avalanche/92-1506/" rel="nofollow">AVALANCHE</a> , to destroy Shinra's <a href="../../mako-reactor/93-990/" rel="nofollow">Mako reactors</a> in an attempt to slow down the planet's decay. Fellow Avalanche members <a href="../../tifa-lockhart/94-803/" rel="nofollow">Tifa Lockhart</a> and <a href="../../barret-wallace/94-795/" rel="nofollow">Barret Wallace</a> join Cloud even after his quest takes his focus away from Shinra. Along the way, Cloud and his group discover that Mako comes from the life energy of the planet, called the <a href="../../lifestream/92-1509/" rel="nofollow">Lifestream</a>. When the planet is injured, the energy from the Lifestream focuses on that injury to heal the planet. To make things even more troubling, <a href="../../sephiroth/94-511/" rel="nofollow">Sephiroth</a>, Cloud's former partner and the most powerful <a href="../../soldier/92-1237/" rel="nofollow">SOLDIER</a> on the planet, plans to cause a planet-wide catastrophe by summoning <a href="../../meteor/93-1142/" rel="nofollow">Meteor</a> to crash into the earth so he can draw all the Mako energy released to himself and gain god-like power.</p><h2>Combat</h2><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3689/207912-ffvii_8__before.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-207912" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3689/207912-ffvii_8__before.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-207912"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3689/207912-ffvii_8__before.jpg" alt="PHS: changing the party lineup."></a><figcaption>PHS: changing the party lineup.</figcaption></figure><p>Final Fantasy VII introduced an updated version of the combat system from previous Final Fantasy titles. It used 3-dimensional graphics to bring new life to the turn-based combat system of 8 and 16-bit Role Playing Games. Utilizing the <a href="../../active-time-battle/92-95/" rel="nofollow">Active Time Battle</a> system (ATB) introduced in Final Fantasy IV, players must make their decisions quickly in battle, as enemies will attack whether or not the player acts. The player may choose two characters to accompany the main character, Cloud, in battle.</p><p>Final Fantasy VII introduced the <a href="/materia/3055-27/" data-ref-id="3055-27">Materia</a> system. Players collect magical orbs of pure Mako energy that contain magic. They would level up along with the characters, getting stronger, introducing better and more advanced moves and eventually even spawning another orb of the same name. Players attach Materia to the available slots on the two types of equipment (Weapons/Accessory) any of the characters have on at the time. Depending on the types of slots (single/combined) players could create some powerful combinations of magic characters can use to devastate the battlefield.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3689/207910-ffvii_7__before.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-207910" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3689/207910-ffvii_7__before.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-207910"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3689/207910-ffvii_7__before.jpg" alt="A combat sequence in action."></a><figcaption>A combat sequence in action.</figcaption></figure><p>For example, a combined Materia slot could have the magic "Bolt" in one side and "All" on the other, creating a magic attack that would strike all the enemies on the screen at once with electricity. Some of the more powerful Materia in the game required many hours of searching or side-questing. These were usually worth seeking because they allowed players to perform some of the more powerful moves in the game. Special weapons like Apocalypse, Scimitar and accessories also had the ability to gain double, or even triple AP, allowing the player to level Materia more quickly. Many of the more powerful types of Materia would summon creatures to attack enemies.</p><h3>Materia</h3><p>In general, purple Materia enhance the character's Status; blue Materia are effective when used paired with other Materia in linked slots. and yellow Materia increase the number of commands that can be used.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Interdependent (purple)</th><th>Support (blue)</th><th>Command (yellow)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cover</td><td>All</td><td>Steal</td></tr><tr><td>Chocobo Love</td><td>Elemental</td><td>Sense</td></tr><tr><td>Long Range</td><td>Added Effect</td><td>Enemy Skill</td></tr><tr><td>Counter</td><td>HP Absorb</td><td>Throw</td></tr><tr><td>Enemy Lure</td><td>MP Absorb</td><td>Manipulate</td></tr><tr><td>Speed Plus</td><td>Added Cut</td><td>Deathblow</td></tr><tr><td>MP Plus</td><td>MP Turbo</td><td>Morph</td></tr><tr><td>HP Plus</td><td>Steal as Well</td><td>Double Cut</td></tr><tr><td>Luck Plus</td><td>Magic Counter</td><td>Master Command</td></tr><tr><td>Magic Plus</td><td>Final Attack</td><td>Slash-All</td></tr><tr><td>Gil Plus</td><td>Quadra Magic</td><td>Mime</td></tr><tr><td>Pre-Emptive</td><td>Sneak Attack</td><td>X-Magic</td></tr><tr><td>Exp.

He was revered as the best that SOLDIER had to offer and was hailed as a hero for his service to Shinra. Sephiroth fell from grace when he discovered his true origins and the circumstances surrounding the way he was actually 'made'. While he was in the womb of <a href="/lucrecia-crescent/3005-3070/" data-ref-id="3005-3070">Lucrecia</a> (his mother) he was injected with <a href="/jenova/3005-4832/" data-ref-id="3005-4832">Jenova</a> cells - Jenova being an alien life form that is often mistaken as a member of the <a href="/cetra/3015-1740/" data-ref-id="3015-1740">Cetra</a>, or the first humans to have lived on the planet. When Sephiroth found out he was a creation of Shinra, he lost his mind. He assumed himself to be an Ancient as Jenova was his actual mother. With this in mind he plotted a scheme to become god and exact his revenge on mankind. He planned to do this by calling <a href="/meteor/3055-1142/" data-ref-id="3055-1142">Meteor</a> (the black Materia) to destroy the planet. When Meteor hits the planet the Lifestream will expel an incredible amount of energy to heal the shattered planet. Sephiroth's goal is to become one with the life energy, thus becoming a god.

Two thousand years before the games main events Jenova crash landed on the planet on a meteor. On the planet the Cetra, i.e. the ancients, were inhabiting at the time, Jenova used its abilities to trick the Cetra, killing them off one by one. In a desperate struggle, the remaining Cetra used all their power and locked away the life form in the Northern Crater (which was created when Jenova landed there in the first place). In the present day Jenova was rediscovered by Professor Gast and mistook as a Cetra. He used the Jenova life form in a project called 'The Jenova Project' where Jenova Cells were infused inside Lucrecia's womb. This is when Sephiroth was born. Jenova was stored at the Shinra Headquarters at the start of the game, and from there Sephiroth dragged it away and kept the head with him.</p><ul><li><a href="../../rufus-shinra/94-2651/" rel="nofollow">Rufus Shinra</a> ( <a href="../../shinra-electric-power-company/92-53/" rel="nofollow">Shinra Co.</a>)</li></ul><p>Rufus Shinra was 25 years old at the start of Final Fantasy VII.

The game was originally planned as a 2D game on the SNES, that was not the only major change to how the game eventually turned out. The Creator of Final Fantasy, <a href="../../hironobu-sakaguchi/72-633/" rel="nofollow">Hironobu Sakaguchi</a> originally intended for the game to take place in present day New York City. Development on the game was stalled, due to priority going over to the <a href="../../chrono-trigger/61-9249/" rel="nofollow">Chrono Trigger</a> project that was being developed at the same time.</p><p>Development recommenced later on in 1995. The original script saw a major overview, with a detective story theme being cast aside and co-director, <a href="../../yoshinori-kitase/72-634/" rel="nofollow">Yoshinori Kitase</a>, pushed for the game to go 3D for concerns that the series would be left behind back in the 2D era. Also, it was decided to make the game for Nintendo’s next console, the N64. Though due to FFVII’s ambitious design, Square expressed concerns to Nintendo over their decision to use cartridges instead of a new format capable of storing much more information, called CD-ROM’s, on their new console. This dispute continued and led to Square announcing on the 12 of January 1996, that it would be dropping relations with Nintendo and developing FFVII on Sony’s debut console, the Playstation. A reported $45,000,000 was spent over the extent of the games development.</p><p>Development required the efforts of approximately 120 artists and programmers, using PowerAnimator and Softimage 3D software.

On June 3rd 2009, Final Fantasy 7 was released for the European and American PSN stores for €9.99 and $9.99 respectively. This announcement was made days before during Sony's press conference of E3 2009. June 4th Marked the release of FF7 on the UK PSN store for the price of £7.99.</p><h2>PC Releases and Requirements</h2><p>Final Fantasy VII was published for Windows 95 by Eidos not long after the original Playstation release, in June of 1998, coming on multiple CDs like its console counterpart did. This version was largely intact in comparison to the console release, with a few differences:</p><ul><li>Polygonal graphics were smoother, employing texture filtering and taking advantage of the PC's higher resolution, if you had a 3D accelerator</li><li>Pre-rendered graphics appeared grainier due to the low resolution of the renders juxtaposed with higher native resolution of computer monitors</li><li>Soundtrack was output in MIDI format; quality of orchestration was thus dependent on the PC's sound card (a hack was later made available to import the Playstation sound file library such that the music was rendered to sound exactly how it did on consoles)</li><li>Localization was cleaned up, removing the poor grammar, missing words, and misspellings of the original console release</li><li>Game's aesthetics were moddable, thanks to homebrew hacks, such that different character models, combat areas and sound themes could be applied providing for a more modern look and feel</li></ul><p>Square Enix then re-released this PC version in August of 2012, exclusively from its online store as a digital download. The differences between console version and initial PC release apply with this re-release as well; in other words, backgrounds are still low-res and music is still MIDI. With this re-release, the following further changes apply:</p><ul><li>36 achievements are integrated into the game</li><li>Character booster gives players the option to increase their character stats and money without restriction should they desire to just play through the plot (i.e. cheat through the game)</li><li>Support for cloud saves</li><li>The game is no longer moddable natively and must undergo a total conversion process to the "old" version of the game in order to be modded (doing this removes the achievements, character booster, and cloud saves)</li></ul><p><b>Original Windows requirements (1998)</b></p><ul><li>Windows 95 with DirectX 5.1 installed;</li><li>Pentium 166 (without 3D accelerator card), Pentium 133 (with 3D accelerator card);</li><li>260MB Hard drive space (standard install), 460MB (maximum install);</li><li>32MB RAM;</li><li>100% DirectX 5.1 compatible SVGA video card;</li><li>100% Windows 95 compatible 4x CD-ROM drive;</li><li>100% DirectX 5.1 compatible sound card configured to playback digital and MIDI audio.</li></ul><p><b>Re-release Windows Requirements (2012)</b></p><ul><li>Microsoft Windows XP/Vista/7 (32/64-bit)</li><li>At least 2GHz CPU</li><li>At least 1GB RAM</li><li>DirectX 9-compatible GPU</li></ul><h2>iOS Release</h2><p>An iOS port of Final Fantasy VII was released on August 20, 2015. It requires an iPhone 5S, iPad 3, or iPad Mini 2 running at least iOS 8.0 with 4GB of free space. Aside from control optimisation for touch devices, the iOS release also includes a maximum stats setting and the ability to disable all non-scripted combat encounters. Using these two features together allows players to experience the story without level grinding and frequent encounters.</p><h2>Remake</h2><p>Final Fantasy VII is a popular game in the series, and due to this rumours of a remake to the next generation consoles was imminent. In 2005 at the Sony E3 Press Conference, <a href="/square-enix/3010-104/" data-ref-id="3010-104">Square-Enix</a> showed of a tech demo showing the opening intro sequence of the game on the PS3. Due to this a lot of buzz was being created around the subject, and individuals were getting excited at the notion of a remake.</p><p>Soon after Square-Enix made an official statement clearly stating that there are no plans for a remake to hit the stores any time soon. There has been even more speculation from the game <a href="/crisis-core-final-fantasy-vii/3030-2361/" data-ref-id="3030-2361">Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII</a> that was released late 2007, which depicted the characters <a href="/zack-fair/3005-776/" data-ref-id="3005-776">Zack</a> and <a href="/cloud-strife/3005-321/" data-ref-id="3005-321">Cloud</a> in CG scenes towards the end of the game. To add to this, during the end credits it stated 'To be continued in FINAL FANTASY VII'.</p><p>The remake was confirmed at the 2015 Square-Enix E3 press conference. It's going to be released on Xbox One and PS4.</p><h2>Related Media</h2><p>Due to the popularity of the original Final Fantasy VII game released in 1997, Square Enix have released other forms of media based of the world the original game was set in, using the same characters and places as reference points. First of which is the movie Advent Children released in 2006, which was a CGI film based years after the events of the original game. Next was the game <a href="/dirge-of-cerberus-final-fantasy-vii/3030-5571/" data-ref-id="3030-5571">Dirge of Cerberus</a> released in 2006 on the <a href="/playstation-2/3045-19/" data-ref-id="3045-19">Playstation 2</a>, which describes the story of optional character <a href="/vincent-valentine/3005-788/" data-ref-id="3005-788">Vincent Valentine</a>. It takes place before Advent Children and describes his relationship with Lucrecia Crescent (Sephiroth's mother) in detail. Next was the game Crisis Core released in 2007 for the Playstation Portable. It takes place before the original Final Fantasy VII, with the main protagonist being Zack Fair. Zack had a intimate reltaionship with Aerith Gainsborough and was best friends with Cloud. It shows the story of his struggle and also how Cloud ended up in Midgar for the start of Final Fantasy VII. Relating to the game Crisis Core, there also was a OVA (original video animation) of the stories of Zack and Cloud, and how they managed to end up in Midgar. It is a 25 minute video which basically shows the ending the Crisis Core in anime form. The ending for Crisis Core was different from the Last Order OVA which was released first.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3318/255770-grimfandangoss.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-255770" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3318/255770-grimfandangoss.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-255770"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3318/255770-grimfandangoss.jpg" alt="255770-grimfandangoss.jpg"></a></figure><p>Grim Fandango is a critically-acclaimed adventure game directed by <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/tim-schafer/3040-2860/" data-ref-id="3040-2860">Tim Schafer</a> and released by <a href="/lucasarts/3010-644/" data-ref-id="3010-644">LucasArts</a> in 1998. Players take the role of protagonist <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/manny-calavera/3005-689/" data-ref-id="3005-689">Manny Calavera</a>, a travel agent for the Department of Death and <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/soul-reaper/3015-746/" data-ref-id="3015-746">grim reaper</a>, as he travels through the <a href="/land-of-the-dead/3035-219/" data-ref-id="3035-219">Land of the Dead</a> on a quest to reach the Ninth Underworld and his eternal rest. The game's story and setting primarily draw from aspects of Hispanic culture, Aztec mythology, and <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/film-noir/3015-1732/" data-ref-id="3015-1732">film noir</a> cinema. Many of Grim's characters including Manny are voiced by Hispanic actors, and the game's script is peppered with Spanish words and phrases. Grim Fandango was the first LucasArts adventure game to feature 3D <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/polygonal-3d/3015-1430/" data-ref-id="3015-1430">polygonal</a> characters moving and interacting in a <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/pre-rendered-backgrounds/3015-1804/" data-ref-id="3015-1804">pre-rendered</a> 2D world.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Grim Fandango moves away from the <a href="/point-and-click/3015-75/" data-ref-id="3015-75">point-and-click</a> interface of the <a href="/scumm/3015-429/" data-ref-id="3015-429">SCUMM</a> engine used in preceding LucasArts adventure games; it instead makes use of the <a href="/grime/3015-1084/" data-ref-id="3015-1084">GrimE</a> engine, which allows players to directly manipulate the movements of 3D characters using keyboard <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/tank-controls/3015-4647/" data-ref-id="3015-4647">tank controls</a>. As Manny walks through the environment, his head will turn to look towards certain important objects or characters; players may examine, pick up or use the object Manny is looking at with the appropriate keyboard commands. Grim Fandango's minimal presentation was praised for its cinematic qualities, but it was also criticized for being unwieldy compared to a more traditional point-and-click adventure game interface.</p><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/569/218317-bonewagon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-218317" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/569/218317-bonewagon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-218317"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/569/218317-bonewagon.jpg" alt="218317-bonewagon.jpg"></a></figure><p>Although the control scheme and game engine were new to the genre, Grim's core gameplay remains much the same as previous LucasArts adventure games and primarily alternates between navigating humorous <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/dialogue-trees/3015-77/" data-ref-id="3015-77">dialogue trees</a> and completing <a href="/inventory/3015-513/" data-ref-id="3015-513">inventory</a>-based puzzles in order to advance the plot. Players must explore their environment thoroughly to find key objects and may converse with <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/non-player-character/3015-967/" data-ref-id="3015-967">NPC characters</a> or examine their surroundings for hints about the solution; these puzzles also demand varying levels of abstract reasoning. Grim Fandango is infamous for its difficulty even among other adventure games of the era, and some of the game's most challenging puzzles require players to not only observe, but also to listen carefully to character dialogue or even ambient noise in the environment in order to progress.</p><h2>Setting</h2><p>Grim Fandango's setting combines elements of Aztec mythology and <a href="/mexico/3035-249/" data-ref-id="3035-249">Mexican</a> folklore with a heavy dose of noir-style influence drawn from films such as <em>Casablanca</em> and <em>The Big Sleep</em>. The game takes place primarily in the Eighth Underworld of the Land of the Dead, a limbo that must be traversed by the souls of the deceased in order to reach their final reward in the Ninth Underworld and truly rest. Souls in the Land of the Dead take the form of skeletal Mexican calaca figures used during the Day of the Dead festival; naturally, this same festival is also celebrated within the Land of the Dead, during which time many souls visit loved ones in the Land of the Living. Several varieties of demons also inhabit this world, some of which co-exist with human souls and may be summoned for specific tasks such as maintenance or security. In areas of urban development, the bleak and lifeless landscape of the Eighth Underworld gives way to a 1930s-era film noir ambiance. Art deco and Aztec motifs are interwoven in many building facades and interiors, and the game's cast often dresses and behaves in typical noir fashion. Several characters also smoke heavily in keeping with the genre, which Grim's manual humorously references by addressing anti-smoking concerns with the fact that the game's characters are already dead.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3318/317597-mural_restored.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-317597" data-ratio="0.32096584216726" data-width="960" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 960px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:32.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3318/317597-mural_restored.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-317597"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="A mural depicting the four-year journey of the soul through the Eighth Underworld" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/3318/317597-mural_restored.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/3318/317597-mural_restored.jpg" alt="A mural depicting the four-year journey of the soul through the Eighth Underworld"></noscript></a><figcaption>A mural depicting the four-year journey of the soul through the Eighth Underworld</figcaption></figure><p>All souls begin their journey in <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/el-marrow/3035-333/" data-ref-id="3035-333">El Marrow</a>, the largest city in the Eighth Underworld, for processing at the Department of Death. The souls of the dead are brought to the Eighth Underworld by "travel agents" working for the DOD who act as grim reapers, fetching recently-departed souls from the Land of the Living and setting them on their journey through the Land of the Dead. Souls who led poor lives must attempt a four-year journey on foot with little or no assistance, and they are often waylaid by terrible danger or lack of resources along a seemingly-endless path. Souls who led good lives may be offered a better choice of travel options, with the fastest mode of transport being the "Double-N" Number Nine Express: a luxury passenger train available only to the most virtuous souls that ferries them safely across the entirety of the Eighth Underworld in a mere four minutes.</p><p>Leaving the city of El Marrow by other means leads to the Petrified Forest, a maze of stone trees which are mined for a concrete-like substance used to construct El Marrow's skyscrapers. Souls fortunate enough to survive the forest's demonic denizens must cross a wide desert to reach the port town of <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/rubacava/3035-361/" data-ref-id="3035-361">Rubacava</a>, where they may secure passage on a ship bound for Puerto Zapato on the opposite side of the Sea of Lament. The final stretch leads across vast icy wastes and snow-covered mountains, where an ancient <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/ninth-underworld-temple/3035-568/" data-ref-id="3035-568">temple</a> serves as the portal to the Ninth Underworld.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3318/255851-grimfandangoss_28.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-255851" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3318/255851-grimfandangoss_28.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-255851"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="The Edge of the World, one of Grim Fandango's many surreal environments" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3318/255851-grimfandangoss_28.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3318/255851-grimfandangoss_28.jpg" alt="The Edge of the World, one of Grim Fandango's many surreal environments"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Edge of the World, one of Grim Fandango's many surreal environments</figcaption></figure><p>Not all souls who make the long journey through the Eighth Underworld are guaranteed to reach their final destination, and many suffer a kind of "true death" along this treacherous path, such as dismemberment by any of the soul-hungry demons and monsters that roam the less-developed regions. Souls who led particularly despicable lives or who have made the journey through dishonest means may also be denied passage to the Ninth Underworld entirely, instead being cast into a fiery pit for all eternity. One of the most feared methods of true death is being "sprouted" by special Sproutella dart guns that create flowers which cover a soul's skeletal figure, causing immobilizing pain and eventually consuming the soul in the process. These weapons are popular among the strong elements of organized crime that have risen to claim power over other, weaker souls seeking salvation in the Land of the Dead.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1495/186238-gf_screen7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-186238" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1495/186238-gf_screen7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-186238"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Manuel "Manny" Calavera in his professional attire" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1495/186238-gf_screen7.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1495/186238-gf_screen7.jpg" alt="Manuel "></noscript></a><figcaption>Manuel "Manny" Calavera in his professional attire</figcaption></figure><p><a href="/manny-calavera/3005-689/" data-ref-id="3005-689">Manny Calavera</a> is a departed soul that has become disillusioned with his stagnant position in the bureaucracy of the afterlife. As a travel agent for the Department of Death, it is Manny's solemn duty to <a href="/soul-reaper/3015-746/" data-ref-id="3015-746">reap</a> the souls of the recently-departed from the Land of the Living and usher them into the city of <a href="/el-marrow/3035-333/" data-ref-id="3035-333">El Marrow</a> in the <a href="/land-of-the-dead/3035-219/" data-ref-id="3035-219">Land of the Dead</a>, where they are judged for their deeds in life before being sent on their long journey to reach the Ninth Underworld. Manny himself is obligated to serve as an agent of the DOD until he has worked off an unspecified debt to the "powers that be" by selling enough Number Nine tickets to virtuous souls for their journey across the Land of the Dead. Once a top-rated salesman of travel packages, Manny has recently fallen into a slump due to a severe lack of clients who qualify for these premium "Double-N" tickets. After reaping the soul of yet another lackluster client, Manny realizes that his boss <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/don-copal/3005-1090/" data-ref-id="3005-1090">Don Copal</a> assigns all the best clients to arrogant rival reaper <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/domino-hurley/3005-1835/" data-ref-id="3005-1835">Domino Hurley</a>, thus making Manny's prospects of repaying his debt and reaching the Ninth Underworld extremely unlikely. Tired of waiting for a turnaround in his fortunes, Manny devises a scheme to steal one of Domino's clients and reclaim his former prestige as the DOD's premier reaper.</p><p>Although Manny successfully obtains an outstanding client, he is still unable to secure a Number Nine ticket for the saintly <a href="/mercedes-colomar/3005-779/" data-ref-id="3005-779">Mercedes Colomar</a>. After reluctantly consigning Mercedes to a four-year journey on foot in spite of her spotless record, Manny begins to suspect that corruption has taken root inside the DOD. However, he is immediately accused by Copal of stealing Domino's client (among other recent infractions) and is quickly detained in the DOD's garage. An unexpected ally named <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/salvador-limones/3005-1104/" data-ref-id="3005-1104">Salvador Limones</a> soon arrives at Manny's makeshift cell to release him, and he is eventually recruited as the newest (and only) field agent of the <a href="/lost-souls-alliance/3015-2679/" data-ref-id="3015-2679">Lost Souls Alliance</a>: a tiny resistance group dedicated to fighting corruption in the Eighth Underworld and restoring dignity to the souls cheated out of their rightful passage through the Land of the Dead. With the assistance of the LSA, Manny escapes El Marrow through a secret underground tunnel and embarks on a quest to find his lost "Meche". Emerging on the outskirts of the <a href="/petrified-forest/3035-359/" data-ref-id="3035-359">Petrified Forest</a>, Manny soon encounters his demonic chauffeur <a href="/glottis/3005-847/" data-ref-id="3005-847">Glottis</a>, who had recently been fired from the DOD for modifying company vehicles without permission. By working together, the pair manage to pass through the dangerous forest as well as the expansive desert beyond it, eventually reaching the sleepy port town of <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/rubacava/3035-361/" data-ref-id="3035-361">Rubacava</a>.</p><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129563/2773196-rubacava.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2773196" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129563/2773196-rubacava.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2773196"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Rubacava's cat-racing track at Feline Meadows" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/129563/2773196-rubacava.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/129563/2773196-rubacava.jpg" alt="Rubacava's cat-racing track at Feline Meadows"></noscript></a><figcaption>Rubacava's cat-racing track at Feline Meadows</figcaption></figure><p>Grim Fandango's story takes place over four years; each chapter occurs during the Day of the Dead festival with a year-long break between acts, allowing for a significant amount of off-screen character development. Manny typically ends each chapter as he begins a new entry-level job position required to continue his search for Mercedes. Their first-year anniversary after leaving El Marrow finds Manny and Glottis as successful co-owners of the new Calavera Café, a thriving nightclub and casino in Rubacava. When Mercedes finally arrives at his club one night, Manny abandons everything he had built in the past year to pursue her. However, Mercedes is quickly dragged away onto the departing SS Lambada by Domino, who has risen to a position of power in the DOD since Don Copal's brutal murder a year ago by co-conspirator and crime boss <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/hector-lemans/3005-1097/" data-ref-id="3005-1097">Hector LeMans</a>. After being prevented from boarding Domino's ship by Mercedes herself, Manny concocts a plan that same night to book passage for both Glottis and himself as crewmen aboard <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/velasco/3005-5876/" data-ref-id="3005-5876">Velasco's</a> cargo ship, the SS Limbo.</p><p>Another year passes, and Manny's passion for success has allowed him to rise to the rank of captain aboard the newly-rechristened and re-chromed SS <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/lola/3005-5894/" data-ref-id="3005-5894">Lola</a>. After making port at Puerto Zapato on the Day of the Dead, Manny receives word from Salvador's carrier pigeons that corrupt DOD agents have been dispatched with orders to assassinate Manny and his entire crew. He also learns that after being abducted by Domino, Mercedes threw herself overboard somewhere near "The Pearl," a legendary treasure resting at the bottom of the Sea of Lament that shines brightly enough to lure many greedy souls to a watery doom. Making a narrow escape in the severed stern section of his ship, Manny and Glottis arrive near the Pearl's location just before the remainder of the SS Lola sinks to the bottom of the ocean. With the assistance of a longtime seafloor wanderer named <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/chepito/3005-31266/" data-ref-id="3005-31266">Chepito</a>, the pair carve a path through the murky depths and eventually arrive at a coral-mining facility at the <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/edge-of-the-world/3035-567/" data-ref-id="3035-567">Edge of the World</a>, where Mercedes and several other lost souls are being held by Domino against their will. Manny sabotages the mining plant, raising the wreck of Velasco's long-lost ship SS Lamancha from the seafloor and rescuing Mercedes in the process; however, his new ship is quickly pursued by Domino, and a showdown ensues between the two reapers which ultimately results in Domino's grisly demise.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129563/2773197-temple.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2773197" data-ratio="0.6875" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:68.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129563/2773197-temple.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2773197"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Ninth Underworld Temple" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/129563/2773197-temple.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/129563/2773197-temple.jpg" alt="Ninth Underworld Temple"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ninth Underworld Temple</figcaption></figure><p>At long last, after reaching Puerto Zapato again and trekking across vast frozen tundra, Manny's group finally reaches the <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/ninth-underworld-temple/3035-568/" data-ref-id="3035-568">Ninth Underworld Temple</a> another year later, where Glottis suddenly falls critically ill due to his recent lack of exposure to motorized vehicles. While Manny and Mercedes investigate Glottis' condition, the rest of their group is detained by the Ninth Underworld's gatekeeper; he states that these souls were issued Double-N tickets upon arrival in the Land of the Dead which must be redeemed to pass through. The punishment for selling Double-N tickets is severe, and unless Manny can produce his group's assigned tickets, their souls will be damned for eternity.</p><p>Utilizing a makeshift rocket-propelled gondola, Manny, Mercedes and a revitalized Glottis ride the Number Nine's rails all the way back to Rubacava. The trio recovers the Bonewagon that had been stored there so that they may slip into "Nuevo Marrow": the renamed city of El Marrow that has since become a den of vice and corruption under Hector's control. Accompanied by the ultra-hip <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/olivia-ofrenda/3005-1758/" data-ref-id="3005-1758">Olivia Ofrenda</a>, a self-professed admirer of Salvador and his noble cause, the group arrives at LSA headquarters underneath Nuevo Marrow shortly thereafter. Olivia, Salvador and Meche split off to conduct vital reconnaissance of Hector LeMans' casino inside the former DOD building while Manny and Glottis investigate the sewers beneath the city and discover the floral boutique of Bowsley, Hector's paranoid supplier of Sproutella weaponry. Arming himself with deadly baby's breath, a disguised Manny infiltrates Hector's casino and eventually reaches Hector LeMans himself. After gaining Hector's trust, Hector leads Manny back to his old office and unwittingly offers him his former position at the DOD just before Manny reveals himself and demands the stolen tickets at gunpoint. Hector narrowly escapes by falling from the roof of the casino after losing his precious stash of Double-N tickets.</p><p>Manny meets Mercedes at Nuevo Marrow's train station to entrust her with the stolen tickets, but the pair are ambushed by Hector's men and forced to split up. Manny escapes into Olivia's waiting car with the tickets; however, he is betrayed by Olivia, who reveals herself to be Hector's lover after tossing Salvador's battered and disembodied skull into Manny's lap. Olivia drives Manny to the outskirts of town to dispose of him at Hector's greenhouse, where he is shot with slow-acting Sproutella by a gloating Hector. Manny manages to escape from the greenhouse in great pain before collapsing in Hector's hillside garden, using the last of his strength to freeze the floral growth in his rib cage with liquid nitrogen before it can spread. He returns to Olivia's car and is given his final orders by Salvador's head: secure the Sproutella gun in the car's trunk and look after the rest of the LSA. Olivia quickly discovers Manny loitering near her car and picks up Salvador's skull, who bites down on his hidden Sproutella-filled fake tooth, sprouting both himself and Olivia.</p><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129563/2810134-gfending.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2810134" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129563/2810134-gfending.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2810134"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2810134-gfending.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/129563/2810134-gfending.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/129563/2810134-gfending.jpg" alt="2810134-gfending.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>Recovering the key to the trunk from Salvador's decapitated body, Manny returns to the greenhouse for a final showdown with Hector; however, Hector is very well-armed and the situation soon becomes a stalemate. After a lengthy shoot-out, Manny eventually devises a way to neutralize his arch-nemesis and, in a gruesome floral explosion, puts a decisive end to the criminal career of Hector LeMans. Manny returns to the temple with Mercedes, Glottis and the stolen tickets, where he explains Hector's scheme to the gatekeeper and secures his friends' release. He also bids a tearful farewell to Glottis; as a spirit of the land, Glottis cannot pass into the Ninth Underworld. After saying their goodbyes, Manny, Meche and the other lost souls finally board the Number Nine on an express trip to their rightful hereafters.</p><h2>Legacy</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1371/190604-grimfandango106.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-190604" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1371/190604-grimfandango106.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-190604"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="The Grim Fandango cast" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1371/190604-grimfandango106.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1371/190604-grimfandango106.jpg" alt="The Grim Fandango cast"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Grim Fandango cast</figcaption></figure><p>While critically acclaimed, Grim Fandango was not a commercial success; however, it did spawn a large fan base attracted by its humor and bizarre aesthetic.

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p>City Connection has one or two players (taking turns) driving through a total of five different cities. The five levels resemble New York (USA), Paris (France), Neuschwanstein (Germany), Egyptian temples and a lakeside area.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>As each stage is traversed, the road behind the car turns white as it is painted, to show where the player has driven. Several obstacles attempt to stop the player's car such as police cars, cats and spike strips. Once all blocks in a level have been painted, the player moves on to the next stage. Random red balloons will appear, if the player grabs three in the same level, it will warp them ahead a few levels and provide bonus points. Even if the player ends up back in New York, the difficulty will stay the same as the previous level warped from.</p><h2>Music</h2><p>Each level has its own musical track, although they all resemble "Allegro non troppo e molto maestoso" from Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No.1.</p><h2>Roots</h2><p>City Connection's general gameplay is similar to <a href="/miner-2049er/3030-14533/" data-ref-id="3030-14533">Miner 2049er</a> which was released on several platforms including the <a href="/apple-ii/3045-12/" data-ref-id="3045-12">Apple II</a>, <a href="/atari-2600/3045-40/" data-ref-id="3045-40">Atari 2600</a> and <a href="/atari-5200/3045-67/" data-ref-id="3045-67">5200</a>, <a href="/commodore-64/3045-14/" data-ref-id="3045-14">Commodore 64</a> and <a href="/colecovision/3045-47/" data-ref-id="3045-47">ColecoVision</a>. In that game the player must fully investigate mines.</p>]]></description>

      <deck><![CDATA[Life Force is the US title for the Japanese video game Salamander. Though similar to Gradius, Life Force does have some unique modifications to differentiate it from its more well-known predecessor.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p>Known by its original Japanese name Salamander, the game first hit Arcades in 1986. Though Salamander did not take place entirely within an alien organism, this idea was expanded upon for its US release and given a more biological name to suit the change - Life Force.</p><p>This new organic version was re-released in Japanese Arcades with the changed name, as well as adopting Gradius' old power-up system and some additional sprite work.</p><p>Salamander's first home port would be the MSX version in 1987, which received a new story and an entirely new animated introduction sequence. The game would later see a NES version, also with reworked stages (including a skeletal vertical-scrolling stage and an Egyptian-themed stage) and the old Gradius power-up system as well as versions for many other popular home computers and consoles of the period.</p><p>In 2008 (Japan)/2009 (US) the NES version would be re-released for the Wii's Virtual Console.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Salamander is a spiritual sequel to <a href="/gradius/3030-15508/" data-ref-id="3030-15508">Gradius</a>, <a href="/konami-corporation/3010-87/" data-ref-id="3010-87">Konami</a>'s earlier shooter, and shares many deliberate similarities with its predecessor. The player flies the customizable spaceship <a href="/vic-viper/3055-71/" data-ref-id="3055-71">Vic Viper</a> through a series of horizontally scrolling levels, destroying enemies and collecting power-ups to assist them. Unlike Gradius, which had the player stack up tokens to unlock power-ups of their choosing, the ones found in Salamander are random. However the old Gradius system would reappear in many versions of Salamander, including the NES home version.</p><p>There exists the possibility of a second player. Instead of the blue Vic Viper, the second player pilots the red Lord British, based on the Vic Viper design.</p><p>It was noted at the time for its simulated speech samples and graphical quality, especially with some of the stage animations. Particularly memorable is one stage set in the midst of a raging inferno that would occasionally send arcs of flame flying across the screen.</p><h3>Power-Ups</h3><p>Attentive players can find one of three types of power-up item while playing: These include the red power-ups, found after destroying an enemy wave or a gold-tinted enemy, which the player can spend towards power-ups provided they have the right amount. The player can also run across blue power-ups, which work as instantaneous smart bombs that clear the screen of enemies, and the rare flashing power-ups that grant an extra ship.</p><ul><li><strong>Speed Up:</strong> The cheapest power-up, Speed Up makes the ship faster, allowing for more maneuverability.</li><li><strong>Missile:</strong> This power-up allows the player's ship (and any Options they might have) to launch two missiles from the top/bottom of the ship (or left/right in vertical stages) which coast along walls until they either hit something or leave the screen. The player can select the missile power-up again to increase their speed.</li><li><strong>Ripple:</strong> A weapon that fires rings of energy at enemies. The rings expand the further they get away from the ship, making them useful for hitting multiple targets accurately.</li><li><strong>Laser:</strong> A concentrated laser beam of considerable power. Selecting Laser again makes it wider and slower. The beam will actually travel with the ship's movements, allowing the player to sweep the screen with it. Can't be used simultaneously with the Ripple beam: Activating one deactivates the other.</li><li><strong>Option:</strong> An Option is an additional weapon platform that follows the main ship. It is able to fire all the weapons the main ship can, essentially doubling the player's firepower. In the US version, up to two Options can be obtained, though this number increases to three for the Japanese version. A side-effect is that enemy units become stronger to compensate for this added power.</li></ul>]]></description>

      <deck><![CDATA[Scramble is a side-scrolling shooter. The player controls a spaceship across a scrolling terrain, battling obstacles along the way. Scramble is credited with setting the template for most of the side-scrolling shooters that followed its release.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p>Scramble is a <a href="/side-scrolling/3015-299/" data-ref-id="3015-299">side-scrolling</a> shooter originally developed by <a href="/konami-inc/3010-679/" data-ref-id="3010-679">Konami</a> for the arcade. The game predates <a href="/gradius/3030-15508/" data-ref-id="3030-15508">Gradius</a>, and shares many qualities with that classic franchise.</p><p>Scramble is a <a title="Side-scrolling video game" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-scrolling_video_game" rel="nofollow">side-scrolling</a> shooter with forced scrolling. It was the first scrolling shooter to offer multiple, distinct <a title="Level (video gaming)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_(video_gaming)" rel="nofollow">levels</a>. The game is thus credited with setting the template for most of the side-scrolling shooters that followed its release.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/537343-scramble_3.png" data-ref-id="1300-537343" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="1.1425" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:114.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/537343-scramble_3.png" data-ref-id="1300-537343"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8273/537343-scramble_3.png" alt="Scramble's second stage"></a><figcaption>Scramble's second stage</figcaption></figure><p>Scramble is a horizontal shooter played using a four-way joystick and two buttons that control the forward guns and bombs. The game has six stages, and in each stage the player must navigate a gauntlet of enemies. The environment is also a considerable hazard as the terrain can be difficult to navigate with the slow ship. Additionally, the ship is constantly running out of fuel, and must refuel on the fly by destroying fuel tanks that litter the stages. The final stage requires the player to finish a tricky bombing run, which if they fail, they must repeat the stage. After finishing the last level, the game loops back to the first stage and plays again at a higher difficulty level where the ship runs out of fuel more quickly.</p><h2>Legacy</h2><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/26740/1084985-scramble_arcade_flyer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1084985" data-size="small" style="width: 227px" data-ratio="1.3215859030837" data-width="227" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:132.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/26740/1084985-scramble_arcade_flyer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1084985"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/26740/1084985-scramble_arcade_flyer.jpg" alt="Arcade flyer"></a><figcaption>Arcade flyer</figcaption></figure><p>Scramble was ported to many different home game systems and computers, both legally and as illegal clones. It was the subject of an important intellectual property case (Stern Electronics, Inc. v. Kaufman, 669 F.2d 852) where it was ruled that <a href="/stern-electronics-inc/3010-2694/" data-ref-id="3010-2694">Stern Electronics Inc</a>. (the game's publisher in North America) could copyright the images and sounds in a game and not just the game's source code.</p><h3>Sequels and Relation To Gradius</h3><p>The arcade game <a href="/super-cobra/3030-10519/" data-ref-id="3030-10519">Super Cobra </a>could be called a sequel to Scramble, as it shares basically the same game mechanic as the original. Scramble is also cited as a predecessor to Gradius in both the introduction to <a href="/gradius-galaxies/3030-2030/" data-ref-id="3030-2030">Gradius Galaxies</a> on the <a href="/game-boy-advance/3045-4/" data-ref-id="3045-4">Game Boy Advance </a>and the Gradius Breakdown bonus DVD included with <a href="/gradius-v/3030-10201/" data-ref-id="3030-10201">Gradius V</a>; however, Konami disputed the relation in their guide for the Gradius Portable collection on <a href="/psp/3045-18/" data-ref-id="3045-18">PSP</a>. Although Scramble may now not be part of the official Gradius continuum, it's easy to see how some of the features of Scramble, such as independently-fired weapons and hazardous terrain, were further developed for Gradius.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p>Crazy Climber is a 1980 <a href="/nihon-bussan-co-ltd/3010-249/" data-ref-id="3010-249">Nihon Bussan</a> <a href="/arcade/3045-84/" data-ref-id="3045-84">arcade</a> game in which the player must scale a tall building while avoiding dangers during their ascent. It is in some part inspired by the "Human Fly" craze of the late 70s.</p><p>The game was eventually released on the <a href="/nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-21/" data-ref-id="3045-21">Famicom</a> in 1986 and came bundled with a special controller that allowed the player to control both arms of the climber. It was also available on other home systems, such as the <a href="/atari-2600/3045-40/" data-ref-id="3045-40">Atari 2600</a>.</p><p>It is one of Nichibutsu's most highly acclaimed video games in its library. A precursor to the platformer genre, Crazy Climber was the first game revolving around climbing, specifically climbing buildings, before <a title="Nintendo" href="/nintendo/3010-90/" data-ref-id="3010-90">Nintendo</a>'s seminal 1981 release <a title="Donkey Kong" href="/donkey-kong/3030-311/" data-ref-id="3030-311">Donkey Kong</a>.</p><h2>Lives</h2><p>The player is awarded 3 lives at the beginning of each games. An extra life is given after the players reaches 30,000 points.</p><h2>Score</h2><p>For every story of the building climber, the player scores</p><ul><li>1st Building - 100 points</li><li>2nd Building - 150 points</li><li>3rd Building - 200 points</li><li>4th Building - 250 points</li></ul><h3>Bonus Points</h3><p>Bonus points are awarded when after successfully climbing each building and the climber is carried off by the helicopter. However, the bonus score decreases every ten seconds that the climber spends ascending the building.</p><ul><li>1st Building - 10,000 points</li><li>2nd Building - 20,000 points</li><li>3rd Building - 30,000 points</li><li>4th Building - 40,000 points</li></ul><h2>Trivia</h2><ul><li>An Arcadia 2100 port was in the works, but never got released.</li><li>Musical themes in the game include <i>Baby Elephant Walk</i>, <i>The Pink Panther</i> and <i>The Entertainer</i>.</li></ul><h2>Legacy</h2><ul><li>In 1981, <a title="Bandai" href="/bandai-co-ltd/3010-272/" data-ref-id="3010-272">Bandai</a> Electronics manufactured a hand-held <a title="Vacuum fluorescent display" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_fluorescent_display" rel="nofollow">VFD</a> version of the game.</li><li>The game has also been ported to the <a title="Atari 2600" href="/atari-2600/3045-40/" data-ref-id="3045-40">Atari 2600</a> and the Japanese <a title="Nintendo Entertainment System" href="/nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-21/" data-ref-id="3045-21">Famicom</a>.</li><li>A Japanese-only sequel, <a title="Crazy Climber 2" href="/crazy-climber-2/3030-35476/" data-ref-id="3030-35476">Crazy Climber 2</a>, was produced in 1988. The game was essentially identical to Crazy Climber in gameplay but featured more sophisticated graphics and a few new features.</li><li>On February 3, 1996, Hyper Crazy Climber was released only in Japan for the <a title="PlayStation" href="/playstation/3045-22/" data-ref-id="3045-22">PlayStation</a>. It has similar gameplay to that of the original game but also a few differences. Players can choose between three cartoony characters, each with their own strength/speed attributes. Several buildings can be selected from a <a title="Bomberman (series)" href="/bomberman/3025-67/" data-ref-id="3025-67">Bomberman</a>-style map screen, including an underwater building, a medieval clock tower, a haunted skyscraper, and a beanstalk. Power-ups are also used.</li><li>On March 2, 2000, Crazy Climber 2000 was released for the <a title="PlayStation" href="/playstation/3045-22/" data-ref-id="3045-22">PlayStation</a>. This is more of a remake of the original arcade game using 3D graphics for the first time. A notable feature is the ability to turn corners and access different sides of the buildings, which now have a variety of designs (including one with a cylindrical, tower-like shape). The game included the original port of the arcade Crazy Climber and a scan of the instruction panel.

      <deck><![CDATA[A side scrolling arcade shoot 'em up and the first in Konami's famous series. The game became famous for its extreme difficulty and varied power-ups.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p>Gradius is a <a href="/side-scrolling/3015-299/" data-ref-id="3015-299">side scrolling</a> shooter, a <a href="/spiritual-successor/3015-425/" data-ref-id="3015-425">spiritual successor</a> to <a href="/scramble/3030-14662/" data-ref-id="3030-14662">Scramble</a>, and the first in the <a href="/gradius/3025-261/" data-ref-id="3025-261">Gradius </a>franchise. Players control a ship called the <a href="/vic-viper/3055-71/" data-ref-id="3055-71">Vic Viper</a> through multiple space stages. The enemies encountered include a large array of alien ships and creatures which try to collide into the Vic Viper or shoot it down. Luckily, throughout each stage <a href="/power-up/3015-700/" data-ref-id="3015-700">power-ups</a> are collected by shooting down certain color enemies. Power-ups are saved up on a power meter on the bottom of the player's screen. Once a player reaches the power-up cell that they wish to buy, it can be obtained by pressing the select button (<a href="/nes/3045-21/" data-ref-id="3045-21">NES</a> release). The power-up cells include:</p><ul><li><b>Speed Up</b>: Increases the movement speed of the Vic Viper.</li><li><a href="/missile/3055-74/" data-ref-id="3055-74"> <b>Missile</b></a>: Drops missiles to kill ground targets with every shot.</li><li><b>Double</b>: Shoots two cannon shots at once rather than one shot.</li><li><b>Laser</b>: Replaces the standard cannon shot with a laser beam.</li><li><b>Option</b>: Creates a hovering orange ball that follows the Vic Viper doubling its firepower with each Option.</li><li><b>?</b>: Provides a <a href="/shield/3055-87/" data-ref-id="3055-87"> shield</a> on the front of the ship.</li></ul><p>At the end of each stage a boss battle takes place where, more often than not, the Vic Viper must shoot at its core to destroy it. Many of these bosses have shields that protect their core that the player must destroy before being able to lay waste to the core itself.</p><h2>Trivia</h2><ul><li>The NES version was the first game to ever include the <a href="/konami-code/3015-544/" data-ref-id="3015-544"> Konami code</a>.</li></ul>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview </h2>The King of Fighters 2000 is a 2D 3-on-3 fighting game developed and published by <a data-ref-id="3010-616" href="/snk-playmore/3010-616/">                    SNK</a> for the <a data-ref-id="3045-25" href="/neo-geo/3045-25/">                   Neo Geo</a>. It is the seventh installment of the <a data-ref-id="3025-407" href="/king-of-fighters/3025-407/">                  King of Fighters</a> series and is the final King of Fighters game by the original SNK before the company became financially bankrupt. The story continues from <a data-ref-id="3030-5964" href="/the-king-of-fighters-99/3030-5964/">                 The King of Fighters '99</a>, as commander <a data-ref-id="3005-3422" href="/heidern/3005-3422/">                Heidern</a> uses the King of Fighters tournament (with the aid of his friend, Ling, who has his own secret agenda) to lure protagonists <a data-ref-id="3005-220" href="/k/3005-220/">               K'</a> and <a data-ref-id="3005-2230" href="/maxima/3005-2230/">              Maxima</a> out so they could be interrogated into telling the whereabouts of the evil NESTS syndicate. <br /> <br />The Hero team from the previous installment was split into two teams: the Hero team and the Benimaru team, each including new characters, such as the mercenary <a data-ref-id="3005-3497" href="/vanessa/3005-3497/">             Vanessa</a>, the Mexican wrestler <a data-ref-id="3005-3496" href="/ramon/3005-3496/">            Ramon</a>, the agent <a data-ref-id="3005-4379" href="/seth/3005-4379/">           Seth</a>, and the assassin <a data-ref-id="3005-4380" href="/lin/3005-4380/">          Lin</a>. <a data-ref-id="3005-139" href="/blue-mary/3005-139/">         Blue Mary</a> and <a data-ref-id="3005-4363" href="/king/3005-4363/">        King</a> from the Women Fighters team are swapped with <a data-ref-id="3005-182" href="/mai-shiranui/3005-182/">       Mai Shiranui</a> and <a data-ref-id="3005-3492" href="/yuri-sakazaki/3005-3492/">      Yuri Sakazaki</a> of the Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting team. <a data-ref-id="3005-4381" href="/li-xiangfei/3005-4381/">     Li Xiangfei</a> from the Women Fighters team was replaced by the new <a data-ref-id="3005-4375" href="/hinako-shijou/3005-4375/">    Hinako Shijo</a>. <a data-ref-id="3005-197" href="/kyo-kusanagi/3005-197/">   Kyo Kusanagi</a> and <a data-ref-id="3005-1014" href="/iori-yagami/3005-1014/">  Iori Yagami</a> are playable with no team association, with Kyo's clones absent. A new character and sub-boss, <a data-ref-id="3005-3495" href="/kula-diamond/3005-3495/"> Kula Diamond</a> (the "Anti-K'"), debuts in this installment. <br /> <br />The game also features unique alternate Strikers based on characters from either earlier installments of the King of Fighters series, from other SNK franchises, or completely new conceptual versions of characters. (Such as alternate costumes for K' and Iori)<br /><br /><h2>Characters </h2><h3> <b>Hero Team</b><br /></h3><ul class="plain-list"><li> <a href="../../kyo-kusanagi/94-197/" rel="nofollow"> </a><a

      <deck><![CDATA[Galaga is a vertical shooter arcade game released in 1981. Developed by Namco and published by Namco and Midway.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p>Released in 1981, Galaga has become one of the most popular arcade games of all time. Much more well received than its predecessor, <a href="/galaxian/3030-2445/" data-ref-id="3030-2445">Galaxian</a>, Galaga features fast paced <a href="/top-down-perspective/3015-788/" data-ref-id="3015-788">top-down</a> shooting action. The player takes control of a small ship located at the bottom of the screen and is tasked with destroying the incoming waves of insect-like enemies.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/13/139866/2697342-1031-155633.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2697342" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="1.2857142857143" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:128.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/13/139866/2697342-1031-155633.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2697342"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/139866/2697342-1031-155633.jpg" alt="Tractor-beam"></a><figcaption>Tractor-beam</figcaption></figure><p>The player controls a "fighter" spaceship whose movement is restricted to flying left or right. Upon the start of a level, waves of enemies fly in formation and complete a flight pattern before positioning themselves at the top of the screen. It is ideal to destroy the incoming ships before they complete their fly-in. Once in formation at the top of the screen, enemies will regularly break off to attack. Enemy ships attack by dropping bombs and/or attempting to collide with the player's ship.</p><p>The most popular and effective strategy is for the player to sacrifice their own ship to a "Boss Galaga" ship. These ships hover above the player and emit a tractor-beam. Entering this beam will sacrifice the current ship and allow the player to use one of the reserves. Destroying the "Boss Galaga" will reclaim the captured ship. The player is then rewarded with dual ships which effectively doubles the player's firepower.</p><p>Additionally, a bonus stage occurs every four levels, allowing the player to earn extra points without the risk of being destroyed. Upon destroying every fighter during a bonus stage, the player will then be rewarded with an extra life.</p><h2>Galaga in Mass Media</h2><ul><li>1982 - Actor <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000111/" rel="nofollow">Matthew Broderick</a> spent two months playing Galaga to prepare for his upcoming role in Wargames.</li><li>2004 - The ABC television series Lost names a <a href="http://lostpedia.wikia.com/wiki/Galaga" rel="nofollow">DHARMA Initiative submarine</a> after the popular video game.</li><li>2009 - Fans are able to purchase a Galaga arcade-style video game Christmas ornament (complete with audibles) thanks to Hallmark.</li><li>2012 - In Marvel's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Avengers_%282012_film%29" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">The Avengers</a>, <a href="/iron-man/3005-1370/" data-ref-id="3005-1370">Tony Stark</a> catches a <a href="/shield/3015-2363/" data-ref-id="3015-2363">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a> agent playing Galaga. The agent denies it but after the main characters leave the room he goes back to playing the game.

Malfunctioning security systems and hostile organic weapons (called Neogens) will impede their progress, while traumatized Genoq employees may be able to help the courier piece together what happened at the building prior to the player's arrival.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>Mere hours after receiving an urgent call in his <a href="/paris/3035-487/" data-ref-id="3035-487">Paris</a> apartment, the protagonist of D/Generation, a nameless courier, arrives in <a href="/singapore/3035-1881/" data-ref-id="3035-1881">Singapore</a> via <a href="/jet-pack/3055-6/" data-ref-id="3055-6">jet pack</a>, touching down on the 80th floor of Genoq Biolabs' medical research facility with an important package for lead Genoq scientist Jean-Paul Derrida. As soon as he enters, however, the doors shut and seal themselves behind him. This, however, proves to be the least of his problems, as the receptionist soon informs him of Genoq's dire state. All lines of communication to the outside world have been severed, and furthermore the building's security systems and dangerous Neogens have run amok. Despite the perils within and the receptionist's adamant warnings, the courier chooses to proceed, perhaps believing that the item in his possession holds the key to stopping the chaos which grips Genoq.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2023943-d_gen_intro.png" data-ref-id="1300-2023943" data-size="small" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2023943-d_gen_intro.png" data-ref-id="1300-2023943"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2023943-d_gen_intro.png" alt="Something is amiss within Genoq Biolabs."></a><figcaption>Something is amiss within Genoq Biolabs.</figcaption></figure><p>Over the course of his journey into the building's upper reaches, the courier learns that Genoq had been steeped in the realm of illegal bioweapon development for some time, and that their medical research, which had long ago become unprofitable for them, was little more than a front for their more lucrative practice of creating and selling biological weapons called Neogens. Derrida had been brought on by the company to spearhead a project which would create the ultimate Neogen, and the fruit of his efforts, an artificial organism dubbed D/Generation, was ultimately the source of the disturbances within the building. Further complicating matters, he also learns that Genoq's corporate leaders have authorized an airstrike against the building in order to prevent details of their activities from going public.</p><p>Upon reaching the top floor, the courier discovers that it was not Derrida, but rather D/Generation that sent for him, and that the package he carried with him held a neurotransmitter which it needed in order to escape the building. Trapped within a hallucinatory realm conjured by his own creation, Derrida warns the courier that D/Generation must not be allowed to leave, as it was designed to be a genetically perfect killer that could blend in anywhere. Utilizing Derrida's advice, the courier is successful in luring D/Generation into a trap where it is killed by powerful microwaves. With moments to spare, he escapes the building, preventing the airstrike and saving the remaining employees trapped within the Genoq building.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The main gameplay of D/Generation consists of traversing interconnected rooms (called "scenes" within the game), accomplishing various tasks within them in order to ascend to the next level of the tower. Each level is comprised of multiple scenes, and each scene typically presents a particular challenge which must be overcome in order to progress. The game alternates between action-based and puzzle-based gameplay, with many scenes requiring some combination of both. On the action side of things, players are constantly harassed by hostile Neogens and security systems, which frequently require quick reflexes in order to defeat. Certain doors will only unlock when an area has been cleared of dangerous entities, and furthermore it is usually not feasible to rescue survivors (who grant additional lives) until an area has been completely cleared of enemies.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2057112-getting_weird.png" data-ref-id="1300-2057112" data-size="small" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2057112-getting_weird.png" data-ref-id="1300-2057112"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="As the game reaches its climax, the tone becomes unexpectedly surreal." class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2057112-getting_weird.png"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2057112-getting_weird.png" alt="As the game reaches its climax, the tone becomes unexpectedly surreal."></noscript></a><figcaption>As the game reaches its climax, the tone becomes unexpectedly surreal.</figcaption></figure><p>At the same time, there are cases where it is more advantageous to manipulate an enemy rather than killing it outright, which leads into the game's more cerebral leanings. Trackers can be used to kill other Trackers without firing a shot, for instance, and a Neogen that collides with a plasma barrier will permanently disable it. These are just two examples of instances in which the player is rewarded for thinking before they shoot. Most areas contain switches which can open and close doors, activate and deactivate security measures, or both, and success in many scenes comes down to manipulating these switches (as well as other devices, such as computer terminals and teleporters) in such a way as to provide safe passage for ones' self and any civilians. Timing and pattern recognition is also a crucial element throughout the game, since tougher puzzles can require that a series of deliberate actions be performed quickly.</p><p>The player's Laser sidearm is a good example of how D/Generation marries action and puzzle design elements. Its first and most obvious purpose is to kill the various hostile inhabitants of the Genoq building, however it's beams can activate switches, and will also ricochet, so it is usefully in many situations in which the player might wish to activate a switch from a distance, or cannot feasibly approach one due to a particular hazard. Even in combat situations when one is faced with forces that represent an immediate danger, it often behooves the player to be mindful of other objectives within the environment, as a stray volley could, for instance, kill a survivor, thus depriving the player of an additional life as well as potential exposition.</p><h2>Weapons &amp; Items</h2><p>The arsenal of D/Generation, while not exceedingly deep, is decidedly tactical. Other than the Laser, which has unlimited uses, all items within the game are collected individually, with most being quite rare. With such limited quantities, this means that even using a single Grenade might have serious repercussions later on, like the inability to fight back against a deadly C/Generation. In general, it is a good idea to only use an item when presented the a situation which would be otherwise extremely difficult, if not impossible, to overcome.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2023947-laser.png" data-ref-id="1300-2023947" data-size="small" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.61538461538462" data-width="26" style="width: 26px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:61.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2023947-laser.png" data-ref-id="1300-2023947"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Laser" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2023947-laser.png"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2023947-laser.png" alt="Laser"></noscript></a><figcaption>Laser</figcaption></figure></td><td><h3>Laser</h3> The first weapon found by the courier and the only one which has unlimited uses, the Laser is an invaluable tool not only for killing lesser Neogens like A/Generations and B/Generations, but also for solving various puzzles throughout the game that might require long-range switch activation.</td></tr><tr><td><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2023945-grenade.png" data-ref-id="1300-2023945" data-size="small" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="1" data-width="18" style="width: 18px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2023945-grenade.png" data-ref-id="1300-2023945"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Grenade" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2023945-grenade.png"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2023945-grenade.png" alt="Grenade"></noscript></a><figcaption>Grenade</figcaption></figure></td><td><h3>Grenade</h3> The secondary weapon to the Laser's primary, the Grenade will be used by most players as the first line of defense against C/Generations, which are completely immune to laser weaponry.

      <deck><![CDATA[flOw was conceived as a college project by creator Jenova Chen, whose company later ported the game to the PlayStation Network with upgraded graphics and motion control.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p>flOw started out as a free <a href="http://intihuatani.usc.edu/cloud/flowing/" rel="nofollow">flash game</a> available online in which the player takes control of an aquatic, worm-like creature, which is controlled via the mouse. The basic mechanic of the game is to 'eat' other organisms that inhabit the environment, which causes the player's creature to grow or evolve. The creatures also have special abilities controlled by the left mouse button.</p><p>The <a data-ref-id="3045-35" href="/playstation-3/3045-35/">PlayStation 3</a> version of flOw is largely the same as the flash version, but it expands the scope of the gameplay by offering more playable creatures and <a data-ref-id="3000-9" href="/sixaxis-controller/3000-9/">SIXAXIS</a> motion control.</p><p>On October 10, 2009, a <a data-ref-id="3015-198" href="/playstation-trophies/3015-198/">trophy</a> patch was implemented.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>flOw is a game in which uses the sixaxis function of the <a data-ref-id="3000-29" href="/dualshock-3/3000-29/">DualShock 3</a> controller. You control these cellular lifeforms and eat other cells floating around the screen to make your creature grow. Throughout the game, you will take part in six different campaigns, and use your creature to go through portals to advance through different layers in the campaign. You can go through the campaign with or without eating any other cells, which will make your creature remain the same size and be more vulnerable. Also eating creatures or cells will help your creature grow, but either creatures bigger than you can also eat cells growing off your creature. The basic goal is to get to the end of the campaign with all of the creatures, and eventually getting to the credits screen, thus beating the game of flOw.</p><h2>Structure (Flash/PC version)</h2><p>The PC version features two playable creatures, these creatures, the 'snake' and the 'jellyfish' are also the first two playable creatures in the PS3 version (see below).</p><h2>Structure (PS3 version)</h2><p>flOw is loosely based around the idea of levels, but the implementation is quite far from the norm. The player can move 'up' or 'down,' in terms of depth, by eating special blue or red organisms respectively. At each level of depth, there are different organisms, some of which can be hostile. Engaging hostile creatures is never explicitly mandatory for progressing to the next level, but survival at the deeper, more difficult levels, is greatly aided by having previously advanced your creature by eating enough organisms to make it evolve.</p><h2>Playable Creatures</h2><p>There are 5 playable creatures in the main version of flOw, and an extra playable creature in the add-on pack.</p><h3>First Creature - 'Snake'</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/101967-snake3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-101967" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0" data-width="0" data-embed-type="image"><a  href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/101967-snake3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-101967"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/101967-snake3.jpg" alt="The first creature in flOw"></a><figcaption>The first creature in flOw</figcaption></figure><p>The first playable creature is snake like in appearance, growing longer as it consume more organisms. Its unique ability is a speed boost. It can increase its length, and can also develop wing-like appendages on its sides by eating certain organisms.</p><h3>Second Creature - 'Jellyfish'</h3><p>The second playable creature is round and jellyfish like. Its normal movement is fairly slow, but its special ability, a spinning maneuver that sucks in nearby organisms, allows it to build up momentum. After using its special ability, it is able to briefly move faster.</p><h3>Third Creature - 'Dolphin'</h3><p>The third playable creature has a body which loosely resembles the shape of a dolphin, but gains a long tail similar to the snake creature as it develops.</p><h3>Fourth Creature - 'Stealth Snake'</h3><p>The fourth playable creature is similar to the firs. However, its special ability is to cloak itself, and to paralyze other organisms.</p><h3>Fifth Creature - 'Predator Snake'</h3><p>The fifth playable creature is another snake like one. This one, however, it develops more aggressive looking body parts, and has the special ability to lock on other organisms and to make a sharp dash towards it, making it very easy to attack other creatures.</p><h3>Sixth Creature - 'Credit Snake'</h3><p>The sixth playable creature is yet another snake. This is the simplest of the six, as it simply grows longer with each bit of food it eats, and only has a small boost ability. The only time this creature is playable is during the credits of the game, in which the player consumes a piece of food attached to each credit.</p><h3>Seventh Creature - 'Bubble Boy'</h3><p>The seventh playable creature was added in expansion pack released for the game. This creature has the appearance of a small blob surrounded by several sections of hard shell each attached to the body of the creature by tendrils. The creature's special ability is to draw this portions of its body inward, creating a shell, granting the player temporary invulnerability.</p>]]></description>

      <deck><![CDATA[The Warriors is an action adventure 3D brawler that covers and expands the events depicted in the movie of the same name.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p>The Warriors is a <a href="/games/?sort=release_date&amp;filter_type=genre&amp;filter_value=37/">brawler</a> from <a href="/rockstar-games/3010-1194/" data-ref-id="3010-1194">Rockstar Games</a> that is based off the 1979 movie of the same title. The game begins well before the events of the movie take place, and shows how the Warriors began to build their reputation in <a href="/new-york-city/3035-109/" data-ref-id="3035-109">New York</a>. While the majority of the game is effectively a precursor to the film, the later levels do follow the events of the movie.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The game plays as a traditional <a href="/polygonal-3d/3015-1430/" data-ref-id="3015-1430">3-D</a> brawler, and includes <a href="/grapple/3015-1622/" data-ref-id="3015-1622">grapples</a>, light attacks, strong attacks, reversals/<a href="/special-counterattack/3015-4397/" data-ref-id="3015-4397">counterattacks</a>, and <a href="/block/3015-1843/" data-ref-id="3015-1843">blocks</a>. Group attacks and "Rage Mode" are part of the gameplay as well. Almost any object can be used as a weapon, or can alternatively be thrown instead.These items range from traditional makeshift weapons to bricks and other similar items, to items more bizarre such as a bong.</p><h3>Warchief Commands</h3><p>While playing as the Warchief, or leader of the Warriors, the player can give one of six commands to his soldiers. Some commands are unavailable in certain missions.</p><ul><li><b>Wreck 'Em All</b>- The Warriors focus their efforts on attacking and getting weapons.</li><li><b>Mayhem</b>-The Warriors smash anything in sight.</li><li><b>Let's Go</b>-The Warriors follow their Warchief.</li><li><b>Scatter</b>-The Warriors separate and hide from cops or enemy gangs.</li><li><b>Watch My Back</b>-The soldiers defend the player. Used while spray painting or picking a lock.</li><li><b>Hold Up</b>-The Warriors stop and defend their ground.</li></ul><h3>Multiplayer</h3><p>The game can be played entirely in co-op, but only locally. The game also has Rumble Mode which is made up of eight separate multi player modes. The modes featured are:</p><ul><li><strong>1 on 1</strong>: a two player one on one fight</li><li><strong>War Party:</strong> two gangs with five to a side</li><li><strong>Army-Ing:</strong> two gangs with nine to a side</li><li><strong>Have Mercy:</strong> a capture the flag mode</li><li><strong>Burner Battle:</strong> finish a burner while being attacked by other gangs</li><li><strong>Battle Royal:</strong> an elimanation mode</li><li><strong>Wheels of Steel:</strong> a racing mode using a wheel chair</li><li><strong>King of the HIll:</strong> stand on a platform while a timer ticks down without being knocked off</li></ul><h3>Armies of the Night</h3><p>Once the main game is completed, Armies of the Night is unlocked. This small mini-game is essentially a <a href="/2d/3015-1427/" data-ref-id="3015-1427">2D</a> brawler, very similar to <a href="/double-dragon/3025-158/" data-ref-id="3025-158">Double Dragon</a> (the opening scene is actually a direct parody of Double Dragon's opening scene).</p><h3>Unleash The Fury Mode</h3><p>This mode allows players to play the main game as the Baseball Furies. It is unlocked by beating the game 100% on Hardcore Soldier mode.</p><h2>The Warriors</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8179/438867-warriors_logo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-438867" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.74285714285714" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:74.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8179/438867-warriors_logo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-438867"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8179/438867-warriors_logo.jpg" alt="438867-warriors_logo.jpg"></a></figure><p>The Warriors are the primary gang featured in the game, and they reside over their turf in <a href="/coney-island/3035-910/" data-ref-id="3035-910">Coney Island</a>. Along with hundreds of other gangs, the Warriors are summoned to send nine delegates to a meeting where <a href="/cyrus/3005-4762/" data-ref-id="3005-4762">Cyrus</a>, leader of the most powerful gang in New York City, the Gramercy Riffs, is expected to give an important speech.</p><h3>Cleon</h3><p><a href="/cleon/3005-3522/" data-ref-id="3005-3522">Cleon</a> is the leader of the Warriors, and he is responsible for creating the gang with the help of Vermin after they were betrayed by their former gang, the Destroyers.

After a certain turn of events, Swan must step up and fulfill the role of Cleon, their fallen leader. He is calm, cool, and brave.</p><h3>Ajax</h3><p><a href="/ajax/3005-3523/" data-ref-id="3005-3523">Ajax</a> is the hot-headed muscle of the Warriors.

Vermin is more laid-back than the others, but always loyal.</p><h3>Cochise</h3><p><a href="/cochise/3005-4405/" data-ref-id="3005-4405">Cochise</a> is a soft-spoken tough guy. He was initially rejected by the Warriors because he lived in Harlem, which is the turf of a rival gang known as the Boppers. However, he boldly rises to Cleon's challenge and proves his worth.</p><h3>Fox</h3><p><a href="/fox/3005-15909/" data-ref-id="3005-15909">Fox</a> is the scout of the Warriors. He's a very observant member of the group, and provides the Warriors with valuable information.</p><h3>Snow</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/271132-warriors30.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-271132" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.7032967032967" data-width="480" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:70.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/271132-warriors30.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-271132"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/56/271132-warriors30.jpg" alt="Most of the characters are voiced by the original actors"></a><figcaption>Most of the characters are voiced by the original actors</figcaption></figure><p><a href="/snow/3005-15891/" data-ref-id="3005-15891">Snow</a> is one of the more quiet and reserved members of the Warriors, though he clearly demonstrates that he is a solid fighter.</p><h3>Cowboy</h3><p><a href="/cowboy/3005-15908/" data-ref-id="3005-15908">Cowboy</a> isn't nearly one of the strongest members of the Warriors, but he shows that he's an excellent companion.

He is not one of the nine delegates present during Cyrus' speech.</p><h2>Other Gangs</h2><p>Along with the Warriors, there are several other gangs, spanning all of <a href="/new-york-city/3035-109/" data-ref-id="3035-109">New York</a>. Many of them were featured in the movie, and all have a mission featuring them. Other gangs can also be played in the multiplayer modes.</p><p><b>Rogues</b></p><p>The Rogues, led by Luther, are a chaotic group, focused on creating mayhem just for fun. They are the main antagonists of the Warriors , due to the fact that Luther killed Cyrus and blamed the Warriors for it. Just like in the movie, the Rogues are confronted by the Warriors at Coney Island. The played must defeat the Rogues and injure Luther. Once beaten, the Riffs show up to finish off the Rogues. During the credits, the player controls the Riffs as they finish the Rogues off.</p><h3>Gramercy Riffs</h3><p>The most powerful gang in the city, led by Cyrus, are the Riffs. Cyrus plans to unite New York City's many gangs, but is killed by Luther. Luther blames the Warriors' War Chief Cleon, who is killed by the Riffs. The Riffs put a call out to the whole city to bring the Warriors to them, or kill them.</p><h3>Baseball Furies</h3><p>A silent, but intimidating group, who dress in traditional baseball attire and wear face paint. The Furies chase the Warriors around their turf many times in the game. If the game is beaten 100% on the highest difficulty, the Furies are unlocked in the story mode. They can be played in their own difficulty mode and follow the main story of the Warriors.</p><h3>Orphans</h3><p>A small-time gang from Tremont, led by Sully. The Orphans claim they defeated the Warriors, even though they didn't. To rectify this, the Warriors go to the Orphans turf and confront them. The player must destroy Sully's car and take out 40 Orphans to complete the mission.</p><h3>Hi-Hats</h3><p>Operating out of SoHo, the Hi-Hats focus on art more than gang activities.

The Warriors have to run from their bus to get to the subway.</p><p><b>Destroyers</b></p><p>Another gang from Coney Island that Cleon and Vermin used to be a part of until the leader Virgil got paranoid and tried to set the up to be killed during a drug deal. They are The Warriors main rivals.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p>Out of This World is action-adventure platforming game designed by <a href="/eric-chahi/3040-10966/" data-ref-id="3040-10966">Eric Chahi</a> for <a href="/delphine-software-international/3010-742/" data-ref-id="3010-742">Delphine Software International</a> and originally published for <a href="/amiga/3045-1/" data-ref-id="3045-1">Amiga</a> and <a href="/atari-st/3045-13/" data-ref-id="3045-13">Atari ST</a> home computers in 1991. It depicts the extraterrestrial adventures of <a href="/lester-knight-chaykin/3005-2581/" data-ref-id="3005-2581">Lester Knight Chaykin</a>, a mild-mannered scientist who is <a href="/teleportation/3015-8/" data-ref-id="3015-8">teleported</a> to a hostile alien planet as the result of a particle acceleration <a href="/experiments-gone-awry/3015-2046/" data-ref-id="3015-2046">experiment gone awry</a>. Out of This World is notable for its extensive use of <a href="/rotoscoping/3015-1249/" data-ref-id="3015-1249">rotoscoped</a> animation to provide fluid movement for the game's characters, both in cutscenes and during basic gameplay. The game's <a href="/minimalism/3015-4879/" data-ref-id="3015-4879">minimalist</a> presentation was also unique at its initial release: there is <a href="/no-hud/3015-569/" data-ref-id="3015-569">no HUD</a>, map, <a href="/high-score/3015-260/" data-ref-id="3015-260">scoring system</a> or <a href="/lives/3015-323/" data-ref-id="3015-323">lives</a>, and no ammo counter or <a href="/inventory/3015-513/" data-ref-id="3015-513">inventory</a>.</p><p>The game has several different titles based on separate release territories. It was originally published as "Another World" in Europe before being localized as "Out of This World" in North America. Additionally, the Japanese version of the game is called "Outer World".</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5052/407468-another_world1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-407468" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5052/407468-another_world1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-407468"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5052/407468-another_world1.jpg" alt="Lester's custom workstation and the particle accelerator"></a><figcaption>Lester's custom workstation and the particle accelerator</figcaption></figure><p>The player takes on the role of <a href="/lester-knight-chaykin/3005-2581/" data-ref-id="3005-2581"> Lester Knight Chaykin</a>, a young physicist conducting a particle acceleration experiment in his underground lab on a stormy night. A freak bolt of lightning directly strikes Lester's lab during the experiment, causing a large amount of electrical energy to travel into the acceleration chamber at a critical moment. Lester and his workstation both suddenly disappear from the lab in a flash of light, leaving only an electrically-charged crater behind.</p><p>In an instant, Lester finds himself somehow <a href="/teleportation/3015-8/" data-ref-id="3015-8"> teleported</a> to an alien world. After surveying his new surroundings and evading several dangerous creatures, he is soon captured and rendered unconscious by the sentient inhabitants of the planet: a race of pale, brutish humanoids. Lester later awakens inside a cage along with another alien overlooking a prison mining complex. With the aid of his fellow prisoner (unofficially known as "<a href="/buddy/3005-16252/" data-ref-id="3005-16252">Buddy</a>"), the pair secure their escape from the prison. However, security forces continue to pursue the fugitives as they flee through a sprawling alien city, forcing Lester and Buddy to split up at certain points. Even if Lester manages to survive this trial-by-fire and evade his former captors, is it possible for him to ever return home?</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5052/407735-another_world66.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-407735" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5052/407735-another_world66.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-407735"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5052/407735-another_world66.jpg" alt="Lester firing his laser pistol at a guard"></a><figcaption>Lester firing his laser pistol at a guard</figcaption></figure><p>Out of This World's gameplay employs a 2D side-view perspective, similar to most platformers released at the time. However, movement across the game's world is presented with <a href="/flip-screen/3015-2123/" data-ref-id="3015-2123">flip screens</a> as opposed to a more technically-demanding <a href="/side-scrolling/3015-299/" data-ref-id="3015-299">side-scrolling</a> technique. Lester can move left or right, run, jump, crouch, swim, and eventually wield a <a href="/laser/3055-140/" data-ref-id="3055-140"> laser pistol</a> once acquired. In addition to basic projectiles, the gun also allows Lester to fire <a href="/charge/3015-1060/" data-ref-id="3015-1060">charged</a> shots and create <a href="/energy-force-shield/3055-644/" data-ref-id="3055-644">force shields</a>. Because Lester cannot survive most direct enemy attacks (though the game's laser-wielding aliens will often miss Lester), precision and care are recommended when engaging armed foes. It is even possible for Lester to deplete his laser pistol's energy, requiring players to seek out a recharge station to restore the gun's functionality.</p><p>The game includes a password system, allowing players to continue their game from a<a href="/checkpoints/3015-292/" data-ref-id="3015-292"> checkpoint</a>. There are several areas where the player must solve complex <a href="/puzzles/3015-932/" data-ref-id="3015-932"> puzzles</a> in order to proceed, often involving trial-and-error.</p><h2>Setting</h2><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5052/407523-another_world20.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-407523" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5052/407523-another_world20.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-407523"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="An alien city that serves as the game's primary setting" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5052/407523-another_world20.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5052/407523-another_world20.jpg" alt="An alien city that serves as the game's primary setting"></noscript></a><figcaption>An alien city that serves as the game's primary setting</figcaption></figure><p>Because there are no explanatory <a href="/cutscene/3015-22/" data-ref-id="3015-22"> cutscenes</a> or dialogue in Out of This World, the game's alien setting and its history are entirely left up to the player to infer from their immediate surroundings. From the outset, the region of the world where the game takes place seems to be arid and largely desolate, and the native flora and fauna encountered by Lester is uniformly brutal and predatory. The planet's sentient life forms appear to condone forced labor and <a href="/gladiators/3015-3247/" data-ref-id="3015-3247">gladiatorial</a> events, as evidenced by the prison mining complex and coliseum areas; these institutions suggest a culture similar to that of the ancient <a href="/roman-empire/3015-7127/" data-ref-id="3015-7127">Roman Empire</a>. The city's buildings could also be compared to traditional <a href="/middle-east/3035-1904/" data-ref-id="3035-1904">middle-eastern</a> structures.</p><p>Though their culture may seem primitive by human standards, the aliens' technology is far more advanced in some key areas. They seem to possess a greater understanding of energy and how to harness it, evident in the "power nodes" dotted around the city that can instantly recharge Lester's gun. The aliens' laser-based weaponry also takes advantage of their energy mastery, which can <a href="/stun/3015-1577/" data-ref-id="3015-1577"> stun</a> on the lowest setting or instantly incinerate organic targets, leaving only a charred skeleton behind.</p><h2>Development</h2><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/913/953794-rotoscoping.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-953794" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75070821529745" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/913/953794-rotoscoping.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-953794"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Rotoscoping models for Lester's gun and sports car used during development" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/913/953794-rotoscoping.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/913/953794-rotoscoping.jpg" alt="Rotoscoping models for Lester's gun and sports car used during development"></noscript></a><figcaption>Rotoscoping models for Lester's gun and sports car used during development</figcaption></figure><p>Animation of the principle characters was performed through a process called <a href="/rotoscoping/3015-1249/" data-ref-id="3015-1249"> rotoscoping</a>, whereby real objects were used as models for animation work, lending a life-like and quirky feel to the movement that might seem flat and predictable if animated through simple physics models. Lester's appearance is supposedly based on <a href="/eric-chahi/3040-10966/" data-ref-id="3040-10966"> Eric Chahi</a>, the game's designer. However, because Chahi found it disturbing to view himself as a character in the game, he decided to alter Lester's appearance and depicted him as a redhead instead.</p><p>Out of This World was originally released for <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94"> PC</a>, <a href="/amiga/3045-1/" data-ref-id="3045-1"> Amiga</a>, <a href="/atari-st/3045-13/" data-ref-id="3045-13"> Atari</a>, <a href="/mac/3045-17/" data-ref-id="3045-17"> Macintosh</a>, <a href="/3do/3045-26/" data-ref-id="3045-26"> 3DO</a>, <a href="/snes/3045-9/" data-ref-id="3045-9"> SNES</a>, <a href="/genesis/3045-6/" data-ref-id="3045-6"> Genesis</a> and the <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/sega-cd/3045-29/" data-ref-id="3045-29">Sega CD</a>. The Atari and Amiga versions were developed first. They are relatively shorter compared to later versions, and have a higher <a href="/difficulty-level/3015-183/" data-ref-id="3015-183"> difficulty level</a> due to more precise timing required of the player. The PC version was the first to introduce a whole new level in the middle to latter third of the game to help lengthen the game and strengthen the narrative.</p><p>Further obstacles were added for the Genesis and SNES console ports, as <a href="/interplay-entertainment-corp/3010-580/" data-ref-id="3010-580"> Interplay</a> purportedly wanted players to get as much gameplay as possible for their dollar. <a href="/nintendo/3010-90/" data-ref-id="3010-90"> Nintendo</a> also had demands about certain scenes which were considered to be inappropriate for minors (which amounted to a few pixels worth of deletions during a bathhouse scene; as well as changing reddish ichor, which might be interpreted as blood, to green).</p><p>The Sega CD version of the game included a game set in the same world, dubbed <a href="/heart-of-the-alien-out-of-this-world-parts-i-and-ii/3030-17785/" data-ref-id="3030-17785"> Out of this World 2: Heart of the Alien</a>, which took place from the point of view of the aliens. Eric Chahi has stated, however, that this in-house Interplay project suffers in terms of animation quality and its value as a game, as he was not involved in the project.</p><p>Eric Chahi has stated that the problem with some of the early enhanced versions was that the backgrounds were a lot easier to improve than the characters themselves. In order to enhance the characters, new rotoscoping or detailed, frame-by-frame enhancement of the animations would have to be done, while the backdrops could be repainted with relative ease. Doing the latter without the former, though, would result in the characters in the foreground looking flat. For the 3DO version, Chahi says, this is especially apparent.</p><p>The enhancement of the animations themselves could probably not be done because processors of the time could not handle so many frames of animation being very detailed, although currently such restrictions are negligible.</p><p>In addition to the listed versions, there were also unofficial ports to both the <a href="/game-boy-advance/3045-4/" data-ref-id="3045-4"> GBA</a> and <a href="/gamepark-32/3045-133/" data-ref-id="3045-133">GamePark 32</a> systems.</p><h2>Sequel</h2><p>Despite potential interest in a sequel, Chahi himself has stated that he would prefer the story of Out of This World to have no official continuation. He maintains that preserving the ambiguous ending is important to reinforce the game's sense of mystery:</p><blockquote><p>"I think the story is complete. It has a lot of mystery, so doing a sequel would be very tricky. It could break the magic it has."</p><cite>Eric Chahi interview from Retro Gamer issue# 96, 2011</cite></blockquote><p>A sequel to Out of this World was developed for the <a href="/sega-cd/3045-29/" data-ref-id="3045-29">Sega CD</a> in 1994 called <a href="/heart-of-the-alien-out-of-this-world-parts-i-and-ii/3030-17785/" data-ref-id="3030-17785"> Heart of the Alien</a>, which starred Buddy as the main protagonist instead of Lester. However, Chahi was not involved with this sequel's development and has dismissed the events of Heart of the Alien as non-canonical in the context of the original game's story.</p><h2>Re-releases &amp; Remakes</h2><p>A higher-resolution version of Out of This World is available from creator Eric Chahi on <a href="http://www.anotherworld.fr/anotherworld_uk/index.htm" rel="nofollow"> his website.</a> This version has more detailed backgrounds, multiple graphics modes, additional save points and features compatibility with Windows XP and Vista.</p><p>Telco Games also distributes a mobile phone version of the game.</p><h3>15th Anniversary Edition</h3><p>The 15th Anniversary Edition is also available from GOG.com and comes with a selection of extra content, including:</p><ul><li>Manual (17 pages)</li><li>2 HD wallpapers</li><li>Development diary</li><li>Technical handbook</li><li>Soundtrack</li><li>"Making Of" video</li></ul><h3>20th Anniversary Edition</h3><p>In 2011, in commemoration of its 20th anniversary, Out of This World was made available for the iOS (iPhone and iPad) and later Android.

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter is a third person action/platformer played in a series of linear levels. The game is a mix of traditional shooting and platforming.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1707/430323-bountyhunter_03.gif" data-ref-id="1300-430323" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1707/430323-bountyhunter_03.gif" data-ref-id="1300-430323"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1707/430323-bountyhunter_03.gif" alt="Your jetpack and pistols are frequently used in combat."></a><figcaption>Your jetpack and pistols are frequently used in combat.</figcaption></figure><p>The shooting features a targeting system which allows you to lock onto your opponents and see their health. Jango Fett is armed with a large number of weapons, including his trademark duel pistols which allow him to shoot at 2 targets at the same time. He can shoot a dart from his suit as seen in <em>Star Wars: Episode 2: Attack of the Clones.</em> He can shoot rockets from his jet pack as also seen in the film. Some weapons have limited ammo. At certain points in the game, you will lose some or all of your weapons and must use your fists. The player gains weapons which include a flamethrower, a machine gun, and a sniper rifle. Jango Fett also has a targeting computer inside his visor which allows him to identify wanted criminals, and gain information about their history. The game gives you a choice to either capture or kill the target, with more credits awarded if captured alive. The game keeps track of how many credits you get for each bounty and totals it at the end of the game.</p><p>The platforming sections mainly involve the use of your jet pack. You can also shoot while using the jet pack. A bar indicates how much longer it can stay in the air. The jet pack is not as useful for stealth however, as it creates a lot of noise and alerts your enemies. It can be useful when trying to dodge gunfire.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>The game takes place shortly after the events of Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace. begins with Darth Tyranus contacting Darth Sidious. Sidious is unhappy with Tyranus for not eliminating the cult group, Bando Gora, when he had the chance. This group is a threat to Tyranus and his goals. He also expresses his desire to create a clone army. He then decides to kill two (metaphorical) birds with one (metaphorical) stone and eliminate the Bando Gora and find a suitable candidate for his cloning program.</p><p>Meanwhile, Jango Fett is hunting a criminal, Meeko Ghintee, for his friend Rozatt. After the capture, Jango receives a transmission from Darth Tyranus inviting him to participate in "a special hunt... for a special prey." The reward is five million credits for the capture of the deranged leader of the Bando Gora, Komari Vosa.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3971/261755-bounty_3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-261755" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3971/261755-bounty_3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-261755"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3971/261755-bounty_3.jpg" alt="The game featured various environments including city themed areas."></a><figcaption>The game featured various environments including city themed areas.</figcaption></figure><p>Jango arrives at the Merchant Row. He manages to capture one of Meeko's thugs, who leads him to Meeko. Meeko sends all of his thugs after Jango. He claims he will award triple pay to the one that kills him. Jango fights his way through many thugs before witnessing Meeko steal a speeder and flying away. After a long pursuit, Meeko loses control of his speeder and crashes. He escapes, however, by heading into the docking bays. More of his thugs await for Jango there. Jango fights his way through the bay before finally reaching Meeko. Meeko, however, has gotton a hold of another ship. More thugs arrive also. Jango, however, manages to cause enough damage to ship, making it crash. Meeko survives the crash, but is captured by Jango Fett.</p><p>The game cuts to another bounty hunter, Montross, who is hunting a criminal who is marked dead or alive. Montross states, "You're worth enough, dead." before killing him. After this, we see Jango has arrived home. He collects his money from his boss, Rozatta, or Ross. Ross also tells Jango that a transmission came for him. It was from Count Dooku, informing him that he was one of the few bounty hunters selected on a hunt. The reward was 5 million republic credits. The prey was Komari Vosa, the leader of the Bando Gora. Jango accepts the offer, despite Rosses warnings not to, as she knows how dangerous the Bando Gora are. She also suspects Montross may be invloved. Montross does, in fact, receive the same transmission.</p><p>Jango's first target is Coruscant. Ross gives information about Jevis Gloom, a wanted death stick dealer. Jango decides to try and collect this bounty, while also interrogating him for information on the Bando Gora. Jango lands in the entertainment distract. Gloom's thugs are aware of his presence and slowly start to attack Jango. Jango locates Gloom, but he escapes. He finally tracks him down to a bar. After Jango pulls a gun on the bartender, he forces him to bring down the elevater where Gloom is hiding. He captures gloom and depends info in the Bando Gora. He directs him to his boss, Groff Haugg. He even allows Jango to use his speeder to get to him.</p><p>Jango lands in the facility. He is not inisually discovered because the ship is Glooms, but Jango soon opens fire on the workers, who are armed, and creates chaos. Along the way, Jango finds death sticks, but suspects that they are not actually death sticks. He asks Ross to test them in which she finds that the deathsticks are much differnet, and take control of the person's mind. These are used to convert people to the Bando Gora. He locates Hogg, dead. Montross gets to him first. This is first meeting of Jango and Montross in the game. After a battle, Montross escapes. After looking at recent transmissions, he finds that Senetor Trell has been dealing with Hogg. That is his next target.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5973/264735-50.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-264735" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5973/264735-50.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-264735"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="As a bounty hunter, Jango Fett is tasked with capturing various crooks." class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5973/264735-50.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5973/264735-50.jpg" alt="As a bounty hunter, Jango Fett is tasked with capturing various crooks."></noscript></a><figcaption>As a bounty hunter, Jango Fett is tasked with capturing various crooks.</figcaption></figure><p>The senetor is located in the Upper City. Jango fights his way through Republic security, and finally gets to the senetor. After interigation, he learns that the death sticks were aquired from a dug named Subolto. His interigations are cut short, when a republic ship locates Jango, and orders him to release the senetor in which Jango throws the senetor off the muli-story building. Jango eventually destorys the ship and makes his escape. Jango learns that Sebolto has posted a a bounty on one Bendix Fust. Jango plans to capture Fust, and bring him to Sobolto as a gift, and then try and get into from him. Fex is located in an astroid prison. Jango enters the facility by disguising himself as an astroid.</p><p>He fights his way through the facility, and gets to Fest. However, another bounty hunter, Zam Wessal, captures him first. All of the cell doors are opened, and a riot occurs. For some reason, the prisoners target Jango as he fights his way through the prison. Zam plans to steal Jangos ship, however it is destroyed. Zam and Jango are forced to work together to steal one of the ships. Jango destorys the shield generator and steals one of the Firspray prototypes with Zam and Fest onboard. He later renames the ship, Slave 1. He also destorys the prison by firing missils.</p><p>Jango allows Zam to accompany him in the hunt. They plan to drop Jango off at the surface, where he fights his way through the jungle. Zam visits Sobolto and convinces him to let her stay. Eventually, Jango meets up with Zam in the lowers village. She mensions a secret passage as they set off together. Jango finds out that the the Bando Gora are dealing with the hutts. They also meet the Bando Gora for the first time, killing them. Sobolto is chased into the death stick factory. Upon entering, Jango sees Sobolto fall deep into the facility, where he boiled alive.</p><p>After this, Jango travels to Tatooine to visit the hutts. A faction war is going on between Jabba and Gardulla the Hutts. Ross suggests that they should presnet a gift to one of the hutts in order to find out which one is working with the Bando Gora. Longo Two-Guns is wanted by Jabba, and is their selection for a gift. Gardulla is more of a reculse. The heat causes Jango's jet pack to malfunction, so he has to leave it behind.. Two-Guns is located in a speeder hanger where he is capturedd by Jango. Jabba says that Gardulla houses the Bando Gora in her lair, which is Jango's next target.</p><p>Upon landing on a cliffside, Jango contacts Zam. She informs him that she isn't sure if she can get inside the palace. She is heard struggling with someone as her transmission is cut off. Jango fights his way through the canyon. Jango finds Zam who can't be released as it would alert the guards. Zam thinks he is just leaving her for dead so he won't have to deal with her. She yells for the guards, and Jango is captured. Gardulla captures Jango and puts him in a pit with a krayt dragon. He escapes the dragon and finds his equipment. Later, he kills the dragon. He leaves Zam behind as he escapes.</p><p>Jango learns that Montross has attacked Jango's home and his left Ross for dead. He swears to kill Montross and tries to save Ross. Ross says that detenators have been set in the facility and warns him to get off and leave her there. She dies in the explosion. Before she dies, however, she gives him the location of the Bando Gora. He lands there and finds Montross, and fights him. He kills Montross and sets to kill Vosa also. He is captured by Vosa while fighting his way through however. Jango is torchured and is demanded answers of who hired him by Vosa. Zam arrives on the scene, who somehow escaped the hutt and followed Jango. She draws her blaster and begins to fire at Vosa, who deflects the bullets with her dual, curved lightsabers. One of the deflected shots hits her in arm, however she manages to free Jango by shooting the chains. Jango picks up with blasters and chases her back deeper into the palace.</p><p>Jango fights with Vosa, avoiding her lightsabers. Eventually, after a long hard battle, he shoots Vosa down, severly wounded. Jango decides wether he wants to turn her in dead or alive before Count Dooku interupts him by force choking Vosa, killing her. Count keeps his promise to give Jango 5 million credits, while also offering him something else. He requests that Jango be the the clone model for a huge army. Jango agrees, but under one condition. He must have the first clone unaltered for himself. After brief questioning, Dooku agrees. The game ends with Jango carrying a wounded Zam torwards his ship. She asks Jango if the money will be split in which Jango answers, "Don't try your luck."</p><h3>Alternate ending:</h3><p>There are two alternate endings. The first happens if Montross defeats Jango in their final battle. Montross looks at Jango's body and says, "Save a spot for me in hell." The second occurs if Vosa defeats Jango. She leaps unto Jango's shoulders and decapitates him, similar to the way he dies in the movie.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<h2 style="margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;">Overview</h2><p data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Renegade is a beat 'em up game using 2D sprites that can move in three dimensions. It uses a system of a fixed location where the player has to fend off waves of opponents until their numbers dwindle, and the stage boss appears to intervene. Two sequels to Renegade were made: <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/target-renegade/3030-9769/" data-ref-id="3030-9769">Target: Renegade</a> and <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/renegade-iii-the-final-chapter/3030-9994/" data-ref-id="3030-9994">Renegade 3: The Final Chapter</a>. Neither of the sequels were developed by <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/technos-japan-corp/3010-452/" data-ref-id="3010-452">Technos</a>.</p><p data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Renegade (as an arcade game) is notable for being a western localization of Nekketsu Kōha <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/kunio-kun/3025-858/" data-ref-id="3025-858">Kunio-kun</a>. The notability is that the sprite and stage changes are heavily influenced by the 1979 film '<a href="//www.giantbomb.com/the-warriors/3025-2124/" data-ref-id="3025-2124">The Warriors</a>'. No lawsuit was ever made against the game for such similarities.</p><p data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Renegade uses various combat techniques that were progressive for beat-em ups of its era. These included reverse attacks (attacking an opponent behind the player), grab attacks and the ability to 'mount' and attack downed enemies. It could be argued that even much later games in the style, such as <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/final-fight/3025-195/" data-ref-id="3025-195">Final Fight</a>, were influenced by Renegade.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p>MagMax is a side-scrolling shooter in which the player controls the eponymous MagMax, a ship capable of transforming into a giant robot should it reconnect with its various pieces found across each level. The game switches from an isometric view while on the surface to a more standard side-scrolling view whenever MagMax travels underground.</p><p>When MagMax finds a piece of its robot form, the piece joins onto the ship and provides the player with additional firepower. It will also take a hit and be destroyed in place of the player's ship, providing a secondary use as a free hit. Should the player find all the pieces, the MagMax's robotic form is quite formidable in combat and can even change its main weapon between a laser drill, fireballs and other powerful weapons.</p><p>The game was Nihon Bussan's first NES title. Nihon Bussan was, at the time, a minor player in the Arcade market, producing games like <a href="/terra-cresta/3030-1272/" data-ref-id="3030-1272">Terra Cresta</a>. They would continue producing NES titles for much of the system's lifespan.</p><p>In April 2015, the Arcade version of MagMax was released on Japanese PSN by <a href="/hamster-corporation/3010-4703/" data-ref-id="3010-4703">Hamster</a>, joining their <a href="/arcade-archives/3025-3081/" data-ref-id="3025-3081">Arcade Archives</a> collection.</p>]]></description>

Two monsters face each other in locations like a city or a power plant, and much of the environment can be used to attack. The fighting plays out in three dimensions, and the arenas are quite large, allowing combatants a lot of space to roam around. Large parts of the scenery are also destructible. Throwing another monster into a building will cause it to collapse.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7772/589074-war_of_the_mosnters.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-589074" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.77430555555556" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:77.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7772/589074-war_of_the_mosnters.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-589074"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7772/589074-war_of_the_mosnters.jpg" alt="Golem-on-robot violence"></a><figcaption>Golem-on-robot violence</figcaption></figure><p>The single-player mode follows each monster through a monster movie-inspired story, where the player will face both standard fighters and occasional bosses that require unique strategies. Unlike most fighting games, the action in single-player is seen from a wide, behind-the-back perspective, and the camera is freely adjustable. Completing the Adventure mode with each monster unlocks a short video that tells the monster's origin story. The unlockable characters, Raptros and Zorgulon, do not have origin videos.</p><p>The multiplayer mode in War of the Monsters supports only 2 players at once. Due to the size of the stages, the match is displayed in <a href="/split-screen-multiplayer/3015-322/" data-ref-id="3015-322">split screen</a> unless the players are quite close to each other, in which case the two characters are shown from a side view.<a href="/split-screen-multiplayer/3015-322/" data-ref-id="3015-322"><br /></a></p><h2>Plot</h2><p>In order to counter an alien invasion in the 1950s, scientists from around the world join forces in order to create a shockwave-producing weapon that short-circuits the flying saucers, causing them to crash. Unbeknownst to them, the saucers are powered by a radioactive liquid, which leaks from the debris of the ships and gives birth to giant monsters.</p><h2>Characters</h2><ul><li><a href="/agamo/3005-6737/" data-ref-id="3005-6737">Agamo</a>: A tiki god made of stone and lava.

It is a third person action-adventure game based heavily on Greek Mythology. The main character, Kratos, is a fallen spartan general who must solve puzzles, traverse dangerous locales and kill anything that gets in his way.</p><p>In this installment we find Kratos riding on the back of the <a href="/titan/3015-2302/" data-ref-id="3015-2302"> Titan</a> <a href="/gaia/3005-1317/" data-ref-id="3005-1317"> Gaia</a>, the mother of all titans as he climbs <a href="/olympus/3035-259/" data-ref-id="3035-259"> Mount Olympus</a> in order to get his revenge against his father, <a href="/zeus/3005-1101/" data-ref-id="3005-1101"> Zeus</a>. This journey takes him through a variety of mythycial places such as the <a href="/underworld/3035-1756/" data-ref-id="3035-1756"> Underworld</a> home of Hades, the City of Olympia and even inside <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Olympus" rel="nofollow"> Mount Olympus</a> itself.</p><p>God of War III was launched originally on March 16th, 2010 in the US followed closely by Australia on March 18th, 2010 and on March 19th, 2010 for European Countries.</p><h2><b>Story</b></h2><p>The story picks up directly after the end of God of War II with <a href="/kratos/3005-645/" data-ref-id="3005-645"> Kratos</a> riding on top of the <a href="/gaia/3005-1317/" data-ref-id="3005-1317"> Titan Gaia</a>, headed towards <a href="/olympus/3035-259/" data-ref-id="3035-259"> Mount Olympus</a>, so that Kratos can get his revenge on <a href="/zeus/3005-1101/" data-ref-id="3005-1101"> Zeus</a>. Standing with Zeus is <a href="/poseidon/3005-1347/" data-ref-id="3005-1347"> Poseidon</a>, <a href="/hermes/3005-4421/" data-ref-id="3005-4421"> Hermes</a>, <a href="/hades/3005-1294/" data-ref-id="3005-1294"> Hades</a>, and <a href="/helios/3005-11259/" data-ref-id="3005-11259"> Helios</a>. During this scene, Poseidon attacks Gaia impeding the Titans ability to climb Mount Olympus. Kratos is then able to kill Poseidon. Soon after, Gaia along with Kratos are able to reach the top of mount Olympus only to be pushed off by Zeus.</p><p>Kratos lands in the river of Styx, where his powers are drained, he than meets Athena's ghost. She gives him the <a href="/blades-of-exile/3055-4107/" data-ref-id="3055-4107"> Blades of Exile</a> and helps Kratos on his journey to kill Zeus. Kratos soon learns that Pandora's Box still exists with the power to kill a God even after <a href="/ares/3005-1098/" data-ref-id="3005-1098"> Ares</a> died. The box is protected by the Flame of Olympus and the only way to put out the flame and reach the box, is to sacrifice <a href="/pandora/3005-14625/" data-ref-id="3005-14625"> Pandora</a>. However, Pandora is being held in a Labyrinth. Once Kratos finds her he takes her up to the flame and makes the sacrifice. Once he opens the box he realizes that it is empty and that he just killed a child for nothing, just as he killed his family in vain. This leaves Kratos with another regret on his mind. After this, Kratos kills Zeus. However, his spirit is still alive and attacks Kratos. Kratos then goes into his own mind and finds hope inside him, forgiving himself for all of the bad things that he had done in his life. Including the killing of <a href="/athena/3005-1145/" data-ref-id="3005-1145"> Athena</a>, his Wife, his Daughter and Pandora. Once Kratos returns from inside his own mind, he kills Zeus for good.</p><p>Athena tells Kratos that when he first opened Pandora's box he let out all of the good and bad things in it, the good power was the power of hope. The bad powers in the box corrupted the God and Athena's power went to Kratos. This is why after the box was opened for the first time Zeus was corrupted by fear, and he became obsessed with killing Kratos. Athena then tells Kratos that she wants her power back, Kratos refuses then impales himself with the sword of Olympus, releasing the power for the whole world to use and angering Athena. Kratos is now then left dead on the ground in a pool of blood.</p><p>Once the credits are done rolling, you see the place where Kratos was lying dead, however there is a blood trail leading off the edge of a cliff with no body in sight, potentially leaving room for another sequel.</p><h2>The David Jaffe Plot Cut</h2><p>In an interview with GameTrailers David Jaffe explained that he had a completely different plot line for God of War 3. In his version the game would start off with a boss fight between Kratos and Zeus which at the end of it Zeus gets killed by Kratos. The moment Zeus dies we would see all the other god from other mythologies, mainly Norse and Egyptian, appear in Mount. Olympus since the death of Zeus left a sort of power vacuum in Mount. Olympus. The other gods would then start fighting amongst themselves in order to figure out who will take over the world. Kratos would then meet his egyptian and norse counterparts who would explained to him that they too have been seeking vengeance on the gods and would then merge their powers together in order to give them a better chance at winning. Kratos then realizes that in order to kill the gods you need to make mortals stop believing in them. Without realizing Kratos' plan was already in effect. Because the gods were too busy with their infighting they forgot about the mortal world and as such the world started getting plagued with all sorts of natural disasters. In their absence the people's prayers for salvation go unanswered and because of that the people stopped believing in the gods. This gives all three versions of kratos' the edge they needed and they proceeds to kill gods from various mythologies. The game would end after all the gods were dead some killed by the Titans and some were killed by the egyptian and norse version of Kratos and the Titans restoring order to the world. Kratos would then commit suicide by his blades in order to be with his family and to finally be at peace. The final scene in the game would be the player controlling the three wise men following the north star (there a picture which depicts this scene in God of War 2) and thus the birth of a new religion.</p><p>In this version would have seen kratos fighting the mighty gorgon <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stheno" rel="nofollow"> Stheno</a> and eventually chopping off her head in accordance with the Rule of Three (In previous games Kratos killed Stheno younger sisters <a href="/euryale/3005-1300/" data-ref-id="3005-1300"> Euryale</a> and <a href="/medusa/3005-1100/" data-ref-id="3005-1100"> Medusa</a>). The game would have also feature the sphinx as a boss fight with Kratos fighting him then using the Head of Stheno in order to to turn the sphinx into stone which would explain his present location. The game would have also feature Kratos fighting Thor and Ra.</p><h2><b>Gameplay</b></h2><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10024/837774-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-837774" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.83333333333333" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:83.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10024/837774-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-837774"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10024/837774-4.jpg" alt="Kratos wearing the Cestus"></a><figcaption>Kratos wearing the Cestus</figcaption></figure><p>The gameplay is reminiscent of previous games in the series, consisting of battling a variety of gruesome enemies with a range of weapons and magical attacks.</p><p>Kratos is able to mount giant Cyclopes and use them in a vehicular fashion to take out enemies, or he can jump and grab flying enemies, kill them, and dive bomb back to the ground sending enemies flying into the air. A small portion of the game takes place while Kratos is riding the enormous Titans, and therefore the levels dynamically change and move around based on how the Titans are climbing or moving. If they stand up, the level suddenly becomes a vertical playing field and so on. Another interesting not is that the enemy is already much better then previous games, however if there is a field commander present at the location that Kratos is currently in, the enemies will fight even harder and attempt to flank Kratos. An example of the field commanders that have already been shown is the Centaur.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/888268-2uzqh3b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-888268" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/888268-2uzqh3b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-888268"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="You will die!" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/19745/888268-2uzqh3b.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/19745/888268-2uzqh3b.jpg" alt="You will die!"></noscript></a><figcaption>You will die!</figcaption></figure><p>Similar to the head of the Medusa from the original game, Kratos acquires the head of the God Helios which has a couple of uses that Kratos will exploit. The first one is that the head reveals hidden doors that were cloaked from view, thanks to the wide sunbeams that are projected from his mouth. The second use for the head is as a lantern. Another item that you will obtain in God of War III is the Boots of Hermes. These are described in the game as, "Shoes taken from the messenger of the gods. They grant the gift of agility." With these Boots you are able to run along side of walls and up walls that would be impossible to jump up. Kratos will also have the Bow of Apollo, a fiery bow that once belonged to the God Apollo. With this bow you can set fire to some objects that block your path. You can also use this against enemies, you can set them on fire by charging up the bow or you can quickly tap the button to fire rapidly.</p><p>All of the weapons in God of War III have a grapple attack. With this all new attack you can throw yourself towards an enemy. Every weapon in the game is able to use this attack. It is performed by holding the L1 button and pressing .</p><h2>Weapons</h2><h3>Blades of Exile</h3><p>These blades will be your most powerful ally against Olympus. They are Kratos' signature weapons, similar to his weapons in the first and second games: Blades of Chaos and Blades of Athena. They are given to you by Athena.</p><p><b>Magic attack:</b></p><p>Summons a dome of shields that fall from the sky, damaging all nearby enemies. Spears then thrust from the shields in all directions, damaging all enemies at a further range. Upon further upgrading, a prompt will appear telling the player to repeatedly press the button, causing a flurry of arrows to fall from the sky, again damaging all enemies at an even further range.</p><h3><b>Claws of Hades</b></h3><p>Taken from Lord Hades, these cruel hooks grant you power over souls. This purple weapon is very similar to the Blades of Exile, as they have chains that allow for a longer range and wider area. They also differ in speed, as the Claws are a bit faster and less powerful than the Blades of Exile.</p><p><b>Magic attack:</b></p><p>Summons souls from fallen enemies to attack for you, you start with three basic souls and gain three with each upgrade.</p><h3>Nemean Cestus</h3><p>Flamed Gauntlets given to Hercules when he slew the Nemean Lion. Short Range, slow and very powerful. Taken from Hercules's corpse.</p><p><b>Magic attack:</b></p><p>This weapon slams the Gauntlets down to the ground sending a shockwave out in front of Kratos.</p><h3>Nemesis Whip</h3><p>Crafted from the Omphalos stone by the smith God Hephaestus. This weapon carries electricity and is able to charge certain objects with electricity in the environment and is used in one small puzzle.</p><p><b>Magic attack:</b></p><p>This weapon zaps your enemies with a bolt of electricity.</p><h2>Extras</h2><p>Like every God of War game, there are a handful of extra's that you can watch or complete after you beat the main game the first time through. A list of challenges, called "The Challenges of Olympus" is unlocked after your first play through, and a Combat Arena is unlocked after you complete all of the challenges. There is also a documentary video that shows the development of God of War 3 in the extras menu. Also, there are many additional costumes Kratos can gain, unfortunately the only one unlocked from playing the actual game is the fear costume. The other costumes are Apollo, Phantom of Chaos, Forgotten Warrior, Dominus, and Morpheus Armor, these are gained through preorders/promotions with Amazon, Gamestop, Gamecrazy, The Ultimate God of War 3 box, and slurpee.com respectively. An additional game difficulty, Chaos Difficulty, is unlocked after the first play through on any other difficulty.</p><h2>Information</h2><p><a href="/cory-barlog/3040-63532/" data-ref-id="3040-63532"> Cory Barlog</a> wrote the overarching story of how the trilogy ends as well as the base of the game layout and design. Barlog also mentioned at a God of War II launch event that this game would run at full 1080p resolution, though it turned out that the final version will run natively in 720p with the ability to upscale to 1080p. The game also supports rumble functions. Barlog also expressed an interest in adding a cooperative mode, but this and the SIXAXIS controls were not put into the final product.</p><p><a href="/david-jaffe/3040-44184/" data-ref-id="3040-44184"> David Jaffe</a> has said of the story that, "God of War explains, or ultimately will explain, why there are no more Greek myths." He has also stated that it will be "hell on earth" as the Gods and the Titans battle each other for domination, and that the series will explore the question of whether "man needs god". David Jaffe has expressed interest to be involved in some way with the development of God of War III, but since he left <a href="/sony-computer-entertainment-america/3010-313/" data-ref-id="3010-313"> SCEA</a> his influence would be minimal. Barlog has since left SCEA and has stated that the development changes that go on in God of War are, "outta my control now ". <a href="/stig-asmussen/3040-42647/" data-ref-id="3040-42647"> Stig Asmussen</a> has taken over the role of director. Asmussen revealed to Gamepro that the endings to the series, under both Jaffe and Barlog, would have been drastically different than what he implemented in God of War III. In Jaffe's ending Kratos would kill Zeus and right around the corner would be Norse Mythology. In Barlog's ending Kratos would become <a href="/death/3005-955/" data-ref-id="3005-955"> Death</a> himself and his blades would turn into sickles resembling Death's <a href="/scythe/3055-95/" data-ref-id="3055-95"> scythe</a>.</p><ul><li>Unlike the first two iterations in the series where there were only 15 enemies on screen, there will now be up to 50 this time.</li><li>Enemies can also jump on Kratos, eventually weighing him down and smothering him. This can be broken by wiggling the analogue stick.</li></ul><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/888635-73j62t.png" data-ref-id="1300-888635" data-size="large" style="width: 960px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="960" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/888635-73j62t.png" data-ref-id="1300-888635"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Example of Kratos breaking out of a pile-up." class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/19745/888635-73j62t.png"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/19745/888635-73j62t.png" alt="Example of Kratos breaking out of a pile-up."></noscript></a><figcaption>Example of Kratos breaking out of a pile-up.</figcaption></figure><ul><li>You can ride monsters like the Cyclops and “control” them.</li></ul><ul><li>Kratos on the PlayStation 2 used 5,000 polygons, where as now he uses 20,000.</li></ul><ul><li>Weapons have been added and enhanced to improve variety.

It functions primarily as a third-person shooter with an <a href="/over-the-shoulder/3015-2621/" data-ref-id="3015-2621">over-the-shoulder</a> perspective, only players cannot simultaneously move and shoot. This then gives the game a more methodical feel that prioritises accuracy and crowd management rather than commonly hunkering behind cover or running &amp; gunning. Though while there is in fact a cover system, it is relatively rudimentary and is only accessible at specific segments -- most notably during when enemies that can shoot back such as Soldier Majini are introduced. When available, players can pop-out to fire, but cannot shimmy along nor dive between different pieces of cover.</p><p>For as much as RE5 resembles RE4, it still nonetheless carves out its own identity by way of its faster pace and more action-orientated focus. Puzzles have been near-completely removed, and RE5 has adopted a more modern shooter control scheme that by default has players aim with L1/LB and shoot with R1/RB. Characters can now slowly strafe left or right as well, though amongst the four variable control schemes exists the 'Classic' Type D, which has RE5 control much like RE4. However that also includes removing the player's ability to strafe. A basic map in the top right corner of the screen can be displayed by pressing R2/RT. It won't disclose the information of enemy locations, but will at least visualise the blueprint-like design of the area.</p><p>The story is now told almost-exclusively via in-game cutscenes this time around, though nearing the later segments there are still a number of Files (diaries, memos ect.) that shed light on the series' backstory and mythos.</p><p>The most notary change from RE4 is the addition of a secondary character that persists throughout the whole game, in both single-player and cooperative formats. (See further below for more details)</p><h3>Inventory &amp; Shop</h3><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637083-resident_evil_5_pc_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2637083" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637083-resident_evil_5_pc_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2637083"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="The in-game inventory display" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637083-resident_evil_5_pc_02.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637083-resident_evil_5_pc_02.jpg" alt="The in-game inventory display"></noscript></a><figcaption>The in-game inventory display</figcaption></figure><p>Possibly the most notable overhaul is the inventory system. Long gone is the tetris-like inventory management of Resident Evil 4, and in its stead is a new format that is presented as a grid made up of nine squares -- each of which can hold any type of weapon or item. Players press triangle/Y to bring up their inventory, where they can then choose to move around their items into whichever square they desire. However inventory management is done in real time, and players cannot move whilst in their inventory leaving them potentially vulnerable to attack. To compensate, players can now once again reload their weapons via their inventory screen--by moving ammo towards the hypothetical weapon square--as opposed to only being able to do so manually like in RE4. Due to the animation-priority concerning certain actions, this allows players to reload their weapons or move items around while the character is climbing a ladder or opening a door for example. The speed with which the inventory menu can be opened &amp; closed attributes to this factor also.</p><p>Another benefit is with the use of the d-pad players can select between whatever items they have in the top, left, right, and bottom squares. This thusly allows players to switch between their weapons in real time.</p><p>There is no longer a mysterious merchant by which players buy and upgrade their weapons. Instead there is a HUB that the player can use to store unwanted weaponry or ammunition and so forth, and can then use their accumulated gold from killing enemies to potentially buy new weapons or upgrade their current ones. Though not all weapons are available for purchase; some are unlocked as the story progresses, while others are made available once other certain weapons have been fully upgraded. Treasures can once again be collected through the game, be they hidden within the environment or dropped by a powerful enemy, which can be sold in the HUB for additional cash. Treasures cannot be combined like in RE4 for an increase in value, however.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637075-res5_inventory.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2637075" data-ratio="0.62588235294118" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637075-res5_inventory.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2637075"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="The Inventory &amp; Cooperative HUB" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637075-res5_inventory.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637075-res5_inventory.jpg" alt="The Inventory &amp; Cooperative HUB"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Inventory &amp; Cooperative HUB</figcaption></figure><p>Players are sent to the HUB whenever they re-enter the story should they have quitted earlier, in-between story chapters, and even when they die. Whatever treasures/weapons/ammunition the player may have collected (or used up, in the case of ammunition) before reaching a hard checkpoint will still persist in the player's inventory when they are sent back to the HUB. Players can also access it via the game's main menu as well.</p><h3>Health &amp; Healing Items</h3><p>A character's health is now again represented as 3/4's of a circle; whence damaged, the health of the circle will deplete and change color the more health is lost. A character's extent of health is static and cannot be upgraded with yellow herbs anymore, though there are items that can be equipped to reduce damage.</p><p>While yellow herbs are no longer available, green and red still persist and can be combined to increase their effectiveness. A list of herbs and their effectiveness is as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Green Herb</strong> - On its own will heal roughly 25% of health.</li><li><strong>Green + Green Herb</strong> - Mixed will now health roughly 50% of health.</li><li><strong>Green + Red Herb</strong> - Mixed will heal the player character fully.</li><li><strong>Red Herb</strong> - On its own will do nothing.</li></ul><p>Besides herbs, first aid sprays are available for use and like always will heal the character fully. Eggs can also be found throughout the game in three varieties:</p><ul><li><strong>White</strong> - Roughly heals about 30% of health</li><li><strong>Brown</strong> - Roughly heals about 40% of health</li><li><strong>Gold</strong> - Heals a character fully.</li></ul><p>While they're ordinarily found like any other item, the player will sometimes encounter chickens. If a player scares it enough, be it by aiming or shooting near one, there's a chance it'll lay an egg the player can collect. Snakes also exist within the world (and often like to hide within destructible crates/barrels) that have a chance of dropping an egg whence killed, too.</p><p>When healing with a herb mixture or first aid spray it's beneficial that the characters are close by as it will heal them both -- eggs, however, will not. Though they do at least have the advantage of being stackable, with up to five of a single variety being able to fit into a single inventory square.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637076-re5_dying.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2637076" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637076-re5_dying.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2637076"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Chris, shown to be in the 'Dying' state." class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637076-re5_dying.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637076-re5_dying.jpg" alt="Chris, shown to be in the 'Dying' state."></noscript></a><figcaption>Chris, shown to be in the 'Dying' state.</figcaption></figure><p>When a character's health gets into the red the player will visually walk with their hand on their hip with a slight decrease in movement speed. Should a character lose all of their health, however, they will go into the Dying state -- represented by the fourth segment of the circle. When in the Dying state players can only slowly limp while what remains of their dying gauge begins to drop; the only way out of it is if the other character can either heal them with a herb/first aid spray, or will otherwise administer a shot of adrenaline to bring them out of it -- a prompt to do so for both actions will appear on the saviour character's screen. The shot will not heal any health, however, and any attack will throw the character back in the Dying state--if not kill them outright--which will continue to drop from whence it was left before the player was pulled out of it.</p><h3>Cooperative Gameplay</h3><p>In-line with the game's bigger emphasis on action, the whole of RE5's story can be played cooperatively for up to two-players. By default player 1 is always Chris Redfield while the second takes control of Sheva Alomar. Though upon completing the game the first player can then choose which character they want to play as. RE5 can be played cooperatively Online, though split-screen and even LAN are available methods also. However there is no drop-in drop-out functionality; whence a new player joins an online game, the game will take both players back to the HUB screen as mentioned before.</p><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637077-resident-evil-5-screenshot-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2637077" data-ratio="0.56276150627615" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637077-resident-evil-5-screenshot-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2637077"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Playable story characters Sheva &amp; Chris" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637077-resident-evil-5-screenshot-2.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637077-resident-evil-5-screenshot-2.jpg" alt="Playable story characters Sheva &amp; Chris"></noscript></a><figcaption>Playable story characters Sheva &amp; Chris</figcaption></figure><p>Both Chris &amp; Sheva play almost the exact same as one another, and have the same capabilities and can use nearly all of the weapons available in the game, however they each have their own single, exclusive weapon that only they can use. The one major difference between how they each play is their perspective; Chris, like the playable characters of RE4 before him, aims over his right shoulder, whereas Sheva aims over her left. This was done to give the game a more pleasing visual aesthetic in split-screen mode.</p><p>There are a number of times throughout the game where the two characters are forced to split-up. This usually involves Sheva, with the help of Chris, leaping over a gap to reach another part of the environment to collect a key item -- while the other may likely be able to provide cover fire. However since the players are split up, they can no longer heal each other nor bring the other back out of the dying state. Though sequences where characters split-up are short-lived.</p><p>Players are able to trade supplies such as ammunition and healing items (thought not weapons) between each other both in-game and in the HUB. There is also a small series of in-game commands players can give each other. These are: Go, Wait, Come On, and Thanks. Go, Wait, and Thanks are triggered by holding (by default) the circle/B button down, and then choosing from the three commands with the d-pad; Come On is triggered by simply pressing the circle/B button. Though Thanks can also be triggered this way in response to assistance from the other character, such as after being gifted/traded an item or after being saved from an enemy grappling the player. Pressing circle/B when the player's partner scores a headshot or manages to successfully enact a follow-up melee attack will also have their character compliment their partner.</p><p>With the map up, both players will be shown. Though if one player gets out of range of the map, the other player can then hold down L2 directing the player's attention to the location of the other player.</p><h3>Secondary Character AI</h3><p>When playing in single-player the secondary character will still persist, but is now controlled by a friendly AI. However it is still just as vulnerable as the player and shares all of the same gameplay mechanics and trappings, including its own 9-square inventory grid. It will often act of its own accord and will fire at whatever enemy it encounters, regardless of how much ammunition it has. It will heal itself when damaged and usually knows which healing item is most suitable, though it will usually rush to the player first to make sure they both get healed -- regardless of whether the player actually requires healing or not. It will also collect supplies on its own, though will at least give some to the player should they feel the player is in need of them, or if it collected ammunition it can't use. Though this may not always be the case.</p><p>Fortunately it will gladly trade items with the player when requested and will even always thank the player for any assistance as well. However because it tends to go through ammo relatively quickly, it's advised that the human player equips themselves with different weapons to the AI. Such as for example sticking the AI with an SMG or Assault Rifle while the player uses a Handgun. As it's an AI, its accuracy is very high, thus it excels with Sniper Rifles in particular. While it will use whatever firearms it has at its disposal, it will not use any explosive weapons such as the RPG Launcher, Grenade Launcher, or even grenades.</p><p>When the player is forced to split-up with the AI it will follow a specific script, be it collecting the necessary key item or unlocking a door, and will then attempt to regroup with the player ASAP. It will at least attempt to defend itself when necessary, though it will not revert to its default patterns until it is reunited with the player.</p><p>Though while it is largely agreed upon by its community that Resident Evil 5 makes for a better experience when playing cooperatively, it's worth noting there is unique dialogue in the single-player version--dialogue that also differs dependant on whether the player is controlling Chris or Sheva--that isn't heard otherwise.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2685869-goodguys.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2685869" data-ratio="0.56666666666667" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2685869-goodguys.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2685869"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Chris, Sheva, and Josh" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2685869-goodguys.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2685869-goodguys.jpg" alt="Chris, Sheva, and Josh"></noscript></a><figcaption>Chris, Sheva, and Josh</figcaption></figure><p>On two occasions the player(s) will be accompanied by BSAA Delta leader, Josh Stone. However he is not playable under any context within the main game and functions as a friendly AI compatriot. Though unlike Sheva, Josh Stone sticks to a script and isn't as dynamic as the player's partner AI. He is often shown trying to work a piece of machinery to help open the way. During the first scenario Josh will defend himself when necessary, equipped with an M9SF pistol, but can also die if he receives enough damage. Though for his second appearance he merely awaits for the players on a boat, and none of the enemies will pay him any heed.</p><p>Josh's melee attacks are a carbon copy of Chris', and it wasn't until the DLC story Desperate Escape that Josh was given his own set of unique attacks.</p><h3>Quick Time Events</h3><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661828-gam210.know.act5_b1_1--article_image.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661828" data-ratio="0.5622009569378" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661828-gam210.know.act5_b1_1--article_image.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2661828"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2661828-gam210.know.act5_b1_1--article_image.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661828-gam210.know.act5_b1_1--article_image.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661828-gam210.know.act5_b1_1--article_image.jpg" alt="2661828-gam210.know.act5_b1_1--article_image.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>QTEs return and are again most commonly encountered should a player be grabbed by an enemy--which'll require the player to wiggle the right analogue--or in the case of bosses to sometimes avoid an attack entirely. They are also encountered during specific cutscenes, where the player must press the on-screen prompts as they appear otherwise they will die. Sometimes players may also have to rapidly tap a single button as well, usually as a means to further illustrate a scene depicting a struggle for example.</p><p>If playing cooperatively, cutscene QTEs are divided between players depending on which character is doing the action on-screen. Though there are still some that require both players to press the prompts simultaneously.</p><h3>Melee Combat</h3><p>Melee attacks return and have been further expanded upon. When fighting the variety of regular Majini enemies, shooting them in the head, leg, or shoulder will stun them for a couple of seconds, allowing players to then perform a powerful melee attack by way of a prompt next to the stunned enemy. Though depending on which part of the Majini is shot will prompt a different attack -- Chris &amp; Sheva each have unique melee attacks as well. Characters are also invulnerable whilst performing a melee attack, making them suitable for both offence and defense.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637078-st-106.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2637078" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637078-st-106.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2637078"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Chris, managing to hit two Majini at once with a Right Hook" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637078-st-106.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637078-st-106.jpg" alt="Chris, managing to hit two Majini at once with a Right Hook"></noscript></a><figcaption>Chris, managing to hit two Majini at once with a Right Hook</figcaption></figure><p>Certain melee attacks can be chained between characters, with for example Chris enacting one following by Sheva committing another, with Chris unleashing a final third. The third attack of the chain is extremely powerful and cannot be triggered any other way beyond being the final attack of a combo. They will most often be used against the larger enemies, as they tend to stagger rather than get knocked to the ground like common Majini enemies. When playing alone with the AI, it will attempt to chain melee attacks with the player when possible, though it will usually rely on firearms more so than melee attacks.</p><p>A list of Chris &amp; Sheva's melee attacks are as follows:</p><h4><strong>Chris:</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Straight Punch</strong> - A straight lung, usually only striking a single enemy but may still knock the enemy far enough to topple over other enemies. Is often comically compared to<a href="/captain-falcon/3005-1215/" data-ref-id="3005-1215"> Captain Falcon</a>'s Falcon Punch attack in <a href="/nintendo/3010-90/" data-ref-id="3010-90">Nintendo</a>'s <a href="/super-smash-bros/3030-19125/" data-ref-id="3030-19125">Super Smash Brothers</a> franchise. Within the context of a regular Majini enemy, it is actionable when it has been shot to the face and is forced to clasp its face.</li><li><strong>Right Hook</strong> - Chris' weakest attack, though it has a good chance of hitting multiple enemies and is useful for potentially starting a combo with Sheva. Within the context of a regular Majini enemy, this attack is actionable when it has been shot in the left or right shoulder.</li><li><strong>Kick - </strong>Another relatively weak attack, this too is primarily useful for leading into another attack by Sheva. Within the context of a regular Majini enemy, this attack is actionable from behind when it has been shot in the left or right shoulder.</li><li><strong>Uppercut - </strong>Roughly about the same power as the Straight Punch, the uppercut has a better chance of hitting multiple enemies. Within the context of a regular Majini enemy, this attack is actionable from the front when it has been shot at the knee and keels over in pain for a few seconds.</li><li><strong>Neck Snap</strong> - Chris' most powerful attack as it will kill a regular Majini instantly. Within the context of a regular Majini enemy, this attack is actionable from the back when it has been shot at the knee and keels over in pain for a few seconds.</li><li><strong>Stomp - </strong>A very powerful attack, and one that may often act as a finisher due to the damage an enemy may have already received to get knocked over. Within the context of a regular Majini enemy, this attack is actionable when it has been knocked to the ground.</li><li><strong>Haymaker</strong> - Besides the Neck Snap, this is easily Chris' most powerful attack. However it can only be performed as the third attack of a combo chain--beginning with Chris--and when directed at an enemy from the front.</li><li><strong>Backhand</strong> - Like the Haymaker, this too deals an equally incredible amount of damage. However it can only be performed as the third attack of a combo chain--beginning with Chris--and when directed at an enemy from the back.</li><li><strong>Top Down Punch</strong> - A relatively weak attack, this is the attack Chris uses against an enemy that is currently grappling the other character. It visually resembles <a href="/ryu/3005-103/" data-ref-id="3005-103">Ryu</a>'s top down punch from the <a href="/street-fighter-alpha/3025-960/" data-ref-id="3025-960">Street Fighter Alpha</a> series.</li></ul><h4><strong>Sheva:</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Roundhouse Kick</strong> - A reliable manoeuvre due to its high likelihood that it'll disperse a crowd, and can at least knock an enemy over. Within the context of a regular Majini enemy, it is actionable when it has been shot to the face and is forced to clasp its face.</li><li><strong>Twist Kick</strong> - Sheva's weakest attack, and is only primarily useful for potentially starting a combo chain with Chris. Within the context of a regular Majini enemy, this attack is actionable when it has been shot in the left or right shoulder.</li><li><strong>Knee</strong> - Another relatively weak attack, this too is primarily useful for leading into another attack by Chris. Within the context of a regular Majini enemy, this attack is actionable from behind when it has been shot in the left or right shoulder.</li><li><strong>Somersault</strong> - Somewhat reminiscent of <a href="/guile/3005-266/" data-ref-id="3005-266">Guile</a> from Street Fighter's Flask Kick move, Sheva's somersault does a high amount of damage, but will often only manage to hit a single enemy. Within the context of a regular Majini enemy, this attack is actionable from the front when it has been shot at the knee and keels over in pain for a few seconds.</li><li><strong>Throat Slice</strong> - Sheva's most powerful attack, as like Chris' Neck Snap will kill a regular Majini instantly. However the animation is noticeably longer overall. Within the context of a regular Majini enemy, this attack is actionable from the back when it has been shot at the knee and keels over in pain for a few seconds.</li><li><strong>Impale</strong> - A very powerful attack, even more so than Chris' stomp, and one that may often act as a finisher due to the damage an enemy may have already received to get knocked over. Within the context of a regular Majini enemy, this attack is actionable when it has been knocked to the ground.</li><li><strong>Skull Crusher - </strong>Besides the Throat Slice, this is easily Sheva's most powerful attack. However it can only be performed as the third attack of a combo chain--beginning with Sheva--and when directed at an enemy from the front.</li><li><strong>Spinning Back Kick</strong> - Like the Skull Crusher, this too deals an equally incredible amount of damage. However it can only be performed as the third attack of a combo chain--beginning with Sheva--and when directed at an enemy from the back.</li><li><strong>Pivot Kick</strong> - A relatively weak attack, this is the attack Sheva uses against an enemy that is currently grappling the other character.</li></ul><h2>Story</h2><h3>Main Characters</h3><h4><a href="/chris-redfield/3005-413/" data-ref-id="3005-413">Chris Redfield</a></h4><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/25/10649-ChrisRedfieldRE5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-10649" data-size="small" data-ratio="2.8264758497317" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:282.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/25/10649-ChrisRedfieldRE5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-10649"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Chris Redfield - Resident Evil 5" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/25/10649-ChrisRedfieldRE5.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/25/10649-ChrisRedfieldRE5.jpg" alt="Chris Redfield - Resident Evil 5"></noscript></a></figure><p>The leading protagonist and returning hero from the original Resident Evil, Chris is now apart of the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance (of which he is a founding member) heading into Africa to investigate a possible arms deal under way lead by Ricardo Irving.</p><p>Now aged at 35, Chris' overall motivations have slipped somewhat and he has begun to question if what he is doing is even making a difference to the world.</p><ul><li>Voiced by <a href="/roger-craig-smith/3040-4136/" data-ref-id="3040-4136">Roger Craig Smith.</a></li><li>Motion captured by <a href="/reuben-langdon/3040-40654/" data-ref-id="3040-40654">Reuben Langdon</a>.</li></ul><h4><a href="/sheva-alomar/3005-1085/" data-ref-id="3005-1085">Sheva Alomar</a></h4><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4432/607207-re5_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-607207" data-size="small" data-ratio="2.1944444444444" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:219.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4432/607207-re5_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-607207"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Sheva" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4432/607207-re5_1.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4432/607207-re5_1.jpg" alt="Sheva"></noscript></a></figure><p>An all new character, Sheva is a native of West Africa, a part of the B.S.A.A. branch stationed there.

Now apart of the B.S.A.A., a non-profit military organisation that exists to combat Bio-Organic threats, Redfield's latest mission takes him to West Africa.</p><p>While he would ordinarily be partnered with long-time friend Jill Valentine, 3 years earlier she was attacked and presumably killed by Albert Wesker. As such, Chris chose to travel to Africa alone. Though when arriving, he is quickly partnered up with Sheva Alomar, a West African native and fellow B.S.A.A. agent.</p><p>The two are to investigate the fishing town of Kijuju, as there is purported to be a B.O.W. arms deal planning to be put underway, lead by Oil businessman Ricardo Irving. It isn't long before the locals are quickly revealed to all have been infected with the Las Plagas -- a parasite first encountered by Leon S. Kennedy in Spain. Upon being forced to fight their way through hordes of infected civilians, the two are able to locate Alpha team of the BSAA, who were planning to apprehend and question Irving. However they are heard in combat via radio and communication is cut off. Chris and Sheva are soon able to locate Alpha team, however it was too late; all of them were killed, with team captain DeChant as the only survivor. He claims they were set-up, but before he can divulge anymore information dies due to his injuries.</p><p>It isn't long before two then encounter what killed Alpha team -- Uroborus, a new type of B.O.W. even Chris hasn't encountered before. Utilising the nearby furnace, they discover it is weak to fire and use it to kill the monster.</p><p>From there they meet up with Josh Stone, captain of the West African branch's Delta team. He provides them with information regarding Irving's whereabouts before going off for backup. Chris &amp; Sheva keep on the tail and are able to corner Irving. However he is rescued by a woman concealed by a bird mask and cloak. The duo are thusly forced to continue the chase.</p><p>Upon meeting up with B.S.A.A. member <a href="/dave-johnson/3005-15420/" data-ref-id="3005-15420">Dave Johnson</a>, they hitch a ride on his humvee. Though upon their arrival at the next checkpoint, they are ambushed by a massive creature called N'desu. It kills Dave, but is then taken down thanks to the weaponry located on the humvee by Chris and Sheva. After travelling through a Tribal Village that has also been infected with the Las Plagas, with the return of Josh they are then able to finally reach Irving once more on his yacht.</p><p>However, Irving injects himself with a Master Plagas sample, rapidly transforming himself into a humongous, amphibious monster. With the use of the gatling and rocket turrets on his boat, the two are able to kill it. Barely hanging on to life, what remains of Irving--who was functioning as the uvula of the creature--upon realising the male agent that killed was Chris Redfield, states the two should head to the nearby cave and look for an ''<a href="/excella-gionne/3005-8921/" data-ref-id="3005-8921">Excella</a>''.</p><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1689389-re5dx9__218_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1689389" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1689389-re5dx9__218_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1689389"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Excella Gionne" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1689389-re5dx9__218_.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1689389-re5dx9__218_.jpg" alt="Excella Gionne"></noscript></a><figcaption>Excella Gionne</figcaption></figure><p>Taking his advice, Josh ferries them to the cave, but then departs once again to try and locate help. Chris &amp; Sheva fight their way through the cave, which is infested with more Las Plagas-infected tribesman. They eventually are introduced to Excella, the CEO of Tricell who are in fact a B.S.A.A. benefactor. Like Irving she continually gives them the slip. Upon their chase, Chris discovers that Jill Valentine may actually be alive; footage of her in a test beacon is found on an Umbrella computer. Chris demands answers from Excella, but she instead unleashes a huge crab-like B.O.W. Though this too is bested by the combined skill of Chris and Sheva.</p><p>Upon reaching Excella within an underground temple, Chris' arch-nemesis Albert Wesker reveals himself, alongside the woman wearing the bird mask. The woman is also then revealed to be Jill Valentine, however she is shown to be a puppet of Wesker and follows his command.</p><p>While Excella leaves the scene, Wesker opts to engage in a two-vs-two fight; Chris &amp; Sheva vs Wesker &amp; Jill. Wesker, however, still retains all of his super-human agility and strength, and cannot be fought by normal means. As such, Sheva attempts to keep Jill occupied--whom while is incredibly aggressive is still only human--while Chris lures Wesker into the side corridors of the temple. From there he uses stealth to catch Wesker off guard, doing whatever damage he can. Eventually, Wesker is forced to draw the fight to a premature close due to other business, but leaves Jill to finish them off.</p><p>Jill soon reveals by opening up her battlesuit that she is being controlled by a strange virus that is continually being pumped into her system. Upon Chris using his voice to remind her of him, he is able to temporarily confuse her enough so as to try and tear the device off. With the help of Sheva, they are finally able to tear the thing off completely. While back to her normal self Jill is still in a weakened state, and urges them to go and stop Wesker without her. But only before she indulges vital information regarding Wesker's own virus; by over-dosing him with a specific serum, that'll then course it to act as a poison. She also reveals Wesker's plan to use jets to unleash Uroborus upon the world. With this information in hand, Chris &amp; Sheva go after Wesker.</p><p>Upon arriving on Wesker's battleship, they encounter Excella. However it turns out that she was betrayed by Wesker and infected with Uroborus so as to slow the two down.

They are intelligent enough to know how to use automatic firearms and utilise cover, work together more efficiently, and will even make sound use of grenades, cattle prods and bulletproof shields. The Soldier Majini suffer one notable drawback, however, in that some will often be found wearing an array of grenades over their chest, introducing an opportunity for players to take advantage and kill the Majini instantly by shooting the grenades.</p><h3>Common Majini Mutations</h3><p>Like the Ganado before them, once Majini have taken enough damage there is often a high chance that they will mutate into something further.</p><h4>Cephalo</h4><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637093-maijini_cephalo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2637093" data-ratio="1.7460317460317" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:174.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637093-maijini_cephalo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2637093"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2637093-maijini_cephalo.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637093-maijini_cephalo.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637093-maijini_cephalo.jpg" alt="2637093-maijini_cephalo.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>The most common mutation, usually brought forth after a successful headshot, Cephalo is a plagas that protrudes out of a Majini's neck, almost resembling a large centipede. The Majini will no longer make use of any weapons they previously used and will instead use the plagas almost like a whip to swipe the player. Because of the many skittering legs that litter the plagas, simply being too close to the mutated Majini can inflict damage without the Majini actually initiating an attack. Damage to the plagas host is now largely ineffective, and the Majini from then on is most vulnerable by shooting the plagas itself.</p><h4>Kipepeo</h4><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637096-re5-kipepeo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2637096" data-ratio="1.0227272727273" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:102.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637096-re5-kipepeo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2637096"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2637096-re5-kipepeo.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637096-re5-kipepeo.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637096-re5-kipepeo.jpg" alt="2637096-re5-kipepeo.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>The second most common mutation, and another that is largely ported from one such Ganado mutation in Resident Evil 4. This one is a form a flying plagas that bursts out of the Majini's back once it has received enough damage. Once airborne and out of its host, its attacks are sporadic and unpredictable, and it can also quickly dart out of the way should the player aim at it. Otherwise it is relatively weak and can be taken down in groups easy with a few accurate shotgun rounds.</p><h4>Duvalia</h4><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637097-duvalia.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2637097" data-ratio="1.4" data-width="250" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 250px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:140.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637097-duvalia.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2637097"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2637097-duvalia.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637097-duvalia.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637097-duvalia.jpg" alt="2637097-duvalia.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>Only encountered against the soldier Majini, the Duvalia, as is custom with mutations, occurs once the Majini has received so much damage. Then the Majini begins to rapidly mutate into what almost looks like an exotic flower.

Reapers are pretty much indestructible lest the player shoots their weak points, which are littered across the back of the Reaper and will sporadically expose themselves only for a second. Should the player manage to shoot one of the weak points, the Reaper keels over revealing two more weak points, finally resulting in the Reaper bending backwards to reveal its most vulnerable region within the middle of its carapace.</p><p>If the player shoots anywhere else besides one of the telegraphed weak points, the Reaper emits a mist which clouds the player's vision of the Reaper.

While they largely look the same, they are noticeably bigger in mass with more muscle. The most notary difference is for their resistance to bullets, allowing them to withstand copious amounts of firearm fire. Unlike the original Lickers, however, Licker β's have one particular weakness: Their exposed heart. Because of this, should the player manage to knock a Licker onto its back, they can then commit and instant kill by way of a button prompt allowing them to stab the Licker directly in its heart. One other weakness they have inherited over their predecessors is their inability to see. Though they have highly acute hearing, it is possible during some occasions for the player to avoid combat with Lickers altogether as long as they walk past without firing their weapons.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234162-licker4__article_image.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234162" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5622009569378" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234162-licker4__article_image.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234162"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2234162-licker4__article_image.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234162-licker4__article_image.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234162-licker4__article_image.jpg" alt="2234162-licker4__article_image.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>Licker β's still attack using the same array of moves, including their tongue which they now use to pierce a character's shoulder continually draining the character's health the longer it stays.

The most suitable tactic for beating the creatures is to shoot the small eye it has located on the back on its large hump.</p><p>Unlike the Executioners, should a Guardian manage to grab the player, they need their partner to save them otherwise the player currently grabbed will die - no QTE's to allow them to escape the Guardian's grasp.</p><h3>Crocodiles</h3><p>While not infected, the native crocodiles of West Africa are much more so aggressive than average crocs. They are only encountered during the marshlands: First whilst the player is riding a raft, as the crocodiles attempt to bite them, and secondly as the player is traversing waist-high water to reach a small settlement of huts. On the raft they can only be avoided via QTE's, but when travelling through the water they can be killed.

Otherwise, if its a cooperative game, one player can always act as bait while the other shoot at its rear.</p><h3>Ndesu</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234174-ndesure5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234174" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.25" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:125.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234174-ndesure5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234174"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2234174-ndesure5.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234174-ndesure5.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234174-ndesure5.jpg" alt="2234174-ndesure5.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>The successor to El Gigante from Resident Evil 4, Ndesu is Tricell's counterpart. Though it looks similar in appearance, it differs in that it has multiple Las Plagas parasites within rather than a single large Plagas like El Gigante. Unlike in Resident Evil 4 where El Gigante's was faced on foot, Ndesu is fought whilst Chris and Sheva are in a B.S.A.A. Humvee using turrets.</p><p>It attacks using similar such tactics as its El Gigante brethren; with its brute strength it attempts to smash and stamp down on the Humvee, while also picking up power posts and even a boulder to throw at the vehicle. The player is tasked with continually shooting at whatever Ndesu equips to quickly cause him to flinch so he'll drop his weapon. Besides Ndesu there are a small squadron of Kijuju Majin that'll attack the player with molotovs or by using their crossbows. They are easily dispatched thanks to the turret's power, however another group will always return after an allotted time until the battle is over.</p><p>After it takes so much damage, the many Las Plagas within erupt out of its skin. Once they've been killed, Ndesu keels over for a much larger parasite to expose itself out of its back giving players the chance to finally shoot at its weak point. After 2-3 assaults on the main Las Plagas parasite, Ndesu is finally killed.</p><h3>Ricardo Irving</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234172-re5_194.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234172" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.664" data-width="480" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:66.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234172-re5_194.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234172"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2234172-re5_194.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2234172-re5_194.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2234172-re5_194.jpg" alt="2234172-re5_194.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>Because of his failure at stopping Chris &amp; Sheva's pursuit, Jill Valentine currently in her 'Bird Lady' outfit hands Irving a vial with a Master Plagas sample, and orders him to use it should he be cornered. As such, once Chris &amp; Sheva manage to finally catch up to Irving on his luxury boat, he gives in to the potential power a Master Plagas would give and injects himself with it.</p><p>It only takes seconds for the parasite to cause Ricardo to mutate; after leaping into the water, Irving soon resurfaces as a monstrously huge amphibious creature. Because this is the work of a Master Plagas, Irving has complete control over his actions. To fight back against the beast, players must use the turrets conveniently located on Irving's boat. Two miniguns and two rocket launchers, players are to shoot at the glowing weak point until it submerges and its tendrils pop out in exchange. Occasionally, it will swim up to attempt to bite the player with its gigantic maw; a button prompt will quickly appear so as the player can avoid the attack. Soon after so much punishment, the creature latches onto the boat as Ricardo, now essentially functioning as the uvula of the monster, reveals himself so as the player can shoot him. After so many attempts, the beast soon spits out Ricardo's body as it dies. Ricardo then soon follows as his sack-like body disintegrates.</p><h3>U-8</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234173-u8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234173" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.56105263157895" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234173-u8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234173"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2234173-u8.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234173-u8.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234173-u8.jpg" alt="2234173-u8.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>The U standing for 'Ultimate', U-8 is a massive crab-like B.O.W. Excella Gionne unleashes to attempt to kill Chris &amp; Sheva. Acting as a blockade stopping the elevator they're currently on from descending any further, the duo have no choice but to fight against the U-8. Because of its size, its mass stretches across nearly half the size of the elevator; its weak points are the patches of fleshy skin along its claw, however should the player get close, U-8 will often attempt to strafe around the elevator.</p><p>Once enough damage has been done, it will eventually collapse onto the elevator with its mouth agape. This then gives the chance for players to unload at the mouth. Alternatively, players can throw a grenade down its throat (which triggers a small cutscene) to do maximum damage. Each grenade hurled in breaks apart of the armor covering U-8's head, allowing more opportunities to do significant damage. U-8 attacks by performing long range slices with its claws, which'll open a button prompt to help players avoid in time. It will also eventually summon a small array of flying insects to pester players and knock them off their aim when they're shooting U-8's weak points.</p><h3>Uroboros Mkono</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234171-mkono.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234171" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.71444444444444" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:71.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234171-mkono.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234171"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2234171-mkono.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234171-mkono.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234171-mkono.jpg" alt="2234171-mkono.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>The second helping of Uroboros comes courtesy of Excella Gionne, who once against attempts to halter Chris &amp; Sheva's advance. Though unlike their first encounter, this one is much stronger and there are no conveniently placed furnaces nearby either. Instead players are given multiple gas canisters to drop, along with a flamethrower. The gas canisters, once dropped, will become melded with Uroboros should it move nearby one allowing the player to better maximise the fiery damage potential inflicted. The flamethrower is first stationed on the wall; it has limited ammo, and once used up must be returned so it can be refuelled.</p><p>Tactics for this encounter work pretty much the exact same as the last one and players must use the various fire-related weaponry at their disposal for Uroboros to reveal its weak points. The flamethrower using during the battle is strictly for this battle alone; once it's finished, the player cannot take it with them.</p><h3>Albert Wesker &amp; Jill Valentine</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234225-resident_evil_5_conceptart_z7b45.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234225" data-size="small" data-ratio="2.5316455696203" data-width="237" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 237px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:253.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234225-resident_evil_5_conceptart_z7b45.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234225"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2234225-resident_evil_5_conceptart_z7b45.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234225-resident_evil_5_conceptart_z7b45.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234225-resident_evil_5_conceptart_z7b45.jpg" alt="2234225-resident_evil_5_conceptart_z7b45.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>After much travel and many B.O.W. creatures killed, Chris &amp; Sheva finally manage to catch up to Excella. However, Albert Wesker soon reveals himself to the duo along with a brainwashed Jill Valentine. Wesker finally decides to settle the score with Chris, and along with Jill, they have a two vs two battle inside an underground temple.</p><p>Despite the circumstances, Jill Valentine is not to be killed and it will result in a game over should that happen. She will have no qualms about attempting to kill the player, however. Albert Wesker of course shares the same philosophy. Ordinarily the player is to try and survive for seven minutes, though the player can also attempt to fight Wesker and should they do enough damage, Wesker will cut the current battle short and leave.</p><p>Albert Wesker because of his increased strength and agility is able to avoid nearly all weaponry fire, and can move about the environment considerably faster than the player. His choice of attack is to quickly charge in and use melee attacks against the player; sometimes he will also swiftly pull out his H&amp;K P8 and shoot two rounds at the player, though the player is given button prompts to avoid the shots. The most reliable strategy to beating Wesker during this stage is to run away; after so long has passed, or if the player heads near the door, Wesker will kick the player through it giving access to the upper floor and its corridors. From there the player can attempt to get some distance between them and Wesker, take cover, and then quickly pop out and shoot him. The same works if one player is able to distract him while another attempts to shoot his back.</p><p>Jill Valentine primarily uses her dual VZ61 submachine guns as she effortlessly scurries throughout the environment. It's advised that one player attempts to keep her busy by throwing a flash grenade or the knife to stun her, then do a context-sensitive melee attack knocking her out temporarily. Despite her fondness for her submachine guns, she will still make use of her acrobatic abilities to attack the player should they get close enough.</p><p>Should the player manage to do enough damage, or if the seven minutes run out, Wesker leaves and the current battle ends. Though if the player manages to beat Wesker by inflicting too much damage, a unique treasure is then dropped within the area.</p><h3>Jill Valentine Part II</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234233-jillbattlesuit.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234233" data-size="small" data-ratio="1" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234233-jillbattlesuit.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234233"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2234233-jillbattlesuit.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234233-jillbattlesuit.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234233-jillbattlesuit.jpg" alt="2234233-jillbattlesuit.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>Once Albert Wesker has left, he then leaves it to the still brainwashed Jill Valentine to finish Chris &amp; Sheva after revealing the device on her chest that is the source of her behaviour. Jill functions much like she did during the previous battle against her and Wesker. She will scurry around almost like a wild animal--she will even hiss on occasion--while using her submachine guns and her athletic melee attacks to kill the player.</p><p>The player is a still not to kill Jill and must now attempt to use Chris' voice to 'awaken' Jill by using the A/X (default 360/PS3 controls) while avoiding her attacks; should the player be playing as Sheva in single-player, pressing A/X will still automatically have Chris call out to Jill. Once Chris manages to temporarily get through to her, the device begins to malfunction giving the players time to try and rip the device off. Though when this happens, the player is given two possible choices on how to respond: The player can either use a melee attack, knocking Jill to the ground, and then attempt to pull off the device that way, or one player (or the AI) can grab a hold of Jill while the other player (or AI) can attempt to rip the device off.</p><p>The first option is more effective and will require less tries, though tearing off the device by using the second option will award the player with a trophy/achievement.</p><h3>Uroboros Aheri</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234170-aheri.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234170" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.69868995633188" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:69.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234170-aheri.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234170"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2234170-aheri.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234170-aheri.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234170-aheri.jpg" alt="2234170-aheri.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>What was once the beautiful Excella Gionne, Albert Wesker's betrayal has forced her to become a monstrously huge Uroboros creature. After absorbing a small mount of corpses, the third encounter with Uroboros quickly grows to the entire size of the ship cruiser. At first Chris &amp; Sheva retreat back into the ship during a small QTE sequence; once they arrive back inside the ship, the players only interaction with Uroboros is by avoiding its many surprise attacks.</p><p>Eventually they reach the back of the ship, and along with a portable Ion Cannon weapon do battle with the monster. First the player is to shoot the exposed bulbs, while avoiding its reactionary attacks via a button prompt, and after they've all been extinguished, the 'brain' of the creature is exposed giving players the opportunity to use the Ion Cannon to shoot at it. All the while, Aheri will continuously spawn small Uroboros monsters; they're relatively weak and should often be left as duty for the other player.</p><h3>Albert Wesker Part II</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234290-123491_728348_wesker_noglasses_la.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234290" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.0933333333333" data-width="300" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 300px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:109.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234290-123491_728348_wesker_noglasses_la.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234290"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2234290-123491_728348_wesker_noglasses_la.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234290-123491_728348_wesker_noglasses_la.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234290-123491_728348_wesker_noglasses_la.jpg" alt="2234290-123491_728348_wesker_noglasses_la.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>Fighting near a runway, Chris &amp; Sheva have finally caught up to Wesker and are planning to inject him with a serum that'll neutralize the virus that enhances his strength and agility. Wesker still uses the same sort of attacks as he did when fighting against him previously, though the tactics for beating him have changed. Now players are to turn off the lights so as to stay hidden from Wesker; using an RPG, they are to then shoot at Wesker, who will often grab a hold of it just before it hits him, then shoot the rocket, and finally attempt to inject the serum.</p><p>It usually takes around 3-4 tries before it's finally successful. Between each attempt, however, the player must find other rockets littered about the environment, and then the other player (or AI) must help reload it. After the first attempt, Wesker will then start throwing missiles at the player, but his usual array of attacks revolving around his enhanced agility are what fill out the most of his tactics.</p><p>A similar fight against Wesker also occurs at the end of the Lost in Nightmares story DLC that takes place during the flashback when Chris &amp; Jill are exploring Ozwell E. Spencer's current residence. Though naturally he doesn't have any missiles to throw. Like the battle against both Wesker &amp; Jill, this battle can either end two ways. Either the hidden timer will end, forcing the cutscene to trigger, or the player will be able to do enough damage that it will end prematurely. If players manage to beat Wesker by way of inflicting enough damage, they are awarded a trophy/achievement.</p><h3>Albert Wesker Part III</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234299-big_boss_of_the_day_resident_evils_albert_wesker_20100216014010447_000.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234299" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.3521126760563" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:135.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234299-big_boss_of_the_day_resident_evils_albert_wesker_20100216014010447_000.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2234299"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2234299-big_boss_of_the_day_resident_evils_albert_wesker_20100216014010447_000.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234299-big_boss_of_the_day_resident_evils_albert_wesker_20100216014010447_000.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234299-big_boss_of_the_day_resident_evils_albert_wesker_20100216014010447_000.jpg" alt="2234299-big_boss_of_the_day_resident_evils_albert_wesker_20100216014010447_000.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>The final battle located within a volcano - Wesker has now allowed a containment of Uroboros to meld with his DNA, only this time Uroboros actually agrees with its host's DNA. As such, Wesker has full control of his enhanced powers and abilities. His appearance is still altered, however, as the majority of his upper-body is enveloped in the traditional black tentacles that Uroboros is made of.</p><p>This fight goes through a small number of stages. First, the player is to run away until Chris &amp; Sheva are inadvertently split up. One player is then forced to keep on running while the other must gain Wesker's attention from afar. Sheva will be running alongside a small pathway while Chris is further below. Reagardless of whom Wesker decides to follow, it's up to the other to safeguard them while either: Sheva is attempting to climb back up after apart of the pathway crumbles beneath her feet, or while Chris is attempting to move a boulder out of his way. Then when both characters are reunited, the player is to lead Wesker up to a small hilltop. From there the ending battle begins.</p><p>Players are intended to shoot Wesker in his heart-like orifice which is initially exposed within his back. After enough shots, it will also become visible from his chest as well. Wesker attacks using his Uroboros arms as whips, while also attempting to grapple players; should a player be grabbed, they'll need the assistance of their partner to escape.</p><p>To beat Wesker, players could simply follow the routine of shooting his heart. However, once Wesker is stunned, player's can instead choose to run forward and initiate a QTE event showing Chris &amp; Sheva stab at his heart from both sides -- eventually resulting in the player winning the battle. Wesker is then ultimately killed when the player shoots him with an RPG launcher via a button prompt during the following cutscene.</p><h2>Unlockables</h2><p>Several <a href="/unlockables/3015-1414/" data-ref-id="3015-1414">unlockables</a> can be achieved in Resident Evil 5, most if not all are gained when finishing the game once, and most of which are achieved by a separate shop system using points gained from performance in the story mode or Mercenaries at the end of the game. Points are then spent for several unlockables listed below.</p><h3>Filters</h3><p>All filters can be unlocked at the end of the game by purchasing them from the "Bonus Features" menu option for the cost of 0 points. Filters add to the visuals of the game in several different ways and can be accessed by the "Special Settings" menu option.

Based around arena combat, the player is to kill as many enemies as they can within the time limit; killing enemies within quick succession will start up a combo meter, which often leads to a substantial amount of points. Beginning with 2:00 minutes, the players can extend their time by locating the many time bonuses hidden throughout the map; any enemies killed via a melee attack will also reward the player with a 5 second bonus. Josh Stone acts as the announcer for both the beginning and ending of a Mercenaries match.</p><p>Leaderboards are available for players to show off their scores, and filters can be set to allow players to see their overall ranking worldwide, or to see how well they've done when compared against their friends.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/917927-mercenaries_010.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-917927" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/917927-mercenaries_010.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-917927"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="One of the time bonuses in the Public Assembly map" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/30/917927-mercenaries_010.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/30/917927-mercenaries_010.jpg" alt="One of the time bonuses in the Public Assembly map"></noscript></a><figcaption>One of the time bonuses in the Public Assembly map</figcaption></figure><p>For each of the different maps, there exist mini-bosses taken from the main game who will appear sporadically. Such examples would be The Executioner for <i>The Public Assembly</i> and <i>Prison</i> maps, to the Chainsaw Wielding Majinis for the <i>Ship Deck</i> map. Killing these foes gains the player a sizeable point bonus, as well a 100% chance to drop some added supplies, be it a first-aid spray or some ammunition. Once a player's health reaches the ''dying'' state, they are to tap the O/B (default PS3/360 controls) quickly so they can regenerate their health back to its minimum.</p><p>Once time has run out, the player is then scored from D to SS (SS requiring above 90K) based upon their performance, which is graded on not only how many overall enemies the player killed, but also how high their combo meter reached.

With another player, they can still make use of the same list of characters and can both even play as the same one should they choose. Because there are now two players, one player cannot tap O/B to regenerate their health should they fall into the ''dying'' state, and will require the other player to heal them. Scores required to reach ranks are also doubled to account for the other player at hand as well.</p><p>Much like during the story, the player can use the O/B button's to call out for their ally, with various ad-libs depending on the situation. Each character has been fitted with their own unique dialogue as well - including Wesker, who will often shout out ''Useless!'' should the other player perish in a 2-player round.</p><h3><b>Characters:</b></h3><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Character</th><th scope="col">Starting Inventory</th><th scope="col">Unlock with an A or higher Rank on:</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Chris Redfield (B.S.A.A.)</strong></td><td><ul><li>M92F Handgun w/ 20 Rounds</li><li>Ithaca M37 Shotgun w/ 20 Rounds</li><li>5 Hand Grenades</li><li>50 Handgun Bullets</li><li>10 Shotgun Shells</li><li>First Aid Spray</li></ul></td><td>Unlocked by default.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Chris Redfield (Safari)</strong></td><td><ul><li>SIG P226 Handgun w/ 16 Rounds</li><li>M3 Shotgun w/ 10 Rounds</li><li>RPG Launcher</li><li>RPG Launcher</li><li>30 Handgun Bullets</li><li>10 Shotgun Shells</li></ul></td><td>Village map.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Chris Redfield (S.T.A.R.S.)</strong></td><td><ul><li>SIG 556 Assault Rifle w/ 65 bullets</li><li>S&amp;W M29 Magnum w/ 12 bullets</li><li>Grenade Launcher w/ 12 Electric Grenades</li><li>150 Machinegun Bullets</li><li>6 Magnum Bullets</li></ul></td><td>Experimental Facility map.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sheva Alomar (B.S.A.A.)</strong></td><td><ul><li>M92F Pistol w/ 40 rounds.</li><li>VZ61 Machinepistol w/ 150 rounds.</li><li>Dragunov Sniper Rifle w/ 13 Rounds</li><li>50 Handgun Bullets</li><li>150 Machinegun Bullets</li><li>First Aid Spray</li></ul></td><td>Unlocked by default.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sheva Alomar (Clubbin')</strong></td><td><ul><li>AK74 Assault Rifle w/ 50 Rounds</li><li>Jail Breaker Shotgun w/ 8 Rounds</li><li>S75 Sniper Rifle w/ 20 Rounds</li><li>100 Machinegun Bullets</li><li>20 Shotgun Shells</li><li>10 Sniper Rifle Bullets</li></ul></td><td>Ancient Ruins map.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sheva Alomar (Tribal)</strong></td><td><ul><li>Bow w/ Infinite Ammo</li><li>Grenade Launcher w/ 6 Ice Rounds</li><li>3 Flame Grenades</li><li>3 Flash Grenades</li><li>First Aid Spray</li></ul></td><td>Missile Area map.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Jill Valentine (B.S.A.A.)</strong></td><td><ul><li>PX4 Handgun w/ 25 Rounds</li><li>H&amp;K MP5 Submachine Gun w/ 150 Rounds</li><li>5 Flash Grenades</li><li>50 Handgun Bullets</li><li>150 Machinegun Bullets</li><li>First Aid Spray</li></ul></td><td>Public Assembly map.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Jill Valentine (Battle Suit)</strong></td><td><ul><li>VZ61 Machinepistol w/ 300 Rounds</li><li>H&amp;K PSG1 Sniper Rifle w/ 9 Rounds</li><li>3 Hand Grenades</li><li>150 Machinegun Bullets</li><li>30 Sniper Rifle Bullets</li><li>Mixed Herb made up of 2 Green</li></ul></td><td>Ship Deck map.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Albert Wesker (Midnight)</strong></td><td><ul><li>H&amp;K P8 Handgun w/ 15 Rounds</li><li>S&amp;W M500 Magnum w/ 6 Rounds</li><li>5 Hand Grenades</li><li>5 Proximity Mines</li><li>50 Handgun Bullets</li><li>5 Magnum Bullets</li></ul></td><td>The Mines map.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Albert Wesker (S.T.A.R.S.)</strong></td><td><ul><li>Samurai Edge Handgun w/ 15 Rounds</li><li>Hydra Shotgun w/ 6 Rounds</li><li>Lightning Hawk Magnum w/ 8 Rounds</li><li>30 Handgun Bullets</li><li>10 Shotgun Shells</li></ul></td><td>Prison map.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3><b>Maps</b></h3><h4><b>Public Assembly</b> - Taken from story Chapter 1-2.</h4><p><strong>Enemies:</strong></p><ul><li>Village Majini</li><li>Instigator Majini</li><li>Executioner Majini (Miniboss)</li></ul><h4><b>The Mines</b> - Taken from story Chapter 2-2.</h4><p><strong>Enemies:</strong></p><ul><li>Village Majini</li><li>Big Man Majini</li><li>Reaper (Miniboss)</li></ul><h4><b>Village</b> - Taken from story Chapter 3-2.</h4><p><strong>Enemies:</strong></p><ul><li>Wetlands Majini</li><li>Bui Kichwa</li><li>Giant Majini (Miniboss)</li></ul><h4><b>Ancient Ruins</b> - Taken from story Chapter 4-1</h4><p><strong>Enemies:</strong></p><ul><li>Wetlands Majini</li><li>Giant Majini (Miniboss)</li></ul><h4><b>Experimental Facility</b> - Taken from story Chapter 5-2</h4><p><strong>Enemies:</strong></p><ul><li>Soldier Majini</li><li>Licker β</li></ul><h4><b>Missile Area</b> - Taken from story Chapter 6-2</h4><p><strong>Enemies:</strong></p><ul><li>Soldier Majini</li><li>Gatling Gun Majini (Miniboss)</li></ul><h4><b>Ship Deck</b> - Taken from story Chapter 6-1</h4><p><strong>Enemies:</strong></p><ul><li>Villager Majini</li><li>Chainsaw Majini (Miniboss)</li></ul><h4><b>Prison -</b> An all new environment built specifically for the Mercenaries mode.</h4><p><strong>Enemies:</strong></p><ul><li>Villager Majini</li><li>Big Man Majini</li><li>Executioner Majini</li></ul><h2><a href="/downloadable-content/3015-329/" data-ref-id="3015-329"><b>Downloadable Content</b></a></h2><h3>Versus</h3><p>The Versus pack was released soon after the game's initial launch. It features two game types: Slayers Mode, which is a "point-based game that challenges players to kill Majinis," while Survivors Mode is the game's take on deathmatch. 1v1 or 2v2 is available for both game types. The games are essentially the classic Mercenaries modes with team-based gameplay. The Slayers game mode lets players earn points for killing Majinis and other creatures.</p><p>The Survivors mode pits players against each other and they earn points for getting kills. While Majinis and other creatures will be present in this mode as well, players do not get points for killing them. <i>Versus</i> is the least popular of the DLC, given that RE5's control scheme does not lend itself well to deathmatch.</p><h3>Lost in Nightmares</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70497/1208606-re5___jill_valentine___chris_redfield_rs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1208606" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.36875" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:136.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70497/1208606-re5___jill_valentine___chris_redfield_rs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1208606"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Chris &amp; Jill" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/7/70497/1208606-re5___jill_valentine___chris_redfield_rs.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/7/70497/1208606-re5___jill_valentine___chris_redfield_rs.jpg" alt="Chris &amp; Jill"></noscript></a><figcaption>Chris &amp; Jill</figcaption></figure><p>The Lost in Nightmares DLC is a 1-2 hour mini-campaign, playable in singleplayer or co-op. While it's generally rather short, the game cannot be saved and must be completed in one go.</p><p>Lost in Nightmares follows Chris &amp; Jill during the BSAA mission glimpsed in flashback amidst the main campaign. Set in 2005, three years before Resident Evil 5's story occurs, Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine are to infiltrate a mansion to locate <a href="/ozwell-e-spencer/3005-10018/" data-ref-id="3005-10018">Ozwell E. Spencer</a>, the founder of the sinister Umbrella Corporation. The mini-campaign is deliberately reminiscent of the original <a href="/resident-evil/3030-5842/" data-ref-id="3030-5842">Resident Evil</a>, with innumerable easter eggs and references. These include:</p><ul><li>Jill Valentine having to play moonlight sonata to open a secret passage within a wall.</li><li>Jill also having to lockpick a door.</li><li>An Itchy Tasty reference.</li><li>Cranks.</li><li>A remix of the original Resident Evil Save Room theme that plays over the results screen.</li><li>The ability to play the first third in the mansion with camera angles in place, should the player examine the entrance three times.</li></ul><p>Lost in Nightmares focuses heavily on puzzles over combat, with only one type of enemy across the story -- a new creature called the Guardian of Insanity, which is similar to the Executioner from Resident Evil 5's campaign. However, multiple Guardians are encountered throughout; most are scripted to show up, however the very firsts appearance is random.</p><p>The player's inventory from the main game cannot be transferred into Lost in Nightmare, and both Chris &amp; Jill will always begin with the same M92F pistols. Other weapons can be acquired within the mansion, although what weapons players will find are randomized. The list of weapons that can be found are but a fraction of what can be attained in the main game, however. A list of potential weapons the player may find is as such:</p><ul><li>M3 Shotgun</li><li>H&amp;K Handgun</li><li>S&amp;W Magnum Revolver</li><li>PSG1 Sniper Rifle</li><li>MP5 SMG</li></ul><p>The mini-campaign ultimately concludes with Jill and Chris fighting the ill-fated boss encounter with Wesker depicted in the flashback, which functions exactly like the default Wesker battle from the core game. Wesker can similarly be beaten by either surviving long enough to trigger the cutscene, or by dealing enough damage to end the fight prematurely.</p><p>BSAA emblems, similar to the ones found in the main game, are hidden throughout the area and can be shot for points.</p><h3>Desperate Escape</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2636878-resident-evil-5-dlc-desperate-escape1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2636878" data-ratio="0.56315789473684" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2636878-resident-evil-5-dlc-desperate-escape1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2636878"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Jill &amp; Josh" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2636878-resident-evil-5-dlc-desperate-escape1.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2636878-resident-evil-5-dlc-desperate-escape1.jpg" alt="Jill &amp; Josh"></noscript></a><figcaption>Jill &amp; Josh</figcaption></figure><p>The Desperate Escape DLC is another 1-2 hour mini-campaign, this time focusing on the actions of Jill Valentine and Josh Stone immediately after the boss fight against a mind-controlled Jill. Jill and Josh must flee the TriCell Facility while Chris and Sheva pursue Wesker. Unlike Lost in Nightmares, Desperate Escape focuses almost entirely on combat, with players constantly being ambushed by Majini of all varieties as they make their way across all new environments. Though what enemies the player will face during a playthrough is randomized.</p><p>Like Lost in Nightmares the player's inventory from the core game cannot be transferred over, and both Jill &amp; Josh begin with a pre-set inventory. Many more weapons and supplies can be procured in the field, though they are once again random. The same listing of weapons that can be found in Lost in Nightmares is the same here, only with the added chance of locating an RPG launcher.</p><p>It ends with a last stand, where Jill and Josh must defend themselves until a rescue helicopter comes to save them. This explains how they got their hands on one in time for the main campaign's finale. Like Versus and Lost in Nightmares, Desperate Escape is playable in singleplayer or co-op, splitscreen or online, and costs $5 on Playstation Network or XBox Live Marketplace.</p><p>BSAA emblems can once again be found and shot to increase the player's overall score.</p><p>The game became available for purchase on February 16, 2010 on the Xbox Live platform Games on Demand for $29.99 USD. All three DLC packs were included in the new Resident Evil 5 Gold Edition.</p><h2>Mercenaries Reunion</h2><p>A remix of Resident Evil 5's original Mercenaries minigame, Reunion is first made available should the player purchase the Lost in Nightmares pack or Desperate Escape pack, and is also packed within the Gold Edition of Resident Evil 5. All of the available characters are packed in as well, however should the player only purchase Lost in Nightmares or Desperate Escape, the roster list is cut in half. Because Reunion is a separate mode from the default Mercenaries mode, each set of characters is exclusive to each mode, disallowing the option for having Barry Burton and Albert Wesker team up in 2-player for example.</p><p>Because the roles of Josh and Jill have been reversed (Josh now being playable while Jill is not), Jill is the announcer for Mercenaries Reunion.</p><h3><b>Characters - Lost in Nightmare Unlocks</b></h3><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Character</th><th scope="col">Starting Inventory</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Barry Burton (S.T.A.R.S.)</strong></td><td><ul><li>Samurai Edge Handgun w/ 30 Rounds</li><li>S&amp;W M29 Magnum w/ 12 Rounds</li><li>Dragunov Sniper Rifle w/ 18 Rounds</li><li>50 Handgun Bullets</li><li>6 Magnum Bullets</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Excella Gionne (TriCell)</strong></td><td><ul><li>M93R Raffica Pistol w/ 30 Rounds</li><li>AK74 Assault Rifle w/ 50 Rounds</li><li>Grenade Launcher w/ 12 Flash Rounds</li><li>50 Handgun Bullets</li><li>150 Machinegun Bullets</li><li>First Aid Spray</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><strong>Characters - Desperate Escape Unlocks</strong></h3><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Character</th><th scope="col">Starting Inventory</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Rebecca Chambers (S.T.A.R.S.)</strong></td><td><ul><li>H&amp;K MP5 Submachine Gun w/ 120 Rounds</li><li>Jail Breaker Shotgun w/ 10 Rounds</li><li>150 Machinegun Bullets</li><li>150 Machinegun Bullets</li><li>30 Shotgun Shells</li><li>30 Shotgun Shells</li><li>First Aid Spray</li><li>First Aid Spray</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Josh Stone (B.S.A.A.)</strong></td><td><ul><li>M92F Handgun w/ 100 Rounds</li><li>M3 Shotgun w/ 7 Rounds</li><li>RPG Launcher</li><li>3 Hand Grenades</li><li>10 Handgun Bullets</li><li>10 Shotgun Shells</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Characters - Costume DLC Unlocks</h3><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Character</th><th scope="col">Starting Inventory</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Chris Redfield (Warrior)</strong></td><td><ul><li>H&amp;K P8 Handgun w/ 25 Rounds</li><li>Hydra Shotgun w/ 10 Rounds</li><li>H&amp;K PSG1 Sniper Rifle w/ 15 Rounds</li><li>30 Handgun Bullets</li><li>15 Shotgun Shells</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Chris Redfield (Heavy Metal)</strong></td><td><ul><li>Gatling Gun w/ Infinite Ammo</li><li>Cattle Prod</li><li>3 Proximity Mines</li><li>3 Hand Grenades</li><li>Melee Vest</li><li>Bulletproof Vest</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sheva Alomar (Fairy Tale)</strong></td><td><ul><li>SIG 556 Assault Rifle w/ 80 Rounds</li><li>Ithaca M37 Shotgun w/ 25 Rounds</li><li>S&amp;W M500 Magnum w/ 6 Rounds</li><li>100 Machinegun Bullets</li><li>10 Shotgun Shells</li><li>6 Magnum Bullets</li><li>5 Golden Eggs</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sheva Alomar (Business Lady)</strong></td><td><ul><li>SIG P226 Handgun w/ 16 Rounds</li><li>Lightning Hawk Magnum w/ 8 Rounds</li><li>5 Proximity Mines</li><li>50 Handgun Bullets</li><li>12 Magnum Bullets</li><li>First Aid Spray</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Maps</h3><p>Reunion features all of the same maps from the original mode.

It was initially developed to be a single-player game like Resident Evil 4 before it and zombies were once again the primary opponents the player would face. Other such revisions include Jill Valentine being Chris' Partner instead of Sheva Alomar. Furthermore, even when planned as a single-player game, Jill would still appear in the game and could in fact permanently die during the story based upon a player choice. Sheva was always planned to star in the game one way or the other, only she was originally depicted as a member of a guerilla group instead of the BSAA.</p><p>Excella Gionne was to initially be featured in the game as a TriCell secretary as opposed to being the head of its West African division. What is now known as her role in RE5 was to be filled in by a male ''CEO type character'', to whom she and Wesker would betray, though only before Wesker would also ultimately betray Excella.</p><p>One notable mechanic that was removed mid-development was that of heat disorientation. Should the player have been wandering around out in the sun for too long, their character would start to become disorientated and would even begin to hallucinate. Players would then have to find some shade to take cover from the beating down sun and recuperate.</p><h3>Racism Controversy</h3><p>After the first full gameplay trailer was released during 2007's E3, many interpreted the trailer depicting a lone white character (Chris Redfield) killing infected colored African Majini as to feature racist overtones. However the next trailer then showcased more common Majini varieties besides those of a dark complexion, including Caucasian and some that even look vaguely Spanish. Sheva Alomar, a West African native, was also confirmed to star as Chris' partner during the very same trailer.</p><p>Resident Evil 5 producer <a href="/masachika-kawata/3040-32929/" data-ref-id="3040-32929">Masachika Kawata</a> stated in response to the criticisms "We can't please everyone. We're in the entertainment business – we're not here to state our political opinion or anything like that. It's unfortunate that some people felt that way." Lead producer <a href="/jun-takeuchi/3040-41365/" data-ref-id="3040-41365">Jun Takeuchi </a>also expressed surprise at the complaints, and refuted any claims that the game was altered in any way as a reaction to the accusations.</p><h3>Demo</h3><p>On Friday, December 5th, 2008 a demo for the game was put on <a href="/xbox-live-marketplace/3045-86/" data-ref-id="3045-86">XBLA</a> for Japan. Included in the demo are two stages, Shanty Town and District, which can be played either on solo, or via offline or online Co-op play, which is a highlighted new feature in Resident Evil 5. With some clever snooping on the Internet, one would have been able to acquire the demo for the 360 version of the game. For those who patiently waited, the 360 demo was released on January 26 via the Xbox Live Marketplace being exclusive to Gold Xbox Live members for a week. It was released on PS3 via the Playstation Store a week later on February 2nd.</p><h2>Trivia</h2><ul><li>Jill coincidentally bears a somewhat close resemblance to <a href="/fiona/3005-2146/" data-ref-id="3005-2146">Fiona</a>, the protagonist of the Capcom game <a href="/haunting-ground/3030-2842/" data-ref-id="3030-2842">Haunting Ground</a>.</li><li>Sheva is the first left-handed playable character in the Resident Evil franchise, and the camera is positioned over her left shoulder to compensate; in addition, her HUD is horizontally flipped from the other characters'.

Running on the <a href="/id-tech-6/3015-8504/" data-ref-id="3015-8504">id Tech 6</a> engine, the game harkens back to the <a href="/twitch-aim/3015-4752/" data-ref-id="3015-4752">fast-paced philosophy</a> of the early Doom installments (skipping the slower <a href="/survival-horror/3015-4801/" data-ref-id="3015-4801">survival-horror</a> mechanics of <a href="/doom-3/3030-14537/" data-ref-id="3030-14537">Doom 3</a>). Along with a single-player campaign, the game features standard <a href="/weapon-slot-loadout/3015-2629/" data-ref-id="3015-2629">loadout</a>-based multiplayer (co-developed by <a href="/certain-affinity/3010-6279/" data-ref-id="3010-6279">Certain Affinity</a>) and a detailed <a href="/in-game-map-editor/3015-269/" data-ref-id="3015-269">level creation</a> system (co-developed by <a href="/escalation-studios/3010-6702/" data-ref-id="3010-6702">Escalation</a>) known as "SnapMap".</p><p>Set on a <a href="/union-aerospace-corporation/3015-5646/" data-ref-id="3015-5646">Union Aerospace Corporation</a> (UAC) research facility on <a href="/mars/3035-4/" data-ref-id="3035-4">Mars</a> overrun by <a href="/demon/3015-557/" data-ref-id="3015-557">the forces</a> of <a href="/hell/3035-24/" data-ref-id="3035-24">Hell</a>, the campaign puts the player in the role of the mysterious <a href="/silent-protagonist/3015-54/" data-ref-id="3015-54">silent protagonist</a> known as the <a href="/doomguy/3005-842/" data-ref-id="3005-842">Doom Slayer</a>, as he must fight his way through the facility (and through Hell itself) to close the portals while upgrading both his Praetor suit and his extensive array of weaponry.</p><p>A small chunk of the multiplayer portion of the game received two periods of beta testing: a closed beta (for those who pre-ordered <a href="/wolfenstein-the-new-order/3030-42581/" data-ref-id="3030-42581">Wolfenstein: The New Order</a>) in early April of 2016 and an open beta in mid-April of 2016.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>At the Quake Con 2014 unveil it was revealed that the game focuses on high speed movement and run &amp; gun gameplay like the original Doom, and also features a deep combat melee system, including execution animations. There is no regen health system, thus the player will be forced to pick up health from fallen enemies in order to regain health. This gore kill system, initiated by dealing damage to enemies and then performing a melee attack is meant to keep the action moving forward. The player is encouraged to play aggressively in order to re-supply and regain health.</p><p>Much like classic games of the 90s players will be able to hold all their weapons simultaneously, instead of the typical 2 primaries and a sidearm variant found in most modern shooters of today. Most major weapons have mods that can be attached by finding a modding droid within the level that add additional attacks such as the double tap for the super shotgun. One of the bigger changes is that both the chainsaw and BFG are assigned to their own unique keys and use unique ammo, making them go-to weapons for tougher foes or overwhelming odds.</p><p>Exploration will once again play a key role in Doom with secrets making a big return to the series. Each level will have various secret areas strewn throughout that reward the players with a variety of bonuses. These can range from getting weapons early, collecting armor upgrades that grant passive abilities, or discovering runes that allow the player to take part in instanced challenge rooms that unlock further gameplay abilities. The number of secrets available on each level can always be checked using the map, encouraging players to always go back and look around before moving on with the story.</p><p>id Software has stated that the campaign will be longer than 13 hours and feature an extreme difficulty mode called Ultra-Nightmare. During a play through in Ultra-Nightmare, a death is permanent causing the player to completely start their campaign over from the beginning of the game.</p><h2>Multiplayer</h2><p>Certain Affinity co-developed the multiplayer which includes several classic modes such as deathmatch, team deathmatch, as well as freeze tag, domination, and warpath. Along with traditional gameplay modes, players can expect to locate power-ups, health packs, and jump pads in arenas that were familiar in older id Software games such as Quake. Players can also locate a pentagram that transforms them into a giant demon.</p><p>Doom will launch with 9 multiplayer maps, but including is an in-game tool called "Doom SnapMap". SnapMap will allow players to create new multiplayer maps and new game modes, which are all able to be shared to the online community.</p><p>Strong criticisms were cast during the multiplayer beta test due to the similarities to Halo's multiplayer from armor design to 2-weapon layouts instead of sticking with the more traditional arena modes found in previous games.</p><h2>Development</h2><p>At QuakeCon 2008, id announced that Doom 4 will not be available through <a href="/digital-distribution/3015-2329/" data-ref-id="3015-2329">digital distribution</a> like many of the company's previous titles. At the press conference, id Software co-founder <a href="/john-carmack/3040-4576/" data-ref-id="3040-4576">John Carmack</a> announced that Doom 4 would have "three times as much horsepower as <a href="/rage/3030-20672/" data-ref-id="3030-20672">RAGE</a>". The game was then said to run at only 30 frames a second, but despite this, Carmack promises to raise the bar on video game graphics to a level "no one has ever seen before." Later in the event, id CEO <a href="/todd-hollenshead/3040-14696/" data-ref-id="3040-14696">Todd Hollenshead</a> contradicted Carmack in a way when he announced id is "not even sure if Doom 4 will be Doom 4."</p><p>At Quake-con 2014 a private showing of the game wowed doom fans, but no footage surfaced for the public's viewing pleasure. In a interview it was stated nothing would be shown until 2015.</p><p>In interviews John Carmack has implied that the gameplay was to be more action-oriented than the previous title, and looks to shy away from the survival horror elements of <a href="/doom-3/3030-14537/" data-ref-id="3030-14537">Doom 3</a>. Namely the excessive darkness, monsters 'hiding in <a href="/monster-closet/3015-1205/" data-ref-id="3015-1205">closets</a>', and the relatively limited amount of ammo available.</p><p>Early interviews suggest this move away from survival horror to Doom's more traditional focus on action:</p><blockquote><p>You get to punctuate a lot more with triumphs and successes, and you just don't get to do that very much in survival horror. You know, you want to say, 'I'm victorious,' not, 'I'm not dead.' It's just a fundamentally more rewarding genre to be in.</p></blockquote><h2>Movie</h2><p>Personnel within id software have expressed interest in making a new Doom movie that actually follows the <a href="/doom/3030-7326/" data-ref-id="3030-7326">Doom</a> storyline, unlike the original <a href="/tang-doom/2300-457/" data-ref-id="2300-457">Doom movie</a> starring <a href="/the-rock/3005-1674/" data-ref-id="3005-1674">The Rock</a>. Todd Hollenshead has openly aired his interest in a possible Doom movie following the storyline of Doom 4 itself, whatever that may be. He hopes that the hype for Doom 4 will encourage Universal Studios into talks about the project's possibility.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p>Originally released in 1987 in arcades, Double Dragon is an early brawler game credited, in part, for the popularity of the beat-em-up genre during the 1980s and 1990s. The game was first developed by <a href="/technos-japan-corp/3010-452/" data-ref-id="3010-452">Technos Japan Corporation</a> and published by <a href="/taito-corporation/3010-135/" data-ref-id="3010-135">Taito Corporation</a>, and has since been ported to numerous consoles, computers, handhelds, and even cellular phones. The game also spawned the popular <a href="/double-dragon/3025-158/" data-ref-id="3025-158">Double Dragon</a> franchise, which has had five games in the main franchise, as well as two <a href="/neo-geo/3045-25/" data-ref-id="3045-25">Neo-Geo</a> fighting games.</p><p>After the initial arcade release, the game has been ported to a variety of systems, including the <a href="/nes/3045-21/" data-ref-id="3045-21">Nintendo Entertainment System</a>, <a href="/sega-master-system/3045-8/" data-ref-id="3045-8">Sega Master System</a>, <a href="/zx-spectrum/3045-16/" data-ref-id="3045-16">ZX Spectrum</a>, <a href="/amstrad-cpc/3045-11/" data-ref-id="3045-11">Amstrad CPC</a>, <a href="/commodore-64/3045-14/" data-ref-id="3045-14">Commodore 64</a> (two different versions), <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC</a>, <a href="/atari-st/3045-13/" data-ref-id="3045-13">Atari ST</a>, <a href="/amiga/3045-1/" data-ref-id="3045-1">Amiga</a>, <a href="/atari-2600/3045-40/" data-ref-id="3045-40">Atari 2600</a>, <a href="/atari-7800/3045-70/" data-ref-id="3045-70">Atari 7800</a>, <a href="/game-boy/3045-3/" data-ref-id="3045-3">Game Boy</a>, <a href="/genesis/3045-6/" data-ref-id="3045-6">Sega Genesis</a>, <a href="/lynx/3045-7/" data-ref-id="3045-7">Atari Lynx</a>, <a href="/xbox-live-marketplace/3045-86/" data-ref-id="3045-86">Xbox Live Arcade</a>, <a href="/zeebo/3045-122/" data-ref-id="3045-122">Zeebo</a>, <a href="/iphone/3045-96/" data-ref-id="3045-96">iPhone</a> and <a href="/android/3045-123/" data-ref-id="3045-123">Android</a>. Every release differs in some aspect or another, particularly the <a href="/game-gear/3045-5/" data-ref-id="3045-5">Game Gear</a>, NES, Game Boy, and Atari 2600 versions.</p><p>The game's popularity led to several sequels (with the latest iteration released in 2003), a cartoon series (which ran for two seasons), a comic book (published by Marvel, ran for six issues), and even a movie (which was released in 1994, inspired by the television cartoon). The cartoon and its resulting movie release were both loosely based on the NES version of the game, whereas Jimmy Lee is initially a villain (having been raised by the antagonist of the franchise, the <a href="/shadow-master/3005-14811/" data-ref-id="3005-14811">Shadow Master</a>).</p><p>The game's soundtrack was composed by <a href="/kazunaka-yamane/3040-23791/" data-ref-id="3040-23791">Kazunaka Yamane</a>, and was released in an album on February 21, 1988. The soundtrack, titled Original Sound of Double Dragon, features all nine tracks from the arcade version of the game. These tracks are all arranged versions of the songs found in the game.</p><h3>Gameplay</h3><p>Double Dragon follows <a href="/billy-lee/3005-2644/" data-ref-id="3005-2644">Billy Lee</a> and <a href="/jimmy-lee/3005-2550/" data-ref-id="3005-2550">Jimmy Lee</a> (incorrectly named Hammer and Spike in the promotional materials with the American version of the arcade game), two martial artists whose love interest, Marian, is kidnapped by a gang called the Black Warriors. Playing in cooperative mode triggers a different ending, where Billy and Jimmy must fight each other for the affection of Marian.</p><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/139866/2708118-032204.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2708118" data-ratio="0.74707602339181" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:74.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/139866/2708118-032204.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2708118"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/139866/2708118-032204.jpg" alt="The Black Warriors kidnapping Marian in the Arcade version"></a><figcaption>The Black Warriors kidnapping Marian in the Arcade version</figcaption></figure><p>A three button beat-em-up, there are three base moves in Double Dragon; punching, kicking, and jumping. Various combinations of these moves produce other moves, such as head butts, elbow smashes, jumping kicks, backwards kicks, or the signature Double Dragon hair grab (in which the character grabs the enemy by the hair, making them vulnerable to attacks and throws).</p><p>In addition to moves, Double Dragon has a variety of weapons that can be carried from fight to fight (this was altered in the NES version, where weapons could only be used if the enemy it was taken from is still alive). There are four weapons; baseball bats, whips (neither of which are incredibly effective), knives (which are arguably the most powerful weapons in the game), and explosives (timed explosives which can be thrown).</p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h3>NES Version</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15051/388784-dd2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-388784" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.66666666666667" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:66.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15051/388784-dd2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-388784"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15051/388784-dd2.jpg" alt="Only two enemies can be on-screen simultaneously in NES version"></a><figcaption>Only two enemies can be on-screen simultaneously in NES version</figcaption></figure><p>Released in 1988 (and later on the <a href="../../wii-shop/60-87/" rel="nofollow">Wii Virtual Console</a> in 2008), the NES version of Double Dragon was among the better received ports of the game. Published by <a href="../../tradewest-inc/65-173/" rel="nofollow">Tradewest</a>, Double Dragon on the NES has many differences from the arcade game on which it is based, beyond the obvious decrease in graphical and sound quality. The plot was altered, due to the exclusion of a two-player cooperative mode. Rather than fighting the leader of the Shadow Warriors, <a href="../../billy-lee/94-2644/" rel="nofollow">Billy Lee</a> faces off against his brother, <a href="../../jimmy-lee/94-2550/" rel="nofollow">Jimmy Lee</a>.</p><p>Other than the single player story, there are a few other modes that implement two player gameplay. Mode A allows players to do a tag-team style game, alternating who is playing after each death. Mode B is a one-on-one tournament fighting game, where players can choose to fight either computer controlled opponents or player controlled characters.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5312/503003-doubledragon_44.png" data-ref-id="1300-503003" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.875" data-width="256" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 256px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:87.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5312/503003-doubledragon_44.png" data-ref-id="1300-503003"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="The two player fighting mode in NES version" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5312/503003-doubledragon_44.png"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5312/503003-doubledragon_44.png" alt="The two player fighting mode in NES version"></noscript></a><figcaption>The two player fighting mode in NES version</figcaption></figure><p>The game also implemented an upgrade system, where players earn hearts for dispatching certain amounts of enemies. These hearts upgrade the character's abilities, allowing for more complicated moves such as backwards elbowing and face punching. In addition to moves, there are a variety of weapons available, ranging from baseball bats to whips (as well as ranging in damage dealt, and subsequently usefulness).</p><p>There are many other differences found in the NES version, some due to general technical limitations. For example, only two enemies can be onscreen simultaneously due to the NES's abilities. Naturally, the stage design deviates from what was found in the original arcade version, including new areas, expanded sections, and completely new levels.</p><h3>Master System Version</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17744/594771-doubledcombat.gif" data-ref-id="1300-594771" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="256" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 256px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17744/594771-doubledcombat.gif" data-ref-id="1300-594771"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Sega Master System home console port of Double Dragon" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/17744/594771-doubledcombat.gif"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/17744/594771-doubledcombat.gif" alt="Sega Master System home console port of Double Dragon"></noscript></a><figcaption>Sega Master System home console port of Double Dragon</figcaption></figure><p>After the NES version was released, <a href="/sega/3010-62/" data-ref-id="3010-62">Sega</a> brought the game to their 8-bit platform as well. Due to the <a href="/sega-master-system/3045-8/" data-ref-id="3045-8">Sega Master System</a>'s more powerful hardware, the Master System version has better graphics (with more colors), more enemies on-screen, and modes and levels that are very similar to the arcade version.</p><p>Unlike the NES version of Double Dragon, the Sega Master System version retains the two-player cooperative mode found in the original arcade version. Although it doesn't include the head-to-head versus mode found in the NES game, Double Dragon on the Sega Master System does have one other feature not found in the NES or arcade versions; an unlimited amount of continues (except for the final level).</p><h3>Mega Drive/Genesis Version</h3><p>In 1992, Double Dragon was ported to the <a href="/genesis/3045-6/" data-ref-id="3045-6">Sega Mega Drive/Genesis</a>. This game was developed by Ballistic, and is very similar to the arcade release. Double Dragon on the Sega Genesis was criticized for one key aspect; its control. The game, according to fans and critics, makes it incredibly difficult to hit enemies, with small hit boxes and sloppy movement.</p><h3>Handheld Versions</h3><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6150/504872-ddgg5.gif" data-ref-id="1300-504872" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.9" data-width="160" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 160px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:90.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6150/504872-ddgg5.gif" data-ref-id="1300-504872"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="The Game Gear version only features Billy Lee as a playable character" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6150/504872-ddgg5.gif"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6150/504872-ddgg5.gif" alt="The Game Gear version only features Billy Lee as a playable character"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Game Gear version only features Billy Lee as a playable character</figcaption></figure><p>The game has had three different handheld ports; Game Boy, Sega Game Gear, and Atari Lynx. The first of these three versions was released in 1990. The Game Boy version of Double Dragon is heavily influenced by the NES game, with similar level design, enemies, and overall graphical style.</p><p>The Game Boy version varies on one key aspect from the NES Double Dragon; it does not include the heart system found in this game. Every move is accessible from the start. In some areas, portions of stages were removed completely for the Game Boy port, particularly some platforming segments of the final stage. Additionally, every character in the two player fighting mode was removed except for Billy Lee and Jimmy Lee.</p><p>On the Game Gear, Double Dragon was significantly different from other versions of the game. Subtitled "The Revenge of Billy Lee" in Europe, this game centers around the murder of Jimmy Lee, and Billy Lee's quest of vengeance against the Dragon Clan. Other than this, the game was largely a different game, with altered stage design, different weapons (i.e. guns), and the lack of any modes beyond a single player story mode.</p><p>With large sprites, the Atari Lynx version is another recreation of the original arcade game. Giving only a small view of the stage, the game was criticized due to the fact that enemy and character sprites take up nearly three fourths of the Lynx's screen size. The Atari Lynx version also includes a practice mode, which allows players to fight a varying amount of enemies to learn the controls and moves of the game.</p><p>In 2003 the game received an enhanced remake for the Game Boy Advance in the form of <a href="/double-dragon-advance/3030-20754/" data-ref-id="3030-20754">Double Dragon Advance</a>, which added several new features including cutscenes, additional levels, and new moves.</p><h3>Smartphone Version</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/71263/2252732-doubledragoniphone.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2252732" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.66666666666667" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:66.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/71263/2252732-doubledragoniphone.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2252732"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Smartphone version" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/7/71263/2252732-doubledragoniphone.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/7/71263/2252732-doubledragoniphone.jpg" alt="Smartphone version"></noscript></a><figcaption>Smartphone version</figcaption></figure><p>In 2011 a smartphone version of Double Dragon was released on both iPhone and Android. Rather than a straight port, this version adds several features, some of which originated in the Game Boy Advance remake. In addition to the Lee brothers, players can unlock 24 playable characters for use in any mode.</p><h3>Other Versions</h3><p>Like the sequels to Double Dragon, <a href="/binary-design-ltd/3010-496/" data-ref-id="3010-496">Binary Designs</a> worked on computer ports to create a variety of versions of the game. Additionally, a second Commodore 64 port was created by <a href="/ocean-software-ltd/3010-6983/" data-ref-id="3010-6983">Ocean Software</a>, and differed in many ways from the previous Commodore 64 port. While all of the games naturally differ from the arcade game on which they are based, there are several relevant details relating to the ports.</p><p>The ZX Spectrum version was incredibly different when it came to graphical style. Due to an attempt at the detail of the arcade version, this version had character and enemy sprites which were transparent other than the black outlines. This, combined with an attempt at some detailed color, caused the game to run very slowly.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1339851-dd26_4.gif" data-ref-id="1300-1339851" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="304" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 304px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1339851-dd26_4.gif" data-ref-id="1300-1339851"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Both of the Atari versions of the game were created by Activision" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1339851-dd26_4.gif"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1339851-dd26_4.gif" alt="Both of the Atari versions of the game were created by Activision"></noscript></a><figcaption>Both of the Atari versions of the game were created by Activision</figcaption></figure><p>Both of the Commodore 64 ports were very close in style, attempting to emulate the gameplay of the arcade release (the first even included a two player mode, almost unheard of among the computer ports). A major difference for the first version was a complete lack of sound, other than the sound effects created by punching and kicking. The second version lacked a two player mode, although it is considered by Double Dragon fans to be a slightly better port.</p><p>Also released for the Atari 2600 and Atari 7800, these two ports were handled by <a href="/activision/3010-78/" data-ref-id="3010-78">Activision</a>. The 2600 version of the game naturally cut much of the game's content; with redone sound and graphics to fit the platform's capabilities, removed enemy sprites, cut weapons, and a shorter story mode (although there is still a two player cooperative mode, as well as a two player versus mode). The 7800 version was improved graphically and sound-wise, although it removes the versus mode.</p><h3>Soundtrack</h3><ol><li>Opening (Double Dragon)</li><li>The City Slums (The Black Warriors Arrive)</li><li>The Industrial Area (The Great Fray)</li><li>After the Battle</li><li>Setting Off (A New Battle)</li><li>The Woods</li><li>The Giant Abobo Appears</li><li>The Hideout (Willy the Nemesis)</li><li>Ending (Reunion With Marian)</li></ol><h2>Trivia</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1363166-baddudes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1363166" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.3305489260143" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:133.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1363166-baddudes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1363166"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Data East's Bad Dudes advertisement." class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1363166-baddudes.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1363166-baddudes.jpg" alt="Data East's Bad Dudes advertisement."></noscript></a><figcaption>Data East's Bad Dudes advertisement.</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Two Amstrad CPC ports of Double Dragon were created.

Two major powers exist in this alternate world: the Atlantic Federation in the West controls most of the Europan peninsula, and the East Europan Alliance, known simply as 'the Empire", controls the East. Sitting in between both of these superpowers is the small nation of <a href="/gallia/3035-3295/" data-ref-id="3035-3295">Gallia</a>, home to an ancient bloodline, simple people, and a major reserve of ragnite ore. Ragnite is a miraculous ore that is used for many things, from powering vehicle and tank engines to providing Ragnaid's restorative powers. As the news of dwindling ragnite sources becomes a concern, the Empire launches a full invasion of the Atlantic Federation with a focus on Gallia itself, ostensibly to secure its ragnite. With Gallia struggling against this blitzkrieg, the story focuses on the actions of Squad 7, under command of Lieutenant Welkin Gunther, son of a famous war hero and a would-be natural sciences teacher, and Sergeant Alicia Melchiott, a would-be baker. Both first met each other within the village of Bruhl and found themselves fighting beside each other on the day the Empire's forces ruthlessly attack the city.</p><p>Through several daring missions, Gallia's forces manage to drive the Empire back, forcing its army to regroup. It is also discovered that the motivation behind the Empire's attack is not because of ragnite but because of interest in an all-powerful weapon left behind by an ancient race called the Valkyrur, which he believes to be hidden within the walls of Gallia's capital. According to legend, the Valkyrur had come down from the north and had used their incredible powers to defeat the Darcsen people who are blamed for nearly destroying the continent centuries earlier in a terrible war. Many doubt the existence of the Valkyrur today and consider them only as legend, but it is soon revealed that one of the Empire's generals, Selvaria Bles, is of Valkyrian blood. Displaying supernatural powers on the battlefield such as deflecting a tank shell with her shield or destroying an entire regiment of tanks on her own, she quickly turns the early victory of the Gallian army into a near rout singlehandedly until it is revealed that Alicia Melchiott is also of Valkyrian blood.</p><p>After defeating Selvaria, Alicia has severe doubts about her new role. Prince Maximilian, the commander of the Empire's invasion of the West, tells Selvaria that she must use the Final Flame. Selvaria's devotion to the Prince, born out of his mercy to her when he had her taken away from the Imperial testing facility where they were using her as a guinea pig, is challenged when he asks her to make the ultimate sacrifice. Devoted to both her duty and her unrequited love for her Prince, she makes preparations for the end.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2488/219384-vc1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-219384" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2488/219384-vc1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-219384"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Alicia Melchiott" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2488/219384-vc1.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2488/219384-vc1.jpg" alt="Alicia Melchiott"></noscript></a><figcaption>Alicia Melchiott</figcaption></figure><p>At the fortress of Ghirlandaio on the border of Gallia and the Empire, Squad 7 and the Atlantic Federation engage Imperial forces in a decisive battle to end the war. Selvaria returns and challenges Squad 7 and Alicia to a duel between her forces and theirs without the use of her powers. In this final confrontation, Selvaria is finally defeated but gives herself up honorably. She is treated well by Squad 7 when she is captured. Alicia asks Selvaria how she deals with being a Valkyrur to which Selvaria replies that she must find something to believe in. When the Gallian army's commander arrives and Selvaria speaks without turn, he has a soldier smash the back of her head with the butt of a rifle. Gasping in pain, she asks only one thing: that Squad 7 escort her men, the Imperial prisoners, back to Gallia. The general laughs and accedes her request.</p><p>Later, as the Gallian general gloats in what had been Prince Maximilian's war room as he sits on his throne, Selvaria asks how long it has been since Squad 7 had left. The general says that several hours had already passed. Selvaria smiles to herself and begins burning with a blue light, awakening the Valkyrur power within her as she breaks her chains. The general orders her shot and bullets tear into her, but Selvaria's devotion to the Prince and to her duty give her the strength to demonstrate her will to fulfill her role. With one final speech, she invokes the Final Flame, annihilating the fortress and most of the Gallian army that had occupied it. Squad 7 witness the destruction from miles away as bolts of power sear the landscape, leaving the same type of scars seen in the Barious Desert. Alicia is shaken by Selvaria's sacrifice and questions herself if that is what it means to be a Valkyrur.</p><p>Prince Maximilian suddenly launches an attack with a mobile fortress which is the equivalent of a land battleship. With nothing to stand against it and most of the Gallian army destroyed by Selvaria's sacrifice, Alicia is determined to sacrifice her own life in order to use her new found power to destroy it. After chasing her down, Welkin is able to convince Alicia that there is more of a reason to live and that her powers don't make her any different as he confesses his love for her. Realizing that her new family in Squad 7, along with Welkin's love, represent the only power that should matter, she relents her attack with this new found purpose.</p><p>After this revelation, the members of Squad 7 race back to the capital in an effort to stop the Prince.

With the weapon's destruction, the Prince confronts Squad 7 in a final battle. Fueled by super science and bearing mock Valkyrur weaponry, the Prince attempts to destroy the Squad but after a pitched battle, defeat him at last. In a climactic finish, Welkin and Alicia are rescued from the exploding battleship by a glider that Isara had built. The fate of each squad member is revealed as the credits roll along with a list of those that had survived and those that may have died. Afterwards, it is shown that Alicia and Welkin are now husband and wife and have a daughter, Isara, as life returns to normal.</p><p>Aside from the main story, the game is also notable for dealing with many mature subjects, which have parallels with the Second World War. Genocide, prejudice, and racism against the Darcsen people, recognizable in the game by their dark hair, is depicted among both Gallian and Imperial peoples. For example; within Squad 7, Rosie openly shows her hate towards Darcsens, in particular Isara, the team's tank pilot and Welkin's adopted half-sister.</p><h2>Battle System</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15434/768510-vcdlc_09.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-768510" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15434/768510-vcdlc_09.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-768510"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="How aiming looks." class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15434/768510-vcdlc_09.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15434/768510-vcdlc_09.jpg" alt="How aiming looks."></noscript></a><figcaption>How aiming looks.</figcaption></figure><p>Called "BLiTZ", for "Battle of Live Tactical Zones", Valkyria Chronicles combines real-time and turn-based tactical combat. Each side takes its action in separate phases. Individual units can be activated by using "Command Points" (CP), and different unit classes cost different amounts of command points to activate, with Infantry using up one point and tanks using up two. Once activated, the unit can freely move about the battlefield in real-time, using weapons and abilities. As the unit moves, it can come under suppressing fire from enemy positions. Damage on enemies can also be increased by targeting the head, using mortars and grenades to destroy their cover, or using appropriate counter-units.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/495/628803-valk.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-628803" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/495/628803-valk.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-628803"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Planning the next move." class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/495/628803-valk.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/495/628803-valk.jpg" alt="Planning the next move."></noscript></a><figcaption>Planning the next move.</figcaption></figure><p>Units also have special abilities and traits called "Potentials" that affect their battlefield performance. For example, a unit with the "Child of Nature" potential feels uncomfortable operating on paved roads, lowering their accuracy, while a "Maternal" unit feels the need to protect her family, making her more effective when near units she has a close relationship with. Units also have relationships with other units, which can affect combination attacks, potential activation, and other factors. Commanders can also issue special orders, which can be specialized attacks or temporary boosts to unit attributes or performance.</p><p>Some unit classes are more effective against other unit types.</p><h3>The Classes</h3><h3 style="margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;">Scouts</h3><p>Scouts are the most agile soldier class in the game and their superior eyesight also lets them spot enemies hidden in tall grass from afar. Equipped with a standard caliber rifle, they lack the means to face enemy combat forces head on, but their high stamina can make the scout a valid flanking option. As a secondary weapon, the scout is equipped with a grenade and upgrading him or her to elite status will unlock a grenade launcher attachment.</p><h3 style="margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;">Shocktroopers</h3><p>The standard soldier unit armed with a high-power machine gun, ideal for taking on any type of foot soldiers from up close. They are good all-around units with no obvious weaknesses, but lack any specialties and are less mobile than the scout class. Shocktroopers also carry a grenade. Upon reaching elite status, they gain a flamethrower ideally used in close quarters, capable of hitting multiple enemies in close proximity with one action or bypassing cover to hit a defending enemy.</p><h3 style="margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;">Lancers</h3><p>This class is designed to damage tanks and armored vehicles with their large rocket-tipped lances, and also have enough defense to withstand the heavy blast attacks from mortars and tank rounds. Their low mobility and limited ammo renders them vulnerable to infantry attacks.</p><h3 style="margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;">Engineers</h3><p>Impractical in front line combat, as they have low offensive and defensive capabilities, Engineers are best suited to the support role. The ability to restore ammo, remove land mines, fix sandbags and sniper towers, repair tanks and on top of that having a respectable mobility fills that role well.</p><h3 style="margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;">Snipers</h3><p>Equipped with long-range rifles, snipers can easily take down enemy soldiers from a considerable distance. But low defensive capability and limited mobility weakens this class when facing multiple foes.</p><h3 style="margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;">Tanks</h3><p>These are equipped with highly destructive firepower, and they boast armor that shrugs off attacks from normal infantry - only lancers, other tanks, and special anti-tank cannons can damage them in head-on combat. To prevent overheating, however, tanks have an unarmored radiator in their rear, which is vulnerable to attacks of all kinds. These vehicles can also run over obstacles, such as sandbags or trees. The Tanks have two sections, the body and the tread. If the body is severely damaged the tank will be destroyed, while if the tread is destroyed the tank will survive but will suffer from a decrease in its mobility. Tanks are equipped with multiple weapons, including machine guns, anti-armor rounds, and wide area of effect mortars. The protagonist's primary tank is the <i>Edelweiss</i>, an experimental high-mobility unit developed during the First Europan War. Tanks can be upgraded in the hangar by attaching special equipment or attribute-boosting parts.</p><h3 style="margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;">Medics (not playable)</h3><p>When a unit's HP reaches zero it will remain on the ground. If the unit remains there for three turns, or if an enemy touches them they will become completely incapacitated and be permanently removed from the game. As friendly units approach a downed ally, or upon an order from Welkin, a medic can be called, evacuating the unit from battle to fight again later.</p><h2>Crossover Characters</h2><p>As a crossover feature, Valkyria Chronicles includes two playable characters from Sega's <a href="/skies-of-arcadia/3030-1609/" data-ref-id="3030-1609">Skies of Arcadia</a>, originally released on the <a href="/dreamcast/3045-37/" data-ref-id="3045-37">Dreamcast</a>.

When he first returns back to Bruhl, his hometown, he is arrested by Alica who accuses him of being an imperial spy. He uses the Edelweiss, his late father's tank, during combat. After holding the imperials off long enough, he allows the residents of Bruhl to escape. He and Alicia themselves then escape to Randgriz, capital of Gallia. There, Welkin sings up for the Gallian militia. He is appointed Squad Leader due to his exploits in Bruhl. During certain missions when he is not using the tank, Welkin is a scout unit. For a squad leader he is considered young. Initially his squad members are skeptical of his leadership abilities, but after demonstrating his military genius, combined with his extensive knowledge of nature, he formulates a plan to drive his tank across a river and launch a surprise attack on the enemies camp. After this, the squad's members don't question him and soon develop a liking to him. As the game progresses, he soon brings all of the squad members together, to the point where they start to consider each other as family.

Because of this, Isara vows to repay Welkin, and she decides to do this by building him an airplane, so that he may fly. During the game's time period, only a couple of other planes exist.

Consequently, he swears to have his vengeance and to gain control of the Empire.</p><h3><a href="/selvaria-bles/3005-10397/" data-ref-id="3005-10397">Selvaria Bles</a> - Part of the Drei Stern</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15434/546667-vb05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-546667" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.562" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15434/546667-vb05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-546667"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="546667-vb05.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15434/546667-vb05.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15434/546667-vb05.jpg" alt="546667-vb05.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>She serves Maximilian with great loyalty. She has the unique powers of the Valkyrur. She awakens her power by wielding a spear and shield that the Valkyrur used in their time. Because of this, she is unstoppable in battle, even being able to reflect a tank shell with her Spear. She has a few childhood memories and remembers her mother's cooking fondly. Her mother was killed in some sort of attack, leaving Selvaria by herself. She is rescued by the Empire. However, after they realize her powers, she is taking to a lab in order to be experimented on. Maximillian saves her from the lab. This causes Selvaria to have an undying loyalty for him, to the point where she will give her life to realize his plans. She is also a proven commander and is in charge of the invasion of Central Gallia. She faces of against Squad 7 a total of three times. The first two times, she is invulnerable, but she can be forced to retreat by completing the mission's objective. She faces Squad 7 one last time at the fortress of Ghirlandaio, without her powers, and just as a normal woman. Squad 7 defeats her and she is taken prisoner by the Gallian army. As the militia leaves the fortress to escort the other imperial prisoners away, she uses the Valkyrur's final flame, sacrificing her life to wipe out the entirety of Gallia's army in a massive explosion. This gives Maximillian the opening to attack Randgriz directly.</p><h3><a href="/berthold-gregor/3005-14929/" data-ref-id="3005-14929">Berthold Gregor</a> - The oldest of the Drei Stern</h3><figure data-ref-id="1300-2698048" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/8/82063/2698048-berthold_gregor_profile.jpg" data-size="small" data-align="right" data-ratio="0.75849056603774" data-width="265" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 265px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/8/82063/2698048-berthold_gregor_profile.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2698048"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2698048-berthold_gregor_profile.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2698048-berthold_gregor_profile.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2698048-berthold_gregor_profile.jpg" alt="2698048-berthold_gregor_profile.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>He also led the invasion of Fhirald, another Europan county. There, he had a face of with Fhirald's top general, Radi Jaeger. Gregor's leg was injured in this battle, and so he walks with a walking stick. Gregor is placed in charge of the Northern invasion of Gallia and captures Fouzen, Gallia's biggest industrial city. There he has a Darcsen work camp, analogous to real-life Nazi concentration camps. He runs the camp with a clear hate for Darcsens, and subjects them to toxic working conditions without pity. Gregor maintains order and defends the camp with an armored train, heavily armed and impervious to assault. It rides a railway that circles Fouzen from above, so that it may shoot down any opponent. The train also has long-range mortars. However, the train is defeated when Squad 7 detonate the railway bridge that the train is riding on, causing it to fall into the river valley and blow up, with Gregor in it.</p><h3><a href="/radi-jaeger/3005-14928/" data-ref-id="3005-14928">Radi Jaeger</a> - The last member of the Drei Stern</h3><figure data-ref-id="1300-2698050" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/8/82063/2698050-1339803-282px_eps_valkyria_radiyaeger.jpg" data-size="small" data-align="right" data-ratio="1" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/8/82063/2698050-1339803-282px_eps_valkyria_radiyaeger.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2698050"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2698050-1339803-282px_eps_valkyria_radiyaeger.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2698050-1339803-282px_eps_valkyria_radiyaeger.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2698050-1339803-282px_eps_valkyria_radiyaeger.jpg" alt="2698050-1339803-282px_eps_valkyria_radiyaeger.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>He is not from the Empire, but from another country called Fhirald. He managed to fight off the Empire for a long time, even though his army was smaller and less well equipped. He was eventually defeated. However, Maximilian was so impressed that he gave Jaeger a proposition. He asked him to fight for the Empire and be one of his generals, and when the Empire has seized Gallia, Maximilian will give back Fhirald's independence. He fights with chivalry, and likes when his enemies do the same. He shows respect to everyone he meets, and also shows respect for his enemies. He is in charge of the Empire's tank division and is said to have won his battles by using "Advanced Tank Tactics". He drives a very powerful tank called Lupus Regnum, that has an outer armor shell. He is placed in charge of the Southern invasion of Gallia. Near the end of the game, Squad 7 faces off with Jaeger. Jaeger is defeated and his tank destroyed. He congratulates Squad 7 and resigns from the Imperial army, having recognized the strength of the squad's will to fight for their homeland as he fought for his.</p><h2>PC System Requirements</h2><h3>Minimum</h3><ul><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows Vista/Windows 7</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core2 Duo @ 2.0GHz (or equivalent)</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2 GB RAM</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> NVIDIA GeForce GTS 240 (or equivalent)</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong> 25 GB available space</li></ul><h3>Recommended</h3><ul><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 7</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core2 Duo @ 2.8GHz (or equivalent)</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 3 GB RAM</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> NVIDIA GeForce GTX 280 (or equivalent)</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong> 25 GB available space</li></ul>]]></description>

      <deck><![CDATA[APB Reloaded is a persistent online shooter created by Real Time Worlds, developer of Crackdown, in which players are able to choose between enforcers and criminals as they duke it out in the streets of San Paro.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview   </h2>APB (All Points Bulletin) is an <a data-ref-id="3015-1729" href="/classless-mmo/3015-1729/">                                              MMOG</a><a href="/"> </a>, as  well as the latest creation  from <a data-ref-id="3040-767" href="/david-jones/3040-767/">                                             David Jones</a><a href="/"> </a>  and<a href="/"> </a> <a data-ref-id="3010-2717" href="/realtime-worlds-ltd/3010-2717/">                                            Realtime Worlds</a>, the developer of the well-received <a data-ref-id="3030-4065" href="/crackdown/3030-4065/"> <i>Crackdown</i></a>.<a href="/"> </a>  Set in a modern, fictional, urban city, the game pits law enforcement  against  gangs, as they both aim to wipe each other out. According to the   developer, this will be the first MMORPG in which the player's own  skill,  not the amount of time invested, would be the main factor in  character  progression. There have been several rumors surrounding the  game,  including that<a href="/"> </a> <a data-ref-id="3010-1194" href="/rockstar-games/3010-1194/">                                          Rockstar Games</a> was planning on  purchasing APB in order to turn it into a <a data-ref-id="3025-6" href="/grand-theft-auto/3025-6/">                                         Grand Theft Auto</a><a href="/"> </a>  MMORPG.<br /> <br />You can purchase a retail version of APB either in-store or via  digital download at standard retail price.  The game includes 50 hours of action game play out of the box plus  unlimited time in APB's social districts. Once your game time is up, you will have the option of buying another 20 hours for $7, or a monthly subscription for $10/month. You will also have the possibility to sell your customized designs for RTW points, which can be used to buy extended game time.<br /><br />The  quests given by <a data-ref-id="3015-967" href="/non-player-character/3015-967/">                                                    NPC</a>s will be more focused  on the <a href="/">                                                                                      PvP</a>  aspect of the game. The main game  designer <a data-ref-id="3040-33179" href="/e-j-moreland/3040-33179/">                                     EJ Moreland</a> says that, for  example, in other MMOs, players  are asked to get 10 bat wings. In APB,  you will have to kill other  players to get whatever the NPC requires.  The enforcers will be  required to protect the common NPCs (citizens),  patrol the streets, and  catch wanted criminals.  <br /><br />Rather than rely on a traditional <a data-ref-id="3015-39" href="/experience-points/3015-39/">                                    XP</a> leveling system, APB uses a form of <a data-ref-id="3015-2163" href="/ranking-system/3015-2163/">                                   ranking</a> called Prestige (for Enforcers) and Notoriety (for Criminals). Able to both rise and fall, the system is designed to encourage players to play their chosen faction as intended. As a result, Enforcers can expect their Prestige to rise when making a successful arrest or fall by harming innocent bystanders, whereas Criminals will find their Notoriety increase by evading capture and decrease if arrested. APB will not feature typical MMO mechanics such as <a data-ref-id="3015-382" href="/skill-tree/3015-382/">                                 Talent Trees</a>, <a data-ref-id="3015-2220" href="/skill-points/3015-2220/">                                Skill Points</a> or even <a data-ref-id="3015-405" href="/classes/3015-405/">                               Classes</a>, instead players are able to customize the role of their character by using the in-game currency to purchase upgrades.<br /><br />Professions in APB will also be very different compared to existing MMOs and, if anything, is more comparable to games such as <a data-ref-id="3030-24995" href="/forza-motorsport-3/3030-24995/">                              Forza Motorsport 3</a>. Players will be able to earn in-game currency by creating various items and then selling them via a <a data-ref-id="3015-2136" href="/auction-house/3015-2136/">                             Auction House</a>. Created items can vary greatly, from unique artwork and vinyl, to custom clothing and even heavily modified vehicles.     <br /><br /><h2>Factions <br /></h2>Designed around the common 'cops vs. robbers' theme, APB will feature only 2 factions - Enforcers and Criminals. Each faction will have multiple organizations that players may choose to align themselves with however there will be no character classes as such. <br /><br /><h3>Enforcers    </h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1750/1329647-larocha.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1329647" data-size="medium" style="width: 395px" data-ratio="2.1012658227848" data-width="395" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:210.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1750/1329647-larocha.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1329647"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1750/1329647-larocha.jpg" alt="  Sometimes a badge is all that separates the enforcers from the criminals. "></a><figcaption>  Sometimes a badge is all that separates the enforcers from the criminals. </figcaption></figure>     Not your typical policeman, Enforcers are deputized mercenaries tasked with cleaning up the city of San-Paro. Given a gun and a badge, they have the freedom to enforce the law however they see fit, but reckless use of lethal force carries consequences. <br /> <br />Fresh-faced recruits have the option of aligning themselves with one of two enforcer organizations, the Praetorians or the Prentiss Tigers. Each featuring their own unique chain of command, players are able to work their way up the ranks of their chosen organization by accepting missions from <a data-ref-id="3015-967" href="/non-player-character/3015-967/">                                                                       NPC</a> contacts. As the player progresses, the will receive missions from increasingly higher ranking contacts <br /> <br />Enforcers are incentivised to adhere to a code of conduct that prohibits such things as harming innocent <a data-ref-id="3015-967" href="/non-player-character/3015-967/">                                                                      NPC</a> bystanders or dangerous driving and rewards using non-lethal force whenever possible. That however is not to say Enforcers must be squeaky clean, with infractions often able to be overlooked by bribing a contact within your organization. <br /><br /><h3>Criminals    </h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1750/1329648-yodawg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1329648" data-size="medium" style="width: 419px" data-ratio="2.0286396181384" data-width="419" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:202.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1750/1329648-yodawg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1329648"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1750/1329648-yodawg.jpg" alt="  He dares you to try spotting all of his stereotypical clichés.  "></a><figcaption>  He dares you to try spotting all of his stereotypical clichés.  </figcaption></figure>     Thug, gang-banger or just an all round bad guy. Whatever you call them, Criminals are motivated by two things - money and power.

This type of activity doesn't stay unopposed for long however, as patrolling enforcers are able to report any witnessed criminal activity resulting in the immediate dispatch of other rank-matched enforcers.  <br /> <h2>Location</h2> <p>Set in the fictional west-coast metropolis of San  Paro, APB divides the city into three distinct districts. Two of which,  the Financial District and the Waterfront District serve as the main  staging areas for APB’s combat heavy gameplay, while the Social District  focuses on friends, clans and customization as well as having an  increased population cap.  <br /></p><table class="t-editor full-width with-out-border"><tbody><tr><td><h3>Financial District </h3> <figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1750/1330981-official_20090914_1272921200.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1330981" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.56153846153846" data-width="480" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1750/1330981-official_20090914_1272921200.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1330981"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="1330981-official_20090914_1272921200.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1750/1330981-official_20090914_1272921200.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1750/1330981-official_20090914_1272921200.jpg" alt="1330981-official_20090914_1272921200.jpg"></noscript></a></figure> With its numerous  skyscrapers and narrow alleyways, the Financial  District encourages  players to leave their vehicles behind and take to  the streets to engage  in intense fire fights. The types of missions  players can expect to  experience include bomb planting/defusing,  graffiti tagging/clean-up and  evidence gathering/destroying. Financial  District instances currently  have a population cap of 100 and occupy  the space of roughly 40 city  blocks.  <br /></td></tr><tr><td><h3>Waterfront District </h3> <figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1750/1330984-pcg208.feat_apb.gen10__article_image.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1330984" data-size="medium" style="width: 418px" data-ratio="0.5622009569378" data-width="418" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1750/1330984-pcg208.feat_apb.gen10__article_image.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1330984"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="1330984-pcg208.feat_apb.gen10__article_image.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1750/1330984-pcg208.feat_apb.gen10__article_image.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1750/1330984-pcg208.feat_apb.gen10__article_image.jpg" alt="1330984-pcg208.feat_apb.gen10__article_image.jpg"></noscript></a></figure> While similar in  size and scope to the Financial district (roughly 40  city blocks and a  population cap of 100), the Waterfront Distinct  carries its own unique  look and feel. With wide roads and a coastline  that stretches the entire  length of the map, car chases and massive  shootouts become a much more  common sight. Missions available in this  district include vehicle  escort/ambush, property raiding/defending and  time limited deliveries.   <br /></td></tr><tr><td><h3>Social District </h3> <figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1750/1330983-apbscreen09web.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1330983" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5595703125" data-width="480" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1750/1330983-apbscreen09web.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1330983"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="1330983-apbscreen09web.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1750/1330983-apbscreen09web.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1750/1330983-apbscreen09web.jpg" alt="1330983-apbscreen09web.jpg"></noscript></a></figure> Removing itself of  all combat, instead the Social District focuses on  player interaction,  clan organization/recruiting and APB’s extensive  customization features,  including character and vehicle design as well  as music creation. All  Social District instances have an increased  population cap of 250  however the map size is significantly smaller due  to the absence of  vehicles. The district also acts as a way to reward  the best players by  displaying posters and billboards featuring their  character. Other  mechanics unique to the Social District include  jukeboxes that play  custom music to all players in its immediate  vicinity and cinemas  screening mission replays. <br /></td></tr></tbody></table> <br /><h2>Customization <br /></h2>As one of the most heavily promoted aspects of the game, APB features an array of utilities that allow for the in-game customization of your character, vehicles and even music.    <br /><br /><table class="t-editor full-width with-out-border"><tbody><tr><td><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1750/1330985-ss_preview_6.jpg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1330985" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.8" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1750/1330985-ss_preview_6.jpg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1330985"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Character  Creator " class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1750/1330985-ss_preview_6.jpg.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1750/1330985-ss_preview_6.jpg.jpg" alt="Character  Creator "></noscript></a><figcaption>Character  Creator </figcaption></figure><h3>Character <br /></h3>        Similar to most other MMO's, APB allows  the player to choose their initial physical appearance such as gender,  race and hair style. While many of these things can be changed at a  later date, the prohibitively high cost of doing so suggests that care  should be taken during initial creation. All newly created characters  spawn with default clothing which can then be highly customized using  various pre-made items or create your own using the in-game design  tools.   <br /></td></tr><tr><td><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1750/1329781-apb_20100407103005586.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1329781" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.70967741935484" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:71.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1750/1329781-apb_20100407103005586.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1329781"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt=" Car Customiser" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1750/1329781-apb_20100407103005586.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1750/1329781-apb_20100407103005586.jpg" alt=" Car Customiser"></noscript></a><figcaption> Car Customiser</figcaption></figure><h3>Vehicle </h3>Similar to the character creator, players are able to  customize virtually every aspect of their vehicle.

Once created, players are able to deploy themes so they can be  heard during various parts of the PvP based mission structure (such as  arresting other players, winning a mission, etc...). In addition to  this, you can create songs, which are longer variants of themes that can  be played from a players vehicle, or from the social district music  performance points. <br /></td></tr></tbody></table>  <br /><h2>VoIP<br /></h2>APB uses Vivox voice technology for voice chat. In addition to standard group voice chat functionality, Realtime Worlds also implemented 3D positional voice chat that accounts for position of the speaker and relative distance.  <br /> <br /><h3>Controversy<br /></h3>Realtime Worlds implemented a controversial audio advertising system in APB for VoIP users. Under the default VoIP plan, players will hear a five to fifteen second audio advertisement while switching between districts. According to Realtime Worlds, the ads will play no more than once every three hours.    <br /> <br />Users can also choose to completely disable audio advertisements by purchasing VoIP premium passes that remove all audio advertisements for 30, 60, 90, or 180 days in exchange for a fee. <br /><br /><h2>Payment Models <br /></h2>Included with the game is unlimited access to the Social District and 50 hours of playtime in the action districts (Financial and Waterfront). Once the 50 hours is up, players can choose between three different payment methods. <br /> <br /><table class="t-editor full-width with-out-border"><tbody><tr><th>Unlimited Access<br /></th><th>Pay-As-You-Go</th><th>RTW Points<br /></th></tr><tr><td><ul class="plain-list"><li>Unlimited gameplay for 30 days</li><li>Pay monthly ($9.99/£7.99/€8.99)</li></ul></td><td><ul class="plain-list"><li>20 Hours of game time (never expires) in the action districts<br /></li><li>$6.99/£5.59/€6.29</li></ul></td><td><ul class="plain-list"><li>Exchange in-game currency for gameplay time </li><li>Earn points only by selling your creations on the market place to other players</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><br />Regardless of payment method, players will always have access to the Social District (even when their game time expires).  <br /><br /><h2>System Requirements</h2> <i>These are based on requirements for beta testing, noted as of 24th February 2010.</i><br /><table class="t-editor full-width with-out-border"><tbody><tr><th>Minimum</th><th>Recommended<br /></th></tr><tr><td><ul class="plain-list"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows XP</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Core 2 Duo 2.13 GHz or equivalent</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2GM RAM</li><li><strong>Video:</strong> NVidia GeForce 7800 256MB</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong> 15GB</li><li><strong>Sound:</strong> DirectX 9</li><li><strong>Internet:</strong> Broadband connection required to install and play    </li></ul> </td><td><ul class="plain-list"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows Vista / Windows 7 (recommend a 64-bit operating system)</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 2.4GHz Intel Core 2 Quad or equivalent</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4GB RAM</li><li><strong>Video:</strong> NVidia GeForce 8800 GTX 512MB or equivalent</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong> 15GB</li><li><strong>Sound:</strong> DirectX 9</li><li><strong>Internet:</strong> Broadband connection required to install and play    </li></ul> </td></tr></tbody></table> <br /><h2>Soundtrack <br /></h2>APB sports over a 160 song soundtrack list.  <br /><br /><ul class="plain-list"><li>Mad World -  <b>Tears for Fears</b></li><li>Favourite Jeans -  <b>Bertie Blackman</b></li><li>Rational Gaze -  <b>Meshuggah</b></li><li>Beautiful Tomorrow -  <b>Beth Rowley</b></li><li>Riot Act -  <b>Exodus</b></li><li>Johnny Got A Boom Boom -  <b>Imelda May</b></li><li>Heat -  <b>Recordkingz</b></li><li>So Fine -  <b>Telepathe</b></li><li>Death -  <b>White Lies</b></li><li>Zero -  <b>Yeah Yeah Yeahs</b></li><li>Courage -  <b>Alien Ant Farm</b></li><li>Gimme That Punk -  <b>Audio Bullys</b></li><li>Lava Lava -  <b>Boys Noize</b></li><li>Mercury -  <b>Clutch</b></li><li>Progenies of the Great Apocalypse -  <b>Dimmu Borgir</b></li><li>Central Park -  <b>Division of Laura Lee</b></li><li>Bright Lights -  <b>The Ghost of A Thousand</b></li><li>Come Clarity -  <b>In Flames </b></li><li>Hermaploitation 74 -  <b>Herma Puma</b></li><li>The Shape Of Punk To Come -  <b>Refus</b></li><li>Under The Knife -  <b>Rise Against</b></li><li>John Q Public -  <b>Anomie Belle </b></li><li>The Truth -  <b>Bulletproof Messenger</b></li><li>Fang -  <b>Druu</b> </li><li>Silhouette -  <b>Fono</b> </li><li>Battle Front -  <b>Rareform</b></li><li>Zookeeper -  <b>Honey Claws</b></li><li>Brotherhood of the Drum -  <b>KJ Sawka</b></li><li>Children Of Neon Lights -  <b>La Fleur Fatale</b></li><li>Hawk Eyes -  <b>Leopold And His Fiction </b></li><li>Viva La Revolucion -  <b>Love in October</b></li><li>A Lot Of Us (Feat.

Barely 2 months after release (2 months and 17 days)   Ben 'APBMonkey' Bateman posted the below message. The forums were also shut down at this time. <blockquote><p>"APB has been a fantastic journey, but unfortunately that journey has come to a premature end. Today we are sad to announce that despite everyone's best efforts to keep the service running; APB is coming to a close. It's been a pleasure working on APB and with all its players. Together we were building an absolutely amazing game, and for that, we thank you. You guys are awesome!</p>From all of the Realtime World staff we thank you for your continued support."       </blockquote>Gamersfirst, a free-to-play MMO company, subsequently acquired and relaunched APB as a free-to-play MMO.  It was renamed APB Reloaded.<br /><h2>Intellectual Property Sale</h2>The BBC <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-11333582" rel="nofollow">        reported </a>that the APB administrators were looking to sell the intellectual property rights due to the game's closure. One potential buyer was <a data-ref-id="3010-149" href="/epic-games/3010-149/">    Epic Games</a>. It was speculated that Epic would have a less difficult time getting APB up and running again because the game uses Epic's <a data-ref-id="3015-86" href="/unreal-engine-3/3015-86/">   Unreal Engine</a>. Epic's spokesperson <a data-ref-id="3040-79471" href="/dana-cowley/3040-79471/">  Dana Cowley</a> did not comment directly on that issue. However, she did say, "<a data-ref-id="3040-6850" href="/mark-a-rein/3040-6850/"> Mark (Rein)</a> absolutely loves APB, and everyone here loved what they saw."     <br /> <br /><h2>Compensation <br /></h2>After the closure of APB, EA offered compensation to the people who invested money in APB. This allowed people (who could prove they had bought the game) to pick something from the EA store of equal value, including:<br /><ul class="plain-list"><li><a data-ref-id="3030-25246" href="/battlefield-bad-company-2/3030-25246/">        Bad Company 2 </a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3030-14139" href="/spore/3030-14139/">        Spore </a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3025-1609" href="/dragon-age/3025-1609/">        Dragon Age</a> </li><li><a data-ref-id="3030-17463" href="/the-sims/3030-17463/">        The Sims </a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3030-26702" href="/fifa-10/3030-26702/">        Fifa 10</a></li></ul>]]></description>

Darksiders is <a href="/vigil-games/3010-6304/" data-ref-id="3010-6304">Vigil Games</a>' debut title, and is published by <a href="/thq/3010-15/" data-ref-id="3010-15">THQ</a> (in North America and Europe) and <a href="/konami-corporation/3010-87/" data-ref-id="3010-87">Konami</a> (in Japan). The game is loosely based on the book of Revelations in the Bible. Vigil took the concepts of the <a href="/horsemen-of-the-apocalypse/3015-4533/" data-ref-id="3015-4533">Four Horsemen</a>, the Apocalypse, Heaven and Hell, Angels and Demons, among other references, and created their own take and mythology on them.</p><p>Darksiders tells the story of <a href="/war/3005-997/" data-ref-id="3005-997">War</a>, one of the Four Horsemen who is blamed for the destruction of humanity in a premature battle between Heaven and Hell. The game sold well, estimated at 1.2 million units worldwide in the four weeks after release. Its success has led not only to a <a href="/darksiders-ii/3030-29941/" data-ref-id="3030-29941">sequel</a>, but also a planned film adaptation being written by Darksiders creator <a href="/joe-madureira/3040-27284/" data-ref-id="3040-27284">Joe Madureira</a>.</p><p>The game received generally positive reviews. It obtained 83% on Gamerankings on both console platforms and 82% on PC; whilst on Metacritic the game obtained 82% on PS3 and 83% on both the PC and Xbox 360 platforms. Critics lauded the game for being the "dark <a href="/the-legend-of-zelda/3025-9/" data-ref-id="3025-9">Zelda</a>" that <a href="/nintendo/3010-90/" data-ref-id="3010-90">Nintendo</a> will never make; praising the voice acting, combat, environments, and puzzle design.</p><p>Notably, the Watcher is voiced by <a href="../../mark-hamill/72-3248/" rel="nofollow">Mark Hamill</a>. Additionally of note is the initial screen tearing issue that the Xbox 360 version suffered from (now fixed via a patch). Because of this, and minor framerate issues, the PlayStation 3 version had a <i>slightly</i> better initial reception.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14440/1441036-darksiders_01_lg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1441036" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.59" data-width="480" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:59.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14440/1441036-darksiders_01_lg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1441036"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14440/1441036-darksiders_01_lg.jpg" alt="War, one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, and his sword."></a><figcaption>War, one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, and his sword.</figcaption></figure><p>Darksiders tells the story of War, one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (the others being <a href="/strife/3005-11418/" data-ref-id="3005-11418">Strife</a>, <a href="/fury/3005-3436/" data-ref-id="3005-3436">Fury</a>, and <a href="../../death/94-11419/" rel="nofollow">Death</a>), and his role in the aftermath of a premature Armageddon. Upon receiving a summon for the end times to begin, War throws himself into the midst of the battle between angels and demons and quickly finds out that he is the only Horsemen to have arrived on Earth. While fighting against both sides, War mysteriously loses his powers and is eventually beaten by one of the Destroyer's chosen, <a href="/straga/3005-14546/" data-ref-id="3005-14546">Straga</a>. Confused and defeated, War is brought before the <a href="/the-charred-council/3005-18025/" data-ref-id="3005-18025">Charred Council</a>, a neutral governing body responsible for upholding the ancient truce between Heaven and Hell, until the day the Kingdom of Man is strong enough to do battle in the end war. They maintain the balance of power between the three kingdoms, and the Horsemen are their enforcers.</p><p>The Charred Council summarily charges War with the untimely destruction of the Kingdom of Man, disregarding the Council's law, and upsetting the Balance. For his actions, War is sentenced to death. Rather than consign himself to oblivion, War demands he be sent back to the realm of Earth to discover who was behind the Apocalypse, so that he may clear his name, and restore his rightful status as a Horseman. If he should fail, the Council's justice would be satisfied.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1087645-942006_20090721_screen004.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1087645" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5875" data-width="480" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:58.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1087645-942006_20090721_screen004.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1087645"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="The Watcher." class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1048/1087645-942006_20090721_screen004.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1048/1087645-942006_20090721_screen004.jpg" alt="The Watcher."></noscript></a><figcaption>The Watcher.</figcaption></figure><p>Agreeing to these terms the Council grants War the use of his sword, <a href="/chaoseater/3055-3483/" data-ref-id="3055-3483">Chaoseater</a>. Before he can leave however, War is saddled with 'The Watcher', a demon entity who will act as the eyes and ears of the Charred Council, and with whom rests the power to destroy War at a whim. Upon returning to Earth, War discovers that 100 years have passed since the Apocalypse, and sets out on his quest to discover the truth behind what happened to his fellow Horsemen, why the Apocalypse was brought about early, and to what end these actions have been set in motion.</p><p>Earth is now a desolate wasteland, barely resembling its former shape. Humankind has long since crumbled, due to <a href="/the-destroyer/3005-14094/" data-ref-id="3005-14094">The Destroyer</a>'s army of demons. War begins his journey and soon meets Vulgrim, a Soul Trader who specializes in equipment, but also dabbles in information. He tells War to seek out the fallen demon <a href="/samael/3005-3129/" data-ref-id="3005-3129">Samael</a>. Threatened by his great power, the Destroyer had Samael imprisoned, and if War sets him free, he would be inclined to help his endeavor.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1294612-48160_tiamat_fly_by_531x298_custom.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1294612" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.56120527306968" data-width="480" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1294612-48160_tiamat_fly_by_531x298_custom.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1294612"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Tiamat, the first of the Four Chosen." class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/1294612-48160_tiamat_fly_by_531x298_custom.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/1294612-48160_tiamat_fly_by_531x298_custom.jpg" alt="Tiamat, the first of the Four Chosen."></noscript></a><figcaption>Tiamat, the first of the Four Chosen.</figcaption></figure><p>To gain access into the Black Tower of the Destroyer, Samael tells War that he needs to fight the Four Chosen of The Destroyer, the tower guardians, and bring him their hearts. Along the way, Samael grants War some abilities to help him complete his quest. He even helps War tap into his dormant powers and assume his chaos form, at the expense of the Watcher getting a gauntlet to the face.</p><p>War sets out to find each of the Four Chosen. The first is <a href="/tiamat/3005-12513/" data-ref-id="3005-12513">Tiamat</a>, the bat queen. On the path to the second of the Four Chosen, War meets Ulthane, an Old One and a legendary weapon-smith. After a small Pigeon (angel) killing contest, he asks War to prove himself by killing <a href="/the-griever/3005-14640/" data-ref-id="3005-14640">the Griever</a>, second of the chosen. Upon his return, War finds that Ulthane has made him a gun; Mercy.</p><p>On his journey to find the <a href="/the-stygian/3005-14548/" data-ref-id="3005-14548">Stygian</a>, third of the Chosen, War comes across a demon arena. After some fighting, the demon leader emerges riding on War's former mount, the shadowy steed Ruin. War manages to defeat the demon lord but Ruin, not recognizing his friend and master, proceeds to attack him and knocking him around. The Watcher orders War to kill Ruin seeing as he seems to have lost his mind, but he refuses, and instead sets his sword aside and stands his ground. Ruin proceeds to charge at War and at the last second phases through him, having recognized him again. Thusly mounted, War becomes a Horseman again.</p><p>Before his fight with the last of the tower guardians, <a href="/silitha/3005-14547/" data-ref-id="3005-14547">Silitha</a> the Broodmother, she tells War that Samael was misleading him; the Chosen were not guarding the tower, but in fact were guarding against Samael's return to power. That power which the Destroyer stripped and placed inside the hearts of the Chosen. She warned that if Samael regains his power, War would find a bigger threat in him than all of the Chosen combined. War foolishly ignores her and proceeds with the fight.</p><p>After War returns all the Chosen's hearts to Samael, he boasts that he has become like a god, that he could kill War in an instant if he so chooses. Yet he still grants War passage to the Black Tower as promised as he empathizes with War's quest for revenge. Samael opens a portal to the tower and just before War steps through, the Horseman declares that they will meet again.</p><p>Finally in the Black Tower, War finds Azrael, the Angel of Death, imprisoned inside. He reveals everything about the events that led up to the premature battle between Heaven and Hell, about Abbadon's and Ulthane's involvement. Abbadon, Lord of the Hellguard angels, decided to launch a premature strike on the forces of hell and enlisted the others' help to break six of the seven seals that would start the final battle. The seventh, which if broken would call the Horsemen, was to be left intact. He was sure that his armies would decimate the forces of Hell before the war even began, and they would reforge the seals as if nothing had happened. It would look like Hell had started the war and Heaven responded. After all, who would the Council believe; Heaven's word or that of the "Prince of Lies"? However, they were surprised to discover that by the time the Hellguard arrived on Earth, the entire military might of Hell had already arrived, and thus, butchered the Hellguard before the rest of Heaven's armies could arrive, thereby winning the war in the name of Evil.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1294613-azrael.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1294613" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.55034482758621" data-width="480" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:55.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1294613-azrael.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1294613"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Azrael leads War into the Garden of Eden." class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/1294613-azrael.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/1294613-azrael.jpg" alt="Azrael leads War into the Garden of Eden."></noscript></a><figcaption>Azrael leads War into the Garden of Eden.</figcaption></figure><p>With these developments, War decides his deal with the Charred Council is complete; he was innocent. The Watcher decides otherwise, that War must do his duty to restore Balance and kill Azrael for breaking the Law of the Council. Instead, War proceeds to free Azrael, and defeat <a href="/straga/3005-14546/" data-ref-id="3005-14546">Straga</a>, last and most powerful of the Chosen. Afterwards, Azrael takes him into the Garden of Eden to seek the Tree of Knowledge. There, War is granted the "gift" of truth and receives a vision. He sees the events that lead to the Apocalypse, the fate of Abbadon, and things that are yet to come.</p><p>When Abbadon was killed by Straga, he was surrounded in darkness and a mysterious, sinister female voice gave him the choice to "Serve in Heaven, or rule in Hell?". Abbadon chose the latter and took up the mantle of the Destroyer, now leading the forces of Hell and guarding the seventh seal. War also sees <a href="/uriel/3005-17037/" data-ref-id="3005-17037">Uriel</a> (Abbadon's second-in-command, who harbors romantic feelings for him and blames War for his death) leading the remaining Hellguard against the Destroyer, and failing. War is shown that the Charred Council foresaw Abbadon's plan for a preemptive strike. They needed to quell Abbadon's defiance but could not send the Horsemen against him and the others without proof since the seals were reforged. The Horsemen would see it as murder, not justice. War was known for his temper and pride, and the Council framed him knowing that he would "slaughter everyone in his way" to clear his name. Finally, he sees himself being killed, stabbed in the back by a large blade. As War recovers from the vision, he finds the handle of the same blade in his hand.</p><p>Azrael provides one more piece of wisdom before War sets out to face the Destroyer; the only weapon capable of killing The Destroyer is the Armageddon Blade. The same blade the angels used to break the seals, and Ulthane's greatest work. It was shattered by the Destroyer and hidden in the realm of shadows, War needed to gather the pieces and bring them back to Ulthane to make it anew. During the search for the pieces, War is confronted by Uriel, who challenges him to an ancient pact, an unbreakable vow that will not end until one of them has died by the other's hand. War defeats Uriel in combat, but spares her life to keep her as an ally - for now. Whether or not he wants to, eventually he is going to have to kill her or be killed <i>by</i> her to break the spell upon them.</p><p>With the completed Armageddon Blade in hand, Azrael sends War to face the Destroyer, a massive fiery dragon.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1294618-picture_1.png" data-ref-id="1300-1294618" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.43483275663206" data-width="480" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:43.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1294618-picture_1.png" data-ref-id="1300-1294618"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="The Destroyer." class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/1294618-picture_1.png"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/1294618-picture_1.png" alt="The Destroyer."></noscript></a><figcaption>The Destroyer.</figcaption></figure><p>Abbadon offers that War join him, arguing the corruption of the Council and that he will be pursued by both Heaven and Hell. He gives War the same choice that he was given "Serve in Heaven, or rule in Hell?", to which War answers: "I choose what once a coward did not", and proceeds to fight, victoriously. Having killed Abbadon, War reaches for the seventh seal, but the Watcher constrains him and taunts him as he takes the Seventh Seal out of his reach, War's ticket to freedom. Seeing what is happening, Uriel stabs War in the back - simultaneously breaking the hold the Watcher has over him and fulfilling their death pact - and then breaks the Seventh Seal during a strike on the Watcher. In addition to severing the Watcher's right arm, breaking the Seventh Seal summons the Four Horsemen: this means that War is resurrected, all of his strength and power restored. Free of the Charred Council's control, War stands up and kills the Watcher. Now an enemy of Heaven, Hell, <i>and</i> the Charred Council, Uriel asks if he will fight the entire universe alone. War lifts the broken seal in his hand saying; "No. Not alone." Three comets streak across the sky, signalling the arrival of the other three Horsemen.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The combat centres primarily on powerful combos and specialty fatalities. War can equip a gear item alongside his primary weapon, allowing him to switch on the fly between the Crossblade and the Abyssal Chain, for example. Using powerful combos allows War to fill his Wrath Meter which he can then use to unleash powerful Wrath attacks. Wrath attacks include the Blade Geyser attack, where War stabs the ground and makes half-a-dozen blades come up from the ground and damage enemies around him; Stone Skin, which decreases the damage War takes, and increases the damage he dishes out; Immolation, which causes everything War touches to become engulfed in flames; and Pestilence, which slowly saps away surrounding enemies' health. War can also use special fatalities. For instance, War can jump from demonic bat to demonic bat, killing each one without touching the ground. War will also perform more stylized fatalities on bosses and mid-bosses without the need for the derivative quick time events. It should also be noted that War is actually invulnerable during these execution animations. The player can use this to advantage, interrupting the attacks of enemies in order to slow down the combat a little. An example of such an execution is shown in the Church dungeon area where War fights The Jailor, a massive hulk of flesh that smashes cages on the ground.

War will traverse each of these dungeons killing bosses and mini-bosses to progress throughout the game as well as retrieving gear items. Gear items are featured equipment which War needs in order to open new areas within the large open hubs.</p><p>New equipment can also be purchased by selling souls collected by War's Soul Harvest ability to a Soul Trader Demon, Vulgrim. This demon will trade souls and artifacts, the only applicable currency in a post-human world, for new abilities, weapons and armor. These souls can be collected primarily in combat, but can also be found through exploration. Weapons can also be customized by collecting upgrades throughout the game. These upgrades can be equipped and swapped between War's arsenal of weapons. Armor can also be upgraded into the Abyssal Armor by finding the ten pieces throughout the game (the new armor is immediately worn by War upon finding the final piece). With this new armor, War also changes in appearance, from his red, blue, and black, to a more bad-ass gray and black with red-eyes. Health and Wrath capacity can also be increased by collected containers scattered throughout the world, defeating main bosses, and from Vulgrim.</p><p>Weapons and armor aren't the only thing at War's disposal, for he can call on his spectral steed, Ruin. War is able to summon and dispel him on the fly with the touch of the shoulder buttons, and enables him to traverse areas he could not on foot. Ruin has access to a dash ability. War's sword attacks also increase drastically in power while he is on Ruin. War's sword, Chaoseater, accumulates chaos as he kills enemies. Once it is full, he can then transform into a large and powerful form (his Chaos Form), for a limited time, and can lay waste to most enemies with ease.</p><h2>Souls</h2><p>There are three types of souls that can be found in the world of Darksiders, and they can either be found inside <a href="/treasure-chest/3055-517/" data-ref-id="3055-517">chests</a> (the type of soul inside each chest will be clearly identifiable by its color), or collected from enemies upon their defeat:</p><ul><li><b>Green Souls</b> - these fill the <u>Health</u> bar.</li><li><b>Yellow Souls</b> - these fill the <u>Wrath</u> meter.</li><li><b>Blue Souls</b> - the game’s form of <u>Currency.</u></li></ul><h2>Enemies</h2><h3>Angels</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1543740-angel_champion.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1543740" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.94444444444444" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:94.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1543740-angel_champion.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1543740"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="1543740-angel_champion.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1543740-angel_champion.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1543740-angel_champion.jpg" alt="1543740-angel_champion.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>The Lords of Heaven are far less numerous on Earth than their demonic enemies, and they have been fighting to take back the dead Earth ever since the Apocalypse.

These come in three varieties:</p><h3>Passive</h3><p>Curiously, neither of the passive abilities were War's originally; both are gifts from the demon Samael to aid War on his quest..</p><ul><li><b>Chronomancy</b> - allows War to slow down time.</li><li><b>Shadowflight</b> - allows War to glide for a limited amount of time after performing a double jump.</li></ul><h3>Wrath Consuming</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1554352-blade_geyser.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1554352" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1554352-blade_geyser.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1554352"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="The Blade Geyser in action." class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1554352-blade_geyser.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1554352-blade_geyser.jpg" alt="The Blade Geyser in action."></noscript></a><figcaption>The Blade Geyser in action.</figcaption></figure><ul><li><b>Affliction</b> - War summons serpent-like creatures to aid him in combat.</li><li><b>Blade Geyser</b> - War slams the ground beneath and blades sprout all around him, harming any enemies in range and pushing them back.</li><li><b>Immolation</b> - this allows for War to set himself on fire, thus causing enemies who come within melee range to catch on fire themselves, causing damage.</li><li><b>Stoneskin</b> - War's skin becomes... stone; this makes him more resistant to any kind of damage while also improving his dealt damage.</li></ul><h3>Chaos Consuming</h3><ul><li><b>Chaos Form</b> - striking opponents with the Chaoseater causes the Chaos gauge to fill up and when it is full, War can activate his Chaos Form, which is undoubtedly War's most powerful ability.

The game went into development about five years before its release. After founding Vigil Games, the designers were very drawn to the concept of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Although the full development cycle didn't begin until two years later, many ideas and concepts came up during this two year period.</p><p>Most of the gameplay ideas that many consumers and critics said appeared to be taken from other games such as <a href="/god-of-war/3025-244/" data-ref-id="3025-244">God of War</a> and <a href="/the-legend-of-zelda/3025-9/" data-ref-id="3025-9">Zelda</a> were initially designed before the release of said games, according to development director of Vigil Games, <a href="/david-adams/3040-7052/" data-ref-id="3040-7052">David Adams</a>. Adams also stated that they did not have the specific intention to be similar to any other game, nor did they have any particular game that served as a source of inspiration. Instead, Vigil simply wanted to make a darker and more mature action adventure game.</p><p>According to post-release developer interviews, a significant amount of gameplay elements were removed before completion, mostly due to space or time constraints. These included items such as the Venom of Apollyon (described as "like a sticky grenade"), a dungeon based on light and dark themes, and an item which allowed the player to control undead armies. Another idea that was cut was Vigil's initial idea of a four-player co-op game, which they quickly found was "ridiculous."</p><p>Due to the cancellation of their own game, THQ contracted <a href="/silicon-knights-inc/3010-1004/" data-ref-id="3010-1004">Silicon Knights</a> to help Vigil out with asset creation during development of the game.</p><h2>Voice Talents</h2><ul><li>War - <a href="/liam-obrien/3040-97533/" data-ref-id="3040-97533">Liam O'Brien</a></li><li>The Watcher - <a href="/mark-hamill/3040-3248/" data-ref-id="3040-3248">Mark Hamil</a></li><li>Vulgrim - <a href="/phil-lamarr/3040-89594/" data-ref-id="3040-89594">Phil LaMarr</a></li><li>Samael - Vernon Wells</li><li>Azrael - <a href="/keith-szarabajka/3040-31078/" data-ref-id="3040-31078">Keith Szarabajka</a></li><li>Abaddon - <a href="/troy-baker/3040-93651/" data-ref-id="3040-93651">Troy Baker</a></li><li>Uriel - <a href="/moon-bloodgood/3040-15122/" data-ref-id="3040-15122">Moon Bloodgood</a></li><li>Tiamat - <a href="../../lani-minella/72-1961/" rel="nofollow">Lani Minella</a></li><li>Silitha - Lani Menella</li><li>Straga - <a href="/troy-baker/3040-93651/" data-ref-id="3040-93651">Troy Baker</a></li><li>Ulthane - <a href="/jb-blanc/3040-89365/" data-ref-id="3040-89365">JB Blanc</a></li><li>Charred Council - <a href="/fred-tatasciore/3040-63568/" data-ref-id="3040-63568">Fred Tatasciore</a></li><li>Tortured Gates - <a href="/troy-baker/3040-93651/" data-ref-id="3040-93651">Troy Baker</a></li></ul><h2>Warmastered Edition</h2><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/21/217562/2873384-dswme_key-artwork.png" data-ref-id="1300-2873384" data-ratio="1.4227799227799" data-width="960" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 960px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:142.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/21/217562/2873384-dswme_key-artwork.png" data-ref-id="1300-2873384"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Warmastered Edition key art" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/21/217562/2873384-dswme_key-artwork.png"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/21/217562/2873384-dswme_key-artwork.png" alt="Warmastered Edition key art"></noscript></a><figcaption>Warmastered Edition key art</figcaption></figure><p>A remastered version of the game from Nordic Games for the subsequent console generation arrived at the end of 2016 on PS4, Xbox One, Wii U and PC specifically.

Originally revealed as a <a href="/playstation-3/3045-35/" data-ref-id="3045-35">PlayStation 3</a> exclusive entitled Final Fantasy Versus XIII, it was later re-announced during <a href="/e3-2013/3015-7534/" data-ref-id="3015-7534">E3 2013</a> that its name had changed, and it had become the next game in the core <a href="/final-fantasy/3025-194/" data-ref-id="3025-194">Final Fantasy</a> franchise. It will be released worldwide for both the <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/" data-ref-id="3045-146">PlayStation 4</a> and <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/xbox-one/3045-145/" data-ref-id="3045-145">Xbox One </a>on September 30, 2016.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p>The story revolves around a prince, <a href="/noctis-lucis-caelum/3005-8162/" data-ref-id="3005-8162">Noctis Lucis Caelum</a>, who is the heir to the throne of the Kingdom of Lucis. Lucis has become more modernized than other nations, to the point where it resembles a contemporary city of modern Earth<i>.</i> It has isolated itself from the world in the process. The game's setting involves a war between Lucis and another nation called Niflheim as they fight for control of the world's last crystal, which Lucis possesses. The game begins after the end of a long cold war between warring nations and the world's crystals are involved in these conflicts in some way.</p><h2>Characters</h2><h3>Noctis</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56735/2502917-final+fantasy+xv.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2502917" data-ratio="1.413" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:141.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56735/2502917-final+fantasy+xv.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2502917"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/5/56735/2502917-final+fantasy+xv.jpg" alt="Noctis and his crew. From left to right: Prompto, Gladiolus, Noctis, Ignis, and Cor."></a><figcaption>Noctis and his crew. From left to right: Prompto, Gladiolus, Noctis, Ignis, and Cor.</figcaption></figure><p>Noctis is the last heir to the throne of a dynasty who are in charge of protecting the last crystal, and he has to protect the city from an enemy nation trying to steal the crystal. He is able to wield multiple swords, spears, and lances by materializing them out of thin air and controlling them with telekinesis. His weapons can also be used as shields. Noctis also has the ability to teleport and move at high speeds. His eyes change color from blue to red during battle, which is related to his teleportation ability.</p><h3>Noctis's Party</h3><p>Most of Noctis's party consists of his childhood friends: Ignis Stupeo Scientia, a strategist for the royal family who fights with a katana, Gladiolus Amicitia, a bodyguard of the royal family who fights bare-handed and with a giant greatsword, and Prompto Argentum, a foreign fugitive who wields firearms, despite their illegal status in Lucis. There is also Cor Leonis, a middle-aged military man who is sworn to serve Noctis and his father.</p><h3>Stella</h3><p>Noctis finds a counterpart in Stella Nox Fleuret, who is implied to be royalty like him, though from another nation. Just like Noctis, Stella is shown to be able to fight by materializing weapons out of thin air. Noctis and Stella seem reluctant to fight each other and her exact affiliation with him is unknown. The two of them talk about how they are both able to "see the light", implying that they have similar powers. Noctis is shy but hides it by acting cool, while Stella seems to have had a much better upbringing.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Combat</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/99864/2507753-7717677859-FFXV_.png" data-ref-id="1300-2507753" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/99864/2507753-7717677859-FFXV_.png" data-ref-id="1300-2507753"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Gladiolus shields Noctis from an enemy monster" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/9/99864/2507753-7717677859-FFXV_.png"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/9/99864/2507753-7717677859-FFXV_.png" alt="Gladiolus shields Noctis from an enemy monster"></noscript></a><figcaption>Gladiolus shields Noctis from an enemy monster</figcaption></figure><p>The player has direct control over one character, Noctis, with assistance from AI companion party members. Party members can also team up for more powerful attacks.</p><p>In early iterations of the game, the game would <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/party-leader-dies-game-over/3015-6548/" data-ref-id="3015-6548">end immediately if Noctis died in battle</a>, though that may change for the final version.</p><h3>Transportation</h3><p>The primary mode of travel around the game's world is a car. Though the player can exit the car and explore the world on foot, the world is large enough that foot travel between destinations isn't practical. The player is able to drive the car manually, or can set driving to automatic. When driving being automatically controlled by the game, the player can still look around the world for secrets.</p><h3>Teleportation Power</h3><p>Noctis has a special teleportation ability that allows him to warp between select points in the environment. When a cursor highlights a visible location that Noctis can warp to, the player can make him teleport to that spot.</p><h2>Development</h2><p>Final Fantasy XV was first announced under the name of Final Fantasy Versus XIII in 2006. Helmed by <a href="/tetsuya-nomura/3040-637/" data-ref-id="3040-637">Tetsuya Nomura</a>, the intent was to create an <a href="/action-rpg/3015-8592/" data-ref-id="3015-8592">action RPG</a> in the vein of <a href="/kingdom-hearts/3025-414/" data-ref-id="3025-414">Kingdom Hearts</a>, but with a more mature tone and story. The game's title "Versus XIII" was meant to reference a number of elements, such as the game's darker tone and setting that play in opposition to the tone and setting of <a href="/final-fantasy-xiii/3030-20664/" data-ref-id="3030-20664">Final Fantasy XIII</a>. Versus XIII was developed as a part of the <a href="/fabula-nova-crystallis/3025-612/" data-ref-id="3025-612">Fabula Nova Crystallis</a> project, along with Final Fantasy XIII and <a href="/final-fantasy-type-0/3030-21848/" data-ref-id="3030-21848">Final Fantasy Type-0</a> (originally entitled Final Fantasy Agito XIII), and shares elements of the same fictional mythology from which the other games take their own.</p><p>After years of protracted development, Square Enix unveiled a new trailer for Versus XIII at <a href="/e3-2013/3015-7534/" data-ref-id="3015-7534">E3 2013</a>, where it was first revealed that the game had become Final Fantasy XV. The following year, at <a href="/tokyo-game-show-2014/3015-8511/" data-ref-id="3015-8511">TGS 2014</a>, Square Enix announced that Nomura had shifted off of the project to focus on <a href="/kingdom-hearts-iii/3030-42926/" data-ref-id="3030-42926">Kingdom Hearts III</a>, and that Final Fantasy Type-0 director <a href="/hajime-tabata/3040-94186/" data-ref-id="3040-94186">Hajime Tabata</a> is now overseeing the game's development. Tabata originally joined the Final Fantasy XV team as co-director in 2012, after which the game began its transition from Versus XIII to XV and development was moved to newer console platforms. Additionally, the three core gameplay, engine, and cinematics teams that had been working separately on Versus XIII, were merged for better collaboration. As of TGS 2014, the Final Fantasy XV team was around three hundred people.</p><h3>Luminous Studio Engine</h3><p>The game is running on Square Enix's <a href="/luminous-engine/3015-7696/" data-ref-id="3015-7696">Luminous Studio</a> graphics engine. The demo will be using version 1.5 of the engine, while the final game will be using version 2.0 of the engine. It will be running at 1080p with 30 frames per second. Compared to the 20,000 polygons used for the <a href="/fabula-nova-crystallis/3025-612/" data-ref-id="3025-612">Final Fantasy XIII</a> characters, Final Fantasy XV will be using 100,000 polygons for its characters (around the same as <a href="/the-order-1886/3030-42922/" data-ref-id="3030-42922">The Order: 1886</a>, <a href="/uncharted-4-a-thiefs-end/3030-44507/" data-ref-id="3030-44507">Uncharted 4</a>, and <a href="/star-citizen/3030-40011/" data-ref-id="3030-40011">Star Citizen</a>, but slightly less than <a href="/ninja-gaiden-3-razors-edge/3030-39749/" data-ref-id="3030-39749">Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge</a> and <a href="/infamous-second-son/3030-41695/" data-ref-id="3030-41695">inFamous: Second Son</a>). Overall, Final Fantasy XV will be using 5 million polygons per frame, pushing 150 million polygons per second. [<a href="http://attackofthefanboy.com/news/final-fantasy-xvs-graphics-explained-detail/" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">ref</a>] This is one of the highest polygon counts known for a video game.</p><p>Each character model will be using 20,000 to 30,000 polygons just for the hair alone, [<a href="http://forum.reallusion.com/Topic223714-13-1.aspx" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">ref</a>] more than any other video game, and the same as the polygon count for an entire Final Fantasy XIII character.

Final Fantasy XV also uses 30 MB textures for each character [<a href="http://sqex.info/ffxv-luminous-studios-developer-interviews-part-1/" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">ref</a>] (in comparison, inFamous: Second Son uses up to 28 MB for a character).</p><p>Comparison screenshots between Final Fantasy XV's real-time gameplay and <a href="/full-motion-video/3015-604/" data-ref-id="3015-604">pre-rendered CGI</a> appear to show the real-time gameplay graphics screenshot coming close to the quality of the pre-rendered CGI screenshot.

The Final Fantasy XV: Episode Duscae demo will cover 3 square kilometers, a small part of the Duscae region.</p><h2>Demo</h2><p>Vouchers for a Final Fantasy XV demo were included with purchases of <a href="/final-fantasy-type0-hd/3030-47854/" data-ref-id="3030-47854">Final Fantasy Type-0 HD</a> when the game was released on March 17, 2015. The demo released on March 20, 2015 called Final Fantasy XV: Episode Duscae. The demo is taken from an early portion of the full game with some differences; the name "Duscae" is taken from a location in the game's world. The developers were aiming to allow the demo to be completed in an hour, but it could contain enough optional content to explore to extend to three hours. </p><p>Another demo, Platinum Demo -  Final Fantasy XV, was released on March 31, 2016 following the Uncovered: Final Fantasy XV event. The demo contains content that isn't in the main game and follows a young Noctis as he journeys through a dream. </p><h2>Useful Links</h2><ul><li><a href="http://www.jp.square-enix.com/ff15/" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">Official Final Fantasy XV Website (Japan)</a></li><li><a href="http://archive.na.square-enix.com/FFXV/" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">Official Final Fantasy XV Website (North America and Europe)</a></li></ul>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p>DC Universe Online was announced at Sony's <a href="../../e3-2008/92-3499/" rel="nofollow">E3 2008</a> press conference. It is an MMORPG in which you create your own superhero and roam the streets of well known DC Comics locations, including <a href="../../gotham-city/95-111/" rel="nofollow">Gotham Cit</a>y and <a href="../../metropolis/95-114/" rel="nofollow">Metropolis</a>. World renowned comic book artist <a href="../../jim-lee/72-89281/" rel="nofollow">Jim Lee</a> was the one who unveiled the game and is involved heavily in the development process. In the game you will be able to fight along side famous DC heroes and villains such as <a href="/batman/3005-66/" data-ref-id="3005-66">Batman</a>, <a href="/superman/3005-47/" data-ref-id="3005-47">Superman</a> and <a href="/wonder-woman/3005-2301/" data-ref-id="3005-2301">Wonder Woman</a>, <a href="/lex-luthor/3005-6225/" data-ref-id="3005-6225">Lex Luthor</a>, <a href="/circe/3005-9864/" data-ref-id="3005-9864">Circe</a> and the <a href="/the-joker/3005-952/" data-ref-id="3005-952">Joker</a> and enter well known comic book locations. The game has separate servers for both <a href="../../pc/60-94/" rel="nofollow">PC</a> and <a href="../../playstation-3/60-35/" rel="nofollow">PS3</a>.</p><h2><b>Plot</b></h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48227/1667347-the_flash_character_joins_dc_universe_online_cast.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1667347" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.63548387096774" data-width="480" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:63.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48227/1667347-the_flash_character_joins_dc_universe_online_cast.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1667347"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/48227/1667347-the_flash_character_joins_dc_universe_online_cast.jpg" alt="1667347-the_flash_character_joins_dc_universe_online_cast.jpg"></a></figure><p>In the future, Lex Luthor finally triumphs over the Justice League, killing Superman after a massive battle that destroys most of Metropolis and numerous other meta-humans. However, his success was thanks largely to the machinations of Braniac, who had slowly been draining Earth's protectors of their powers, and eventually conquers all of Earth.</p><p>Future Lex time-travels to the present, and tells the still intact Justice League the fate of their planet, and his plan to avert it: by releasing nanites created from the powers of the heroes in the future by Braniac. Future Lex infects much of the population of Earth with new superpowers to swell the ranks of meta-humans for the coming Brainiac invasion.</p><p>As one of the new superheroes (or villains), you escape Brainiac's harvester ships with the help of either Oracle and Superman or Calculator and Lex Luthor, and go on to be mentored in the ways of justice or evil.</p><p>If you choose to be a hero, your mentor will be either Superman, Wonder Woman, or Batman. For the villain side, your mentor will be Lex Luthor, Circe, or the Joker. You will also begin the game in your mentor's respective home turf (eg Metropolis if Superman or Lex), where the battle between good and evil, heightened by the influx of new Metas, rages on every street corner.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2748/272615-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-272615" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2748/272615-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-272615"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2748/272615-2.jpg" alt="Not only can objects be thrown and used as melee weapons, but also they can be charged up and even deflected."></a><figcaption>Not only can objects be thrown and used as melee weapons, but also they can be charged up and even deflected.</figcaption></figure><p>The gameplay is more action oriented than most MMORPGs. You begin with selecting your character's customized stats and look. You can then choose your super power like fire, lightning, etc. You can then chose your power source (for example your fists if it's a Batman-like character or a bow and arrow for a Green Arrow type character) and your movement style like super speed, flight, acrobatics, etc. Combined with traits like super strength or metabolism, you can mix and match many of these gameplay choices and create any type of superhero you want (weapons are also available for your character but are based on whether they are ranged or close-quarter combat items). You get different abilities as you level up like in most traditional MMORPGs (the two types of points that you invest in your character's abilities are skill points and power points). The more you invest towards your hero/villain's skill will cause the effectiveness of that skill to increase (telekinesis for example has a greater range and damage as it is upgraded). Depending on the skills you have, you can climb walls, run fast, jump really high, etc. There are no classes in the game because every aspect of the character is customizable and because superheroes are very adaptable (in the game you can change from an offensive role to defensive role on the fly, affecting the abilities you have). One ability might be used to deal damage but when switched to defensive mode that power is used to knock opponents down.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/899387-dc_scr_env_metro_0041.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-899387" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.5634765625" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/899387-dc_scr_env_metro_0041.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-899387"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Places from the DC Universe, like Metropolis, will be fully explorable right down to the Daily Planet." class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/19745/899387-dc_scr_env_metro_0041.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/19745/899387-dc_scr_env_metro_0041.jpg" alt="Places from the DC Universe, like Metropolis, will be fully explorable right down to the Daily Planet."></noscript></a><figcaption>Places from the DC Universe, like Metropolis, will be fully explorable right down to the Daily Planet.</figcaption></figure><p>It seems that instead of the traditional "Quests" you have "cases". This is where you must provide a wide range of help to the other legendary superheroes like Superman or Batman. For example, Batman may call you on your communicator to meet him at the docks for help. Also, he will be disappointed and make a remark pertaining to your absence if you didn't show up. You will have a relationship with these characters and they will respond accordingly to your actions and choices. Another example of a case would be that you arrive in Metropolis, one of the fully fleshed and explorable cities/areas in the game, where you must prevent Doomsday from escaping after a huge fight with Superman. Your case would be to stop Lex Luthor's forces from obtaining some of the blood that spilled during the battle. You will be in contact with these superheroes throughout your career. If you play as the villain you will get "Capers" where you work for the villians. So you will actually be fighting other players who are working for the superheroes on the same mission objectives.</p><p>The action is not turn based or random; it's all 100% responsive to your button commands like a standard action game.</p><p>There is no death in the game, just Knockouts. Instead you can choose to rally back into the fight or withdraw. You can revive unconscious NPCs and other players so that they can help you if and/or when the need arises.</p><h3>Powers</h3><p>Players are given the option to setup the powers of their superhero during the initial creation of their character. Powers basically determine what kind of combat abilities they will have and their specific role type. Within each powers skill tree, players have two paths to allocate their points. Powers are currently broken up into:</p><p><b><u>Fire</u></b></p><ul><li>Immolation</li><li>Ignition</li></ul><p><b><u>Ice</u></b></p><ul><li>Cryogenics</li><li>Storm</li></ul><p><b><u>Mental</u></b></p><ul><li>Telekinesis</li><li>Illusion</li></ul><p><b><u>Nature</u></b></p><ul><li>Shape shifting</li><li>Plants</li></ul><p><b><u>Sorcery</u></b></p><ul><li>Summoning</li><li>Destiny</li></ul><p><b><u>Gadgets</u></b></p><ul><li>Tricks</li><li>Traps</li></ul><p><b><u>Light</u></b></p><ul><li>Support</li><li>Assault</li></ul><p><b><u>Electricity</u></b></p><ul><li>Voltage</li><li>Amperage</li></ul><p><b><u>Earth</u></b></p><ul><li>Geokinesis</li><li>Seismic</li></ul><p><b><u>Quantum</u></b></p><ul><li>Time</li><li>Space</li></ul><h3>Weapons</h3><p>Weapons determine your basic form of combat. Depending on what type of weapons you choose will determine if your character deals damage up close or from a far. At first players are only allowed to choose one type of weapon skill to learn but after they reach level 10 they can choose from the others available.</p><p>At the moment the weapon types are:</p><ul><li>One-Handed</li><li>Two-Handed</li><li>Hand Blaster</li><li>Bow</li><li>Brawling</li><li>Dual Pistols</li><li>Dual Wield</li><li>Martial Arts</li><li>Rifle</li><li>Staff</li></ul><h2>Pricing</h2><p>The <a href="../../playstation-3/60-35/" rel="nofollow">PS3</a> version of the game originally retailed for $59.99 while the <a href="../../pc/60-94/" rel="nofollow">PC</a> version originally retailed for $49.99. Both versions come with one free month of play time. The game originally followed the standard a $15/month subscription-based model until October 2011 when a free-to-play model was unveiled.

The Legendary subscription will retain the $15 a month fee but grants all current and future DLC at no additional cost, more than 15 character slots, more than 80 inventory slots, the ability to form leagues without any size restrictions, and more.</p><h2>DLC Packs</h2><h3>Fight for the Light</h3><p>The first DLC pack released on September 6, 2011.

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/257/177268-flower_5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-177268" data-size="medium" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/257/177268-flower_5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-177268"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/257/177268-flower_5.jpg" alt="You'll never want for beautifully rendered grass again"></a><figcaption>You'll never want for beautifully rendered grass again</figcaption></figure><p>Flower is <a data-ref-id="3010-5521" href="/thatgamecompany/3010-5521/">thatgamecompany</a>'s second title being released via the PlayStation Network. Much like its spiritual predecessor <a data-ref-id="3030-15849" href="/flow/3030-15849/">flOw</a>, flower is much less about the gameplay than it is about a different meaning of a game.</p><p>thatgamecompany's co-founder, <a data-ref-id="3040-82903" href="/jenova-chen/3040-82903/">Jenova Chen</a>, has described it as being like "video game poetry." It is not too difficult to interpret there being an environmental message behind the game, or at least a contrast to urban living being explored. Bringing unique elements yet to be seen in this generation of consoles, flower has gained a dedicated following.</p><h3>Inspiration</h3><p>In <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9y6MYDSAww" rel="nofollow">a TED talk about "Are Video Games Art?"</a>, <a data-ref-id="3040-98025" href="/kellee-santiago/3040-98025/">Kellee Santiago</a> of <a data-ref-id="3010-5521" href="/thatgamecompany/3010-5521/">thatgamecompany</a>, said the game was "<strong>an expression of director,</strong> <a data-ref-id="3040-82903" href="/jenova-chen/3040-82903/"><strong>Jenova Chen</strong></a><strong>, who moved from the extremely metropolitan area of Shanghai, China to the relatively more rural area of California. He was just amazed at these huge rolling landscapes, and yet he found over time, he started to miss those elements of the city he grew up with. And so although it starts in these very open, clean environments; as the player goes through the game, they realise it's about trying to find a harmony or balance between the elements of urban and the natural</strong>."</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Essentially, the player controls the wind. The gameplay involves guiding a stream of petals around various landscapes in which you will be able to interact with the flowers there in some way, depending on the particular level. All motion in the game is designed to be controlled using the SIXAXIS functionality of the <a data-ref-id="3045-35" href="/playstation-3/3045-35/">PlayStation 3</a> controller. The creators are trying to immerse the player in another experience when playing flower, which they are trying to achieve by the use of stunning visuals complemented by a soothing musical score, and with the field of vision in the game being wider than in most games to better mimic a human's peripheral vision and depth perception. The visual fidelity of Flower is in large part due to the game being able to render and simulate 200,000 blades of grass on-screen at any one time, surely allowing it to claim the coveted boast of the 'best grass in video games...ever'. The only use of the buttons in gameplay is holding any button to accelerate.</p><h3>Hidden/Secret Flowers</h3><p>Each level contains three groups of secret flowers, some of which are activated by blooming certain flowers in a particular area and others are hidden from the path the game leads you through. Each batch collected leaves a seed in the pot of your flower in the menu upon completion of the level. Each seed you collect will also make your flower at the menu open up to a more full bloom. Obtaining all three secret flower groups for all six levels will grant you the Dream gold trophy, which will also change the default view from the apartment, this view replaces the urban environment with a sunny field in the foreground and a grassy hill in the background. This is thought to show that the flowers' dream has come true.</p><h2>Level design</h2><p>It would seem that the main menu in flower, from which each level is loaded, is based around an urban apartment. The different levels are said to be the 'dreams' of different flowers that are represented in this apartment. The flowers appear in the following order when all the levels are unlocked: Pink, Red, Yellow, Blue, Purple, White. Every single flower level adds something unique or introduces a new type of flower.</p><h3>Pink Flower</h3><p>Gazing into this flower opens a wind based level. Players are introduced to the blue flowers which make wind blow to power up the many windmills. Afterwords player traverse a canyon until they gain more speed and end up powering more windmills.</p><h3>Red Flower</h3><p>This is the second level you unlock. It is a color based level that starts in sepia tones. When you unleash the power of the red flowers color starts popping into the world. In the final area you can gain the power to color grass by touching different stones.</p><h3>Yellow Flower</h3><p>The first level focuses on introducing the basic flower mechanics. Grabbing yellow flowers makes red flowers spawn, and red flowers renew and reinvigorate the area around them turning it green and filled with life.</p><h3>Blue Flower</h3><p>Using windmills to create electricity and illuminate the ground at nighttime is the new mechanic presented here. Here you are able to "charge" electrically the petals that follow you and transmit electricity from lamp post to lamp post until you finish the level.</p><h3>Purple Flower</h3><p>The dreariest level in the game, you must reach the end while nullifying the threatening electrical power grids, that can burn you and hurt you. Culminates with a dash and dodging of falling debris and is apparently directly connected to the final level.</p><h3>White Flower</h3><p>This is the final level, the new mechanic introduced is renovating the world, at the beginning the petals become super charged similar to when you could color the grass in the red color level. You now have the power to eliminate the corruption in the city, and renovate it and repaint it into a vibrant and beautiful place once more.</p><p>Each dream/level is based on an aspect of urban life with flower presumably showing a contrast to that within the level. So, for example, one level will be based on color, with the game world initially starting out as desaturated and gray like in most urban landscapes, but with progressively more color coming into the landscape as you interact with it. There are six levels in total, plus the credits level.</p><h2>Awards</h2><p>In addition to being critically well received, flower won numerous awards including</p><ul><li>Best Indie Game - Playboy</li><li>Best Original Soundtrack - X-Play</li><li>Best Independent Game of the Year - SpikeTV Video Game Awards</li><li>Best Downloadable Game of the Year - TheSixthAxis</li><li>Download Game of the Year - 1UP</li><li><a data-ref-id="3015-3244" href="/e3-2009/3015-3244/">E3</a> Gold Award - <a data-ref-id="3010-3694" href="/gamepro/3010-3694/">GamePro</a></li><li>Best Downloadable Game - GameSpy</li><li>PS3 Special Achievement for Innovation - IGN</li><li>Best Original Game - UGO</li><li>Casual Game of the Year - AIAS</li><li>Oh, and <a data-ref-id="3040-44184" href="/david-jaffe/3040-44184/">David Jaffe</a> called flower his Game of the Year.

It was released exclusively for the <a href="../../playstation-3/60-35/" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 3</a> on February 23rd, 2010. Director and Quantic Dream founder <a href="../../david-cage/72-20744/" rel="nofollow">David Cage</a> has described the game as a "very dark film <a href="/film-noir/3015-1732/" data-ref-id="3015-1732">noir</a> thriller with mature themes". The game centers around four playable characters as they each attempt to track down the Origami Killer. Each character has their own motivations which are explored throughout the game's dark and emotional storyline.</p><p>The gameplay in Heavy Rain has a unique blend of exploration, dynamic quick-time events, dialogue and evidence analysis. The game's control scheme is unique in that each button performs different actions in different situations, which are conveyed to the player through on-screen prompts.</p><p>Heavy Rain enabled <a href="/playstation-move/3015-4669/" data-ref-id="3015-4669">PlayStation Move</a> support in October 2010.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>Someone is <a href="../../murder/92-1654/" rel="nofollow">murdering children</a>, seemingly at random. This murderer leaves an <a href="../../origami/93-554/" rel="nofollow">origami</a> crane in the palm of each victim's hand, and becomes known as "The Origami Killer". In addition to the cranes, the Origami Killer also covers their victim's faces with mud and leaves an orchid on their chest. All of the victims had been drowned before the killer moved the bodies. Players control four main characters to investigate and figure out who is committing these atrocities.</p><h3>Norman Jayden</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/1034379-06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1034379" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/1034379-06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1034379"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14036/1034379-06.jpg" alt="Norman Jayden"></a><figcaption>Norman Jayden</figcaption></figure><p><a href="../../norman-jayden/94-11660/" rel="nofollow">Norman Jayden</a> is a criminal profiler for the <a href="../../agents/92-2906/" rel="nofollow">FBI</a> with additional expertise in the forensics field. He is sent to help the local police by doing a profile of the Origami Killer, but soon starts investigating the cases on his own using the hi-tech gadget ARI (Added Reality Interface) - much to the chagrin of several members of the local PD who do not like him interfering with their business. In the demo of Heavy Rain, Norman investigates a murder scene at a railway line. His investigation leads him to believe that the body was dumped by the Origami Killer. Jayden is addicted to the fictional drug Triptocaine, which plays a significant role in his part of the game. He experiences many symptoms (severe tremors, dizziness and nosebleeds) that are assumed to be related to withdrawal, but the game never really clarifies what they are from.</p><h3>Ethan Mars</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/1110366-screen003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1110366" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/1110366-screen003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1110366"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Ethan Mars" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14036/1110366-screen003.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14036/1110366-screen003.jpg" alt="Ethan Mars"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ethan Mars</figcaption></figure><p><a href="../../ethan-mars/94-12115/" rel="nofollow">Ethan Mars</a> is a happily married architect and father of two sons, Jason and Shaun. Jason wanders off in a crowded mall after his 10th birthday party and ends up dying in a freak accident. This causes Ethan to suffer a mental breakdown, leading to the destruction of his marriage and distancing him from his other son. Later, when Shaun disappears and is thought to be the latest victim of the Origami Killer, Ethan has to go through a series of painful challenges laid out by the killer to test "how far he is willing to go to save his son".</p><h3>Scott Shelby</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/1118551-933123_20090825_screen003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1118551" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/1118551-933123_20090825_screen003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1118551"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Scott Shelby" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14036/1118551-933123_20090825_screen003.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14036/1118551-933123_20090825_screen003.jpg" alt="Scott Shelby"></noscript></a><figcaption>Scott Shelby</figcaption></figure><p>An asthmatic, overweight ex-cop deceptively in his mid-40's, <a href="../../scott-shelby/94-12114/" rel="nofollow">Scott Shelby</a>, works as a private detective.

Suffering from insomnia, she frequently visits a motel in order to fall asleep. Here she meets Ethan, and is suddenly pulled into the case of the Origami Killer. At first she sees the potential for a great story, but the longer she is with Ethan, the more emotionally invested she becomes.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Although Heavy Rain may seem like a <a href="../../dragons-lair/61-23/" rel="nofollow">Dragon's Lair</a> type of game, the developers have expressly stated that control of the character is rarely taken away from the player. The player often has direct control of the character, and can walk around at will within a set area using the R2 Button and Left Analog Stick. There are almost no <a href="../../in-engine-cinematic/92-964/" rel="nofollow">cinematics</a> to watch. There is an investigation portion to the game - mainly when <a href="../../norman-jayden/94-11660/" rel="nofollow">Jayden</a> uses ARI at crime scenes - where the player can freely search anywhere they think they might find a hidden clue. There is another portion of the game that uses <a href="../../quick-time-event/92-6/" rel="nofollow">QTE</a>s, mostly during fast paced action sequences, to create immersion. The QTEs, however, are not static images prompting button presses, but rather are worked into the environment. At times, multiple buttons will appear on screen allowing you to choose from a number of events whose outcome is felt immediately. The <a href="///">QTE</a>s use every button on the PS3 controller (except L3, R3, the D-pad and obviously the Start and Select buttons) as well as its <a href="/sixaxis-support/3015-5310/" data-ref-id="3015-5310">SIXAXIS</a> functionality. At certain points in the game, the player is required to press a succession of buttons, holding down the previous button(s) as they press the next - these combinations are often constructed in such a way that the difficulty of what the character is trying to achieve corresponds with the physical difficulty of pressing the correct buttons (meaning that a QTE for crawling through live electricity will be much harder than a QTE for going up a hill).</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14036/1034381-07.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1034381" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14036/1034381-07.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1034381"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt=""Can you stop that thing?"" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14036/1034381-07.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14036/1034381-07.jpg" alt=""></noscript></a><figcaption>"Can you stop that thing?"</figcaption></figure><p><a href="../../dialogue-trees/92-77/" rel="nofollow">Dialogue trees</a> are used heavily in the games, represented by words encircling the player. The state of the words will correspond to the character's mental state - if they are in a state of panic the words can be shaking violently, making them difficult to read. The same applies to the 'thought mechanic' where by pressing L2 at any time, a 'dialogue tree' will show what thoughts are going through that character's mind.</p><p>There is no <a href="../../game-over/92-372/" rel="nofollow">game over</a> screen, as the game continues to take into account whatever actions occur regardless of how drastically they affect the characters. If a character you control dies, then he or she will remain dead and the investigation will continue from another character's perspective. If all characters die, the plot line will still continue without the impact that those characters could have made.</p><h2>Development</h2><p>Development of Heavy Rain began in February of 2006 and was announced at <a href="../../e3-2006/92-3439/" rel="nofollow">E3</a> <a href="../../e3-2006/92-3439/" rel="nofollow">2006</a>, at which it was a tech demo called "The Casting". The game was originally for PC and there were to be two separate releases of the game - one for computers equipped with the appropriate physics processing unit and one for computers that didn't meet the specification. Some of the physics relied on <a href="../../physx/92-1923/" rel="nofollow">PhysX</a>. The E3 demo made use of <a href="../../ageia-technologies-inc/65-4701/" rel="nofollow">AGEIA</a> technology.</p><p>Noteworthy features of "The Casting" were full body motion capture along with full facial motion capture, wrinkles on faces, real time tears, advanced rendering features, and advanced skin shaders. The demo showed technology enabling pupil dilation and dynamic hair with physics. The game engine supports full real time post-processing. The facial motion capture was captured using a Vicon MX40 camera with an enhanced muscle system.</p><h2>Deleted Content</h2><p>During the game's development, the story had many supernatural elements. Scott and Ethan were supposed to share a mental bond that caused Ethan's blackout. Scott was also seen smothering his mother with a pillow. However, these were cut from the final version because they were not deemed suitable.</p><h2>Heavy Rain Chronicles - DLC</h2><p>Quantic Dream founder David Cage said 2009 in an Interview with VideoGamer.com that "<i>.. we are talking with Sony at the moment about having maybe extra downloadable content, maybe with prequels or sequels about the characters.</i>"</p><p>Later it was revealed that the DLC would be episodes of the so-called Heavy Rain Chronicles.</p><p><u><b>Different Plans for DLC, revealed during various Interviews:</b></u></p><p>- <a href="///">The Taxidermist</a> (at first only available with a preorder code, later through PSN purchase - released on April 1, 2010)</p><p>- DLC with a focus on Norman Jayden and how he got addicted to drugs;</p><p>- Another episode with you taking the role of the "villain";</p><p>On July 2010 Cage revealed in an Interview with Eurogamer.com on subject of the Chronicles that "<i>.. they are on hold to allow the team to work on Move and on new projects, and I doubt they will ever be produced.</i>"</p><h2>PlayStation Move Version</h2><p>In Winter 2010, a new version of the game was released, Heavy Rain Move Edition. This version of the game integrates the <a href="/playstation-move/3000-36/" data-ref-id="3000-36">PlayStation Move</a> controller into the game, allowing full motion control of the characters' actions. Older versions of the game can be patched with a free download to integrate these Move controls. Heavy Rain Move Edition is fully playable with standard controller.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p><b>Heavy Rain</b>'s soundtrack was composed by <a href="/normand-corbeil/3040-98308/" data-ref-id="3040-98308">Normand Corbeil</a> and recorded at the Abbey Road Studios in London. It was made available on the iTunes Store on 23 February, 2010 and on the PlayStation Network on 4 March, 2010.</p><ol><li>Ethan Mars' Main Theme (3:31)</li><li>Norman Jayden's Main Theme (4:42)</li><li>Before the Storm (2:55)</li><li>Madison Paige's Main Theme (3:31)</li><li>Scott Shelby's Main Theme (6:01)</li><li>Lauren Winter's Main Theme (3:07)</li><li>Painful Memories (1:29)</li><li>The Chase (1:25)</li><li>Redemption (1:39)</li><li>The Bulldozer (1:34)</li><li>High Tension (1:16)</li><li>The Fight (1:31)</li><li>The Hold Up (1:28)</li><li>Looking for Shaun (1:36)</li><li>Countdown (1:33)</li><li>Last Breath (2:59)</li></ol>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p>Unveiled via press release in February 2008, the follow-up to the Marvel Ultimate Alliance was originally titled Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2: Fusion. However, after a while, the Fusion subtitle was dropped and shortened simply to Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19306/1294306-marvel_ultimate_alliance_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1294306" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.55666666666667" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:55.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19306/1294306-marvel_ultimate_alliance_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1294306"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/19306/1294306-marvel_ultimate_alliance_2.jpg" alt="1294306-marvel_ultimate_alliance_2.jpg"></a></figure><p>The story of Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 takes its inspiration from a couple of actual story arcs that occurred in Marvel Comics, namely <a href="http://www.comicvine.com/secret-war/39-54398/">Secret War</a> and <a href="http://www.comicvine.com/civil-war/39-40615/">Civil War</a>. Some of the details of the story arcs have been either changed or rearranged in order to work as a cohesive story in the video game.</p><p>The game starts with Captain America, Iron Man, Spider-Man, and Wolverine as the default playable characters. As the group of heroes are led by Nick Fury, they are seen in an early cutscene infiltrating Latveria in an effort to unravel a conspiracy involving Lucia Von Bardas, the new Latverian ruler. Nick Fury and the other heroes eventually discover that The Tinkerer has been developing tech for many other countries while being funded by Latveria, leading to the ideals of international super-terrorism. The President of the United States is against the idea of any attack on Latveria, as von Bardas has been making friendly ties with the U.S. Regardless of this, Nick Fury and the crew go through with their attack and lay waste to Castle Doom, which also leads to the belief that Lucia Von Bardas died in the attack. Some years later, Lucia Von Bardas ends up reappearing with cyborg-like body parts, and she ends up controlling a ship that begins to use its weaponry to wreak havoc and destruction on New York City. A group of heroes (of the player's choosing) must then fight and defeat Lucia Von Bardas. In the wake of the destruction, the world begins to question the morality and necessity of superheroes being able to unleash their own brand of justice without having any form of accountability.</p><p>As some time has passed, the world seems to be pulling back its paranoia a little bit after the events of Secret War, especially since Nick Fury has disappeared from the public eye and stepped away from his head position at S.H.I.E.L.D. Tony Stark (Iron Man) is seen in his penthouse watching the T.V. while worrying about fighting off a new federal bill called the Superhuman Registration Act, which would force all mutants and superheroes to register with the federal government. As he watches a reality show that has been created by the group The New Warriors, Tony and the world witness on live television as Nitro causes a massive explosion that kills hundreds to thousands of people, including an elementary school of children. This forces the hand of the federal government in passing the Superhuman Registration Act.</p><p>Maria Hill, the current leader of S.H.I.E.L.D., asks Captain America to meet with her. She asks him to help round up all of the superheroes and convince them to register. Captain America sees this as a violation of his freedom, and when he refuses, Hill tries to have him put down by her security. Captain America runs for a window, jumps out, and lands on a airplane that flies him away. This leads to Captain America being denounced by the President as a vigilante and criminal. In the meantime, Iron Man decides that he will try to have the act smashed before it gets to legislative hands by going to the White House and speaking in protest to the bill. However, when he and others superheroes arrive at the White House, they find out that it is under siege by Titanium Man.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19306/1294308-marvel_ultimate_alliance_2_hands_on_preview.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1294308" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.56333333333333" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19306/1294308-marvel_ultimate_alliance_2_hands_on_preview.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1294308"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/19306/1294308-marvel_ultimate_alliance_2_hands_on_preview.jpg" alt="Which side are you on?"></a><figcaption>Which side are you on?</figcaption></figure><p>In the aftermatch, Iron Man and Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic) that registering might be the best thing that anyone with powers and abilities can do. Meanwhile, Captain America and Luke Cage decide that registering would be the worst possible solution for innocent people who cannot defend themselves, as well as a violation of their rights. These events form two distinct sides: Pro-Registration (led by Iron Man) and Anti-Registration (led by Captain America).</p><p>Pro-Reg starts hunting down any Anti-Reg mutants and superhumans, which includes the likes of Luke Cage, Wolverine, and Daredevil. Some superhero teams, such as the Fantastic Four, start seeing tensions rise between members because of the actions that each team participate in. While these hunts are occurring, the Pro-Reg side also has the likes of Hank Pym and Reed Richards working on a form of nanite that can be used to control any mutants and superhumans in case they decide to misuse their powers.</p><p>Eventually, Tony Stark sets up a fake hostage situation at Stark Industries as an ambush attempt to round up a large number of Anti-Regs. He offers Captain America and anyone else who joins amnesty, but a battle then ensues. During this battle, the nanites located in some of the mutants/supervillains end up having the opposite effect than expected, leading to Venom and Green Goblin attacking S.H.I.E.L.D. officers and trying to destroy the facility. Luckily for the Anti-Reg team, one of the S.H.I.E.L.D. soldiers is Nick Fury, and he asks for help in disarming the bombs. The team ends up finding out that who they thought was Nick Fury was merely one of Nick's android versions. Nick informs them that they need to break into the Negative Zone and steal a sample of the nanite formula in order to stop the continued spreading of nanites worldwide. When they find the sample, Nick hits the self-destruct mechanism to prevent any more nanites from getting out, and the team leaves him behind. At this point, the Superhuman Registration Act is suspended so the teams can unite and fight this new threat.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19306/1294310-mua2_2291.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1294310" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.55862068965517" data-width="290" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 290px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:55.9%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19306/1294310-mua2_2291.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1294310"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Yeah, there's a block puzzle or two..." class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/19306/1294310-mua2_2291.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/19306/1294310-mua2_2291.jpg" alt="Yeah, there's a block puzzle or two..."></noscript></a><figcaption>Yeah, there's a block puzzle or two...</figcaption></figure><p>After relocating to the Black Panther's home of Wakanda, which is also a safe place from any nanite attacks, the team finds out that the nanite-controlled superhumans and mutants have formed as a collective known as The Fold. As The Fold tries to attack Wakanda, the team helps Black Panther and Storm defend the country. The team finds out that in order to stop the nanite attacks, they need to broadcast a radio signal that will disable their control over mutants and superhumans. After curing Venom and Green Goblin, the team heads to Iceland to broadcast the signal. Upon arrival, they find The Tinkerer is behind the whole ordeal, and he has taken control of Nick Fury with nanites.</p><p>Once Nick Fury has been beaten, the game has two possible endings. The Anti-Registration side shows the player that the Superhuman Registration Act has been appealed, while the Pro-Registration side shows the Act being repealed.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Like its predecessor, Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 plays like a hybrid between beat 'em up and hack 'n' slash gameplay styles. At its core, the game is an RPG, featuring a leveling system and skill points for special abilities and overall character performance improvements. Players can go through the game solo with three A.I.-controlled allies, or they can play in up to four player co-op. There are also training rooms and additional "disc missions" that can be completed for additional rewards such as experience points or boosts.</p><h3>Boosts</h3><p>As players progress through the game, they will unlock different "boosts", which can be used as a means of enhancing a team's abilities. Examples are increased overall damage, increased health regeneration, additional currency drops, etc.</p><h3>Team Bonuses</h3><p>In addition to boosts, Team Bonuses return from the first Marvel Ultimate Alliance. By having four members of the same "team", you will gain an additional bonus (i.e. four characters from X-Men, the Fantastic Four, The Avengers, etc).</p><h3>Attitude</h3><p>Used primarily as a storytelling device, the "attitude" mechanic has been added to the conversations with NPCs. During a conversation, players can choose between Aggressive, Defensive, or Diplomatic responses in conversation, with different responses leading to acquiring different boosts for your team.</p><h3>Pro-Reg/Anti-Reg Specific Characters</h3><p>At a certain point in the story, the player can choose to side with Pro-Registration or Anti-Registration, which leads to changes in the story and access to exclusive characters. Iron Man, Songbird, and Mr. Fantastic are exclusive to the Pro-Reg side, and Captain America, Luke Cage and Iron Fist are exclusive to the Anti-Reg Side. There are some slight differences to the ending depending on which side you choose as well.</p><h3>Damage / Resistance Types</h3><p>Similar to the first Marvel Ultimate Alliance, knowing individual characters and bosses damage and resistance types is a must in order to staying alive and defeating bosses successfully. The known types of damage are broken down into three categories - physical damage, elemental damage, special damage. Within these three they are broken down even further into individual subsets.</p><h4>Special Damage:</h4><ul><li>Energy</li><li>Mental</li></ul><h4>Elemental Damage:</h4><ul><li>Cold</li><li>Fire</li><li>Electricity</li></ul><h4>Physical Damage:</h4><ul><li>Melee</li><li>Impact</li><li>Crushing</li><li>Wounding</li></ul><h3>Fusion System</h3><p>A big part of this game is the fusion system. Each character can combine his powers with another one to make a super powerful attack. Teaming up now becomes an essential part of the gameplay. With all of the characters being able to combine powers with one another, there will be hundreds of moves that can be used. Each move is different, some being used to clear a room quickly, some being used on only one enemy, and even the ability to revive fallen comrades. One example of these attacks is when Iron Man and Hulk combine powers, Hulk rips a hunk of rock or material from the ground, Iron Man superheats it, and then Hulk throws it at your enemies, creating an explosion.</p><h2>Confirmed Characters</h2><p><u><b>On Disc Characters</b></u></p><ul><li><a href="/captain-america/3005-1376/" data-ref-id="3005-1376">Captain America</a></li><li><a href="/daredevil/3005-2574/" data-ref-id="3005-2574">Daredevil</a></li><li><a href="/deadpool/3005-1472/" data-ref-id="3005-1472">Deadpool</a></li><li><a href="/gambit/3005-2379/" data-ref-id="3005-2379">Gambit</a></li><li><a href="/green-goblin/3005-4803/" data-ref-id="3005-4803">Green Goblin</a></li><li><a href="/the-hulk/3005-859/" data-ref-id="3005-859">Hulk</a>*</li><li><a href="/human-torch/3005-2358/" data-ref-id="3005-2358">Human Torch</a></li><li><a href="/iceman/3005-4716/" data-ref-id="3005-4716">Iceman</a></li><li><a href="/invisible-woman/3005-3498/" data-ref-id="3005-3498">Invisible Woman</a></li><li><a href="/iron-fist/3005-8678/" data-ref-id="3005-8678">Iron Fist</a></li><li><a href="/iron-man/3005-1370/" data-ref-id="3005-1370">Iron Man</a></li><li><a href="/jean-grey/3005-2424/" data-ref-id="3005-2424">Jean Grey*</a></li><li><a href="/luke-cage-power-man/3005-2385/" data-ref-id="3005-2385">Luke Cage</a></li><li><a href="/mr-fantastic/3005-4176/" data-ref-id="3005-4176">Mr. Fantastic</a></li><li><a href="/ms-marvel/3005-5538/" data-ref-id="3005-5538">Ms. Marvel</a></li><li><a href="/penance/3005-12150/" data-ref-id="3005-12150">Penance</a></li><li><a href="/songbird/3005-12461/" data-ref-id="3005-12461">Songbird</a></li><li><a href="/spider-man/3005-69/" data-ref-id="3005-69">Spider-Man</a></li><li><a href="/storm/3005-2374/" data-ref-id="3005-2374">Storm</a></li><li><a href="/the-thing/3005-2388/" data-ref-id="3005-2388">The Thing</a></li><li><a href="/thor/3005-4899/" data-ref-id="3005-4899">Thor*</a></li><li><a href="/venom/3005-932/" data-ref-id="3005-932">Venom</a></li><li><a href="/wolverine/3005-10/" data-ref-id="3005-10">Wolverine</a></li><li><a href="/nick-fury/3005-4905/" data-ref-id="3005-4905">Nick Fury</a></li></ul><p><u><b>Downloadable Content</b></u></p><ul><li><a href="/juggernaut/3005-2028/" data-ref-id="3005-2028">Juggernaut</a></li><li><a href="/carnage/3005-3162/" data-ref-id="3005-3162">Carnage</a></li><li><a href="/psylocke/3005-4396/" data-ref-id="3005-4396">Psylocke</a></li><li><a href="/cable/3005-4805/" data-ref-id="3005-4805">Cable</a></li><li><a href="/black-panther/3005-3584/" data-ref-id="3005-3584">Black Panther</a></li><li><a href="/magneto/3005-2281/" data-ref-id="3005-2281">Magneto</a></li></ul><p><u><b>Console Exclusive Characters</b></u></p><ul><li><a href="/blade/3005-2386/" data-ref-id="3005-2386">Blade</a> (Wii)</li><li><a href="/cyclops/3005-2850/" data-ref-id="3005-2850">Cyclops</a> (Wii)</li><li><a href="/iron-fist/3005-8678/" data-ref-id="3005-8678">Iron Fist</a> (360/PS3)</li><li><a href="/psylocke/3005-4396/" data-ref-id="3005-4396">Psylocke</a> (Wii)</li><li><a href="/sentry/3005-12463/" data-ref-id="3005-12463">Sentry</a> (DS)</li><li><a href="/she-hulk/3005-12462/" data-ref-id="3005-12462">She-Hulk</a> (DS)</li></ul><p>*To unlock these characters, you must find 5 of each character-specific collectible. For Hulk, it is the Gamma Regulator. For Thor, it is the Asgardian Rune. For Jean Grey, it is the M'kraan Fragment.</p><h2>Easter Eggs and Differences</h2><p>Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 features a couple of references and Easter Eggs for fans of both Marvel and the storylines it tries to portray. It also features a couple of changes made to the story, mainly Civil War, in order to make it work better as a video game.</p><p><b><u>Easter Eggs</u></b></p><ul><li>Stan Lee, co-creator of several Marvel characters and former President of Marvel Comics, makes a cameo appearance in the game. He plays the role of Senator Lieber, and he is located in a parking garage at the White House sequence of the game. Stan Lee's real name is Stanley Lieber.</li><li>During some of the news cutscenes, as well as venturing around the world, the player will hear and see references made about people believing that Tony Stark and other superheroes may be Skrulls in disguise. This is a reference to <a href="http://www.comicvine.com/secret-invasion/39-47264/">Secret Invasion</a>, the storyline that follows after Civil War. Speculation has also been made that a third MUA game could focus on this story arc because of this ongoing reference in the game. However, with Activision losing the Marvel license recently, which also eliminated the DLC* on both the XBL and PSN services, it seems exceedingly unlikely.</li></ul><p>*On July 1 2010, the DLC was made available once again and will remain so only until Dec 31 2010.</p><p><b><u>Differences</u></b></p><ul><li>In Civil War, the battle at Stark Industries plays out quite differently than it does in the game, and this is where the story for the game veers into quite a different direction. In the comics, Black Goliath is killed by a Thor clone at the battle. This causes the sides to shift significantly and sees characters like Sue Storm (Invisible Woman), Johnny Storm (The Human Torch), and Spider-Man joining the Anti-Reg team.</li><li>In Civil War, there is a very important part played by The Punisher for the Anti-Reg team, where The Punisher kills two former super-villains who are trying to help the Anti-Reg team. Captain America goes into a rage and tells The Punisher to leave. The Punisher was completely cut out of the story from the game, and instead, the development team worked on an interlocking story between Secret War and Civil War with Nick Fury.</li><li>In Secret War, superhuman S.H.I.E.L.D. operative Daisy Johnson is the one who specifically "kills" Lucia von Bardas. Daisy Johnson is not featured at all in the game.</li><li>The "nanite invasion" is a story specifically made for the game and is not featured in any continuity of the comics.</li></ul>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p>Final Fantasy Type-0 is an action RPG developed and published by <a href="/square-enix/3010-104/" data-ref-id="3010-104">Square Enix</a> for the <a href="/psp/3045-18/" data-ref-id="3045-18">PlayStation Portable</a>.The game was released in Japan on October 27, 2011 but due to the decline of PSP market in the West that version was never released for other territories. Director, Hajima Tabata, mentioned several times that he hoped to someday release Type-0 outside of Japan but after several years of waiting a group of fans began creating their own translation in 2013.</p><p>Lead by a Spanish hacker known as Sky, the group released their unofficial English translation on June 8, 2014. Two days afterward, Square Enix <a href="http://gematsu.com/2014/06/final-fantasy-type-0-hd-announced-ps4-xbox-one" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">announced</a> <a href="/final-fantasy-type0-hd/3030-47854/" data-ref-id="3030-47854">Final Fantasy Type-0 HD</a> an HD version of Type-0 for <a href="/playstation-4/3045-146/" data-ref-id="3045-146">PlayStation 4</a> and <a href="/xbox-one/3045-145/" data-ref-id="3045-145">Xbox One</a>, with this version being localized and released in North America and Europe (along with its companion game <a href="/final-fantasy-agito/3030-43927/" data-ref-id="3030-43927">Final Fantasy Agito</a>). On July 18, 2014 the fan translation patch was taken offline due to Square-Enix sending a cease and desist to the team.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>A TGS 2010 trailer and gameplay info the game is familiar and will feel at home to old Final Fantasy players.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/127136/1752612-queen_and_nine_fighting_a_enemy_leader_final_fantasy_type_0.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1752612" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.56666666666667" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/127136/1752612-queen_and_nine_fighting_a_enemy_leader_final_fantasy_type_0.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1752612"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/127136/1752612-queen_and_nine_fighting_a_enemy_leader_final_fantasy_type_0.jpg" alt="Queen and Nine in battle with an enemy leader."></a><figcaption>Queen and Nine in battle with an enemy leader.</figcaption></figure><p>The game is mission based, kind of like a bunch of quests and seem to be non-linear, which not a lot of Final Fantasy games do. There will also be sub-missions that can be accomplished mid-battle. The trailer also revealed that you will be able to ride <a href="/chocobo/3015-259/" data-ref-id="3015-259">chocobos</a>, like all Final Fantasy games should allow, or fly in an <a href="/airship/3055-154/" data-ref-id="3055-154">airship</a> on the world map to get around. The game seems to be the most free roam based final fantasy game that is not on of the MMO's of 11 or 14.</p><p>The <a href="/active-time-battle/3015-95/" data-ref-id="3015-95">ATB system</a> that was later altered into the ATB Kai system in <a href="/final-fantasy-x-2/3030-8985/" data-ref-id="3030-8985">Final Fantasy X-2</a> and later refined again in Crisis Core is now being refined again in Type-0 but unlike Crisis Core it will be party based. It plays like <a href="/final-fantasy-xii/3030-11497/" data-ref-id="3030-11497">Final Fantasy XII</a> as well with the fact that whoever is the leader in the party are the ones that are playable. Summons also return but they are back to Final Fantasy X status of Aeons, where the summons themselves are controllable and have their own growth and attributes. Speaking of summons, Odin has been one of the summons confirmed to be in the game thanks to an official screenshot. Looks to be summon-able by Ace. Shiva is also a confirmed summon-able aeon in the game thanks to a trailer. In battle enemies have been said to have weak points that can be targeted in battle. In this case this weak point can be used to deal a death blow to an enemy causing an <a href="/instant-kill/3015-674/" data-ref-id="3015-674">instant kill</a>.</p><p>Students of Suzaku can summon <a href="/ifrit/3005-2883/" data-ref-id="3005-2883">Ifrit</a> a popular fire summon in the final fantasy series. They can also summon Golem a rock spirit. Odin from older final fantasy games has been confirmed as one of the "War Gods."</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/127136/1784702-image64.png" data-ref-id="1300-1784702" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.56613756613757" data-width="378" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 378px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/127136/1784702-image64.png" data-ref-id="1300-1784702"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/127136/1784702-image64.png" alt="A character dying for a summon.."></a><figcaption>A character dying for a summon..</figcaption></figure><p>In Type 0 Summons are called "War Gods" but, this time around instead of expending MP, the cost of nothing or filling up a meter to summon creatures, this time around you have to sacrifice one of your own characters to bring them out.</p><p>There seems to be a list of free missions one can take for extras in the game.</p><h2>Characters</h2><h3><strong>Machina Kunagiri</strong></h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/127136/1752030-529px_ffagitoxiiicharacters.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1752030" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.7069943289225" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:70.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/127136/1752030-529px_ffagitoxiiicharacters.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1752030"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="12 main characters that were first announced." class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/127136/1752030-529px_ffagitoxiiicharacters.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/127136/1752030-529px_ffagitoxiiicharacters.jpg" alt="12 main characters that were first announced."></noscript></a><figcaption>12 main characters that were first announced.</figcaption></figure><p>A black haired young male, that uses 2 Volt <a href="/">rapiers</a> in battle. Machina can easily rack up a 10 hit combo with his sabers, including his Spin Drive ability that damages enemies within a radius.</p><h3><strong>Rem</strong> <b>Tokimiya</b></h3><p>A brown haired young woman that uses a pair of dual daggers in battle and can also cast magic like the others. Rem uses a mix of strikes and magic in battle with her daggers. Her special attack, Aspir Venom, does damages from enemies and saps them of their <a href="/mp/3015-762/" data-ref-id="3015-762">MP</a>.</p><p>Machina and Rem are said to be the main protagonists of the game.</p><h3><b>Ace</b></h3><p>Like the Aces in playing cards, he was originally going to be named just "Card" but since the entire cast is now based around playing cards, except Machina and Rem, it was changed. His weapon is Tarot cards.</p><p>Playing Ace is almost a game in itself. He has an ability called deck open which allows him to draw 4 new cards and depending on the cards he can heal or enhance abilities of other party members. He can also throw cards at close range or a distance.</p><h3><b>Trey</b></h3><p>Trey is Italian for "three" so that explains his name. His weapon is a bow and arrow.</p><h3><b>Cinque</b></h3><p>Italian for "five", she is armed with a mace.</p><h3><b>Seven</b></h3><p>She is armed with a chain whip.</p><h3><b>Eight</b></h3><p>He only fights using martial arts, only his legs in particular.</p><h3><b>Nine</b></h3><p>He is armed only with a Spear that has a red tip. Nine is the dragoon of the group. He can spin and damage enemies in a circle. He also has a jump ability like <a href="/freya-crescent/3005-1919/" data-ref-id="3005-1919">Freya</a> from <a href="/final-fantasy-ix/3030-8825/" data-ref-id="3030-8825">Final Fantasy IX</a> that damages enemies from the sky by landing on them.</p><h3><b>Jack</b></h3><p>He uses a katana as his main weapon.</p><h3><b>Queen</b></h3><p>The one with the glasses that uses a saber and has a fencing style and uses a lot of acrobatic moves in combat. Her attacks are easily chain-able, she even has an ability called "Cross" that hits enemies in a line.</p><h3><strong>King</strong></h3><p>He uses dual pistol as his main weapon.</p><h3><b>Kurasame</b></h3><p>Who seems to be known as the "Ice Blade of Death" and is the instructor of these students and is not featured in the picture above and apparently uses a <a href="/tonberry/3015-3508/" data-ref-id="3015-3508">Tonberry</a> in battle. Not a playable character though.</p><p>The others that don't have names seem to be a female with a shotgun, a male with dual handguns, a female with a flute and a female with a scythe.</p><p>These characters have just been released as of April 25th 2011, the 3rd characters name has not yet been romanized into English.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/127136/1752166-agito_map.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1752166" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.64024390243902" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:64.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/127136/1752166-agito_map.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1752166"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Map of Oriens" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/127136/1752166-agito_map.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/127136/1752166-agito_map.jpg" alt="Map of Oriens"></noscript></a><figcaption>Map of Oriens</figcaption></figure><p>The world of Type-0 is called Oriens and is broken up to 4 regions each powered by a crystal. (Crystals have for years been a staple in Final Fantasy universes, and typically their purpose powering stuff. If the crystal breaks usually that place is screwed.) The names of the 4 regions are as follows: Rubrum, Milites, Anaze, and Kogai. [I don't think the names will be changed much if at all later.] These 4 regions are surrounded around a magic school called "Peristylium", specifically in Type-0 it will focus on the Rubrum Peristyilum Suzaku Magic academy, which is on an island not attached to the main land of the continent.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/127136/1752168-rubrum_peristylium_suzaku_magic_academy_final_fantasy_type_0.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1752168" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.56666666666667" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/127136/1752168-rubrum_peristylium_suzaku_magic_academy_final_fantasy_type_0.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1752168"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Rubrum Peristylum Suzaku Magic Academy seen in the game." class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/127136/1752168-rubrum_peristylium_suzaku_magic_academy_final_fantasy_type_0.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/127136/1752168-rubrum_peristylium_suzaku_magic_academy_final_fantasy_type_0.jpg" alt="Rubrum Peristylum Suzaku Magic Academy seen in the game."></noscript></a><figcaption>Rubrum Peristylum Suzaku Magic Academy seen in the game.</figcaption></figure><p>A pact/treaty of peace called "Pax Codex" was signed between the nations where the crystals are located. Under the command of High Commander Cid Oldstien, (Final Fantasy sure loves their Cids) Byakko breaks said peace treaty and begins an assault on other nations in airships and <a href="/lcie/3015-4802/" data-ref-id="3015-4802">L'Cie</a> with magical armor. He (Cid) manages to take over all the nations except Suzaku because of their strong resistance. Byakko does manage to disable the crystal's power though and tries to convince the Rubrum president to lay down their weapons and surrender because without the crystal the nation is pretty much without power and can't defend themselves. 12 students some how managed to keep their powers with the crystal pact (I am assuming this crystal pact is what one needs to do to get their magic powers in the first place and if the crystal goes down or becomes disabled they cant use them but, this is different for these 12.) and plan to stop Cid's hostile take over with an operation they have dubbed "Operation Apostle" to take down his forces.</p><h2>Development</h2><p>Type-0 was originally entitled Final Fantasy Agito XIII, and was intended to be a part of <a href="/square-enix/3010-104/" data-ref-id="3010-104">Square Enix's</a> <a href="/fabula-nova-crystallis/3025-612/" data-ref-id="3025-612">Fabula Nova Crystallis</a> sub-series of games set within the universe of <a href="/final-fantasy-xiii/3030-20664/" data-ref-id="3030-20664">Final Fantasy XIII</a>. It was also originally developed as a cell phone game due to the popularity of <a href="/before-crisis-final-fantasy-vii/3030-22118/" data-ref-id="3030-22118">Before Crisis</a>, with functions only available on cellphones, but development shifted to the PSP in hopes of broadening the game's audience. Another reason for the shift was that Square Enix wanted to release the game for a more powerful platform.</p><p>At a <a href="/square-enix/3010-104/" data-ref-id="3010-104">Square Enix</a> event held on January 18th, 2011, it was officially announced that Final Fantasy Agito XIII was being renamed Final Fantasy Type-0, a title with the intent of becoming the starting point for a new franchise. The game has been completely separated from Final Fantasy XIII's story and world, and is now set within its own original universe. At the same event, it was also announced that Type-0 would ship on two UMDs due to the large amount of voice acting in the game with over thirty speaking parts.</p><h2>Final Fantasy Type-0 HD</h2><p>Final Fantasy Type-0 HD is a remake of the <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-portable/3045-18/" data-ref-id="3045-18">PSP</a> game Final Fantasy Type-0 for the <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-one/3045-145/" data-ref-id="3045-145">Xbox One</a> and <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/" data-ref-id="3045-146">PlayStation 4</a>. Due for release on March 17, 2015, it is the first version of the game be localized for official release outside of Japan. In addition to the graphics upgrade, the game difficulty and mechanics are also being tweaked to allow for multiple difficulty levels. The game will also allow the player to choose between Japanese and English voice acting.</p><h3>Final Fantasy XV Demo</h3><p>Newly purchased copies of Final Fantasy Type-0 HD came with a redeemable code for a demo of Final Fantasy XV.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Goemon's first (and only) arcade adventure, the goal of the game is to reach the end of every stage while avoiding or defeating the guards that try to stop <a data-ref-id="3005-1989" href="/goemon/3005-1989/">Goemon</a>. Goemon's main weapon is his <a data-ref-id="3055-1348" href="/pipe/3055-1348/">pipe</a>, but he can also jump on enemies and pick up and throw items that are scattered throughout the levels. The graphical style of the game is based on the classical Japanese drawing style known as Ukiyo-e, a type of art style used between the 17th and 20th centuries.</p>]]></description>

The real Nameless Hero, now known as King Rhobar III, is an evil king. The second hero's task is in the player's hands. You can convince Rhobar that he shouldn't be evil, end his ruling, kill him, or ignore him, and even join him and ally with him. The destiny of Myrtana lies in the player's hands.</p><p> </p><h2>PC System Requirements</h2><p><br /></p><ul><li><b>Operating System</b>: Microsoft® Windows® XP / Vista / Windows 7</li><li><b>Processor</b>: Intel Core 2 Duo @ 2.8 GHz / AMD Athlon II x2 @ 2.8 GHz</li><li><b>Memory</b>: 2 GB RAM</li><li><b>Graphics Card</b>:GeForce 8800 GTX</li><li><b>DirectX®</b>: DirectX 9.0c or higher</li><li><b>Disk Space</b>: 9 GB HDD</li><li><b>Sound Card</b>: DirectX 8.1 compatible sound card</li></ul><p><b>PC Recommended Requirements</b></p><ul><li><b>Operating System</b>: Microsoft® Windows® XP / Vista / Windows 7</li><li><b>Processor</b>: Intel Core I7 @ 3 GHz / AMD Phenom II x4 @ 3 GHz</li><li><b>Memory</b>: 4 GB RAM</li><li><b>Graphics Card</b>: GeForce GTX 295</li><li><b>DirectX®</b>: DirectX 9.0c or higher</li><li><b>Disk Space</b>: 9 GB HDD Space</li><li><b>Sound Card</b>: DirectX 8.1 compatible sound car</li></ul>]]></description>

Some choices are more significant than others, and at the end of each Book the game provides some hint of the amount of significance each of the player's choices will have on the story, as well as displaying the percentage of players who also made the same choice.</p><p>The game follows the Azadi Apostle <a href="/kian-alvane/3005-2655/" data-ref-id="3005-2655">Kian Alvane</a> and the bioengineering student <a href="/zoe-castillo/3005-543/" data-ref-id="3005-543">Zoë Castillo</a>, the two protagonists from Dreamfall: The Longest Journey, as well as a new character Saga. As with the previous games, it splits its running time between the scientific world of Stark (our world) and the magical world of Arcadia.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The player controls a character using a combination of point-and-click and direct control. The developers have made some changes based on fan feedback, such as removing the combat elements of the previous game and most of its stealth.</p><h2>Development</h2><p>Though announced in March of 2007, <a href="/funcom-productions-as/3010-575/" data-ref-id="3010-575"> Funcom</a> development of Dreamfall Chapters was put on indefinite hold until November 2012 when the IP was licensed to series creator <a href="/ragnar-trnquist/3040-89550/" data-ref-id="3040-89550"> Ragnar Tørnquist</a>'s new studio, <a href="/red-thread-games/3010-8388/" data-ref-id="3010-8388"> Red Thread Games</a>. It was financed through a combination of <a href="/kickstarter-funded/3015-7378/" data-ref-id="3015-7378"> crowdfunding</a> on <a href="/kickstarter-funded/3015-7378/" data-ref-id="3015-7378"> Kickstarter</a> and a 175,000 USD grant from the Norwegian Film Institute. The Kickstarter project page can be found <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/redthread/dreamfall-chapters-the-longest-journey" rel="nofollow"> here</a>. The game was developed in <a href="/unity-engine/3015-5683/" data-ref-id="3015-5683"> Unity</a>.</p><h2>Release</h2><p>Dreamfall Chapters was released in five parts. The first, Book One: Reborn, was scheduled for release on October 21st 2014 on PC, Linux and Mac. The game will subsequently be released on PlayStation 4.

      <deck><![CDATA[A first-person puzzle game for PSN revolving around mechanics that allow the player to slowly reveal the world around them.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p>The Unfinished Swan is a game that was first shown at the 2009 Independent Games festival. In the first part of the game, the player begins in a space where everything is white. The game plays like a first-person shooter where the geometry of the level is revealed as ink is shot onto objects in the space. Some areas reveal messages such as "Don't be afraid" and "Please wake up."</p><p>Later mechanics include shooting drops of water onto the geometry to lead climbing vines around the walls, using light mechanics to stay safe and drawing geometry to create platforms that can than be used for platforming.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>The game follows the adventures of a recently orphaned child as he chases his mother's unfinished artwork, a painting of a <a data-ref-id="3015-3816" href="/swan/3015-3816/">swan</a>, through a strange world. While there he finds that the King of this land had trouble finishing his work, and ultimately gives up trying to create a city in order to start a family. The King becomes too focused on his work and his pregnant wife, the boy's mother, leaves him. The boy finds his father, the King, in an unfinished statue and the King gives him his silver brush. The boy returns to the orphanage and is able to finish his mother's painting of the swan.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The gameplay uses standard dual-analog or Playstation Move control from a first-person perspective to allow the player to move through the world - the move controller utilising the screen edge to look around. There are a number of gameplay mechanics introduced throughout the game, all with the theme of throwing globules of paint to interact with the world.</p><p>Initially, this is introduced as literal blank canvas in a white, blank world. The indelible black paint is the players only means of revealing the geometry and progressing through the first few levels, whereupon other colours are introduced.</p><p>The paint mechanic then turns to throwing water, the effect is now temporary, but can be used with numerous interactive elements in the form of paddles, controlling bridges, moving cranes and even dams.</p><p>The most prominent use of the water is in growing vines, creating a ladder mechanic to any surface in the game - horizontal or vertical - and allowing the player to scale towers or cross underneath bridges. Where the water splashes, the vines will leap out in growth to, it is only constrained by crevices featured where the vine mechanic is used, but the player is given relative freedom in their approach to a number of puzzles.</p><p>The later levels conversely are pitch black, where the player must stay in patches of light to stay safe. These can be created or expanded by hitting light sources, by pushing around a ball of light or by following it when rolling down a hill or through rivers and over waterfalls.</p><p>The final mechanic to be introduced uses the paint mechanic to create multicoloured cuboid objects upon any 'blueprint' surface. Where the first 2 paint globes land creates an X and Y bounding box, before using the final globe to adjust the depth. The boxes can also be manipulated and moved in certain circumstances.</p><p>The player can also collect balloons, which can then be used to buy "toys" which help the player by giving him more abilities to use in the game. Examples of which include a balloon radar, a sniper rifle, the ability to stop time momentarily for the paint globes as many others.</p>]]></description>

The game will be set approximately 150 years after the events of <a data-ref-id="3030-229" href="/kingdom-under-fire-the-crusaders/3030-229/">     Kingdom Under Fire: The Crusaders </a> features the return of the Human Alliance, the Dark Legion and the mysterious Encablossians whose aim is to destroy the Age of Light which has far overrun its natural course.  The Encablossians are let by the Dark Warrior Regnier who allied himself with Encabblosa while trapped in the Dark Dimension.<br /><br /><h3>First trailer released</h3><br />on November 13, 2008, a trailer was released to the public. It showed a new character wielding a large sword and also being able to shoot guns. The number of units seem to be in-game and number in the estimated thousands. "Wyverns" were also shown but this time it seems you will have the option to directly control them. Another interesting aspect of the trailer is the fact that archers were seen on top of a castle wall, possible hinting at castle sieges. Finally, near the end of the trailer, a large creature was shown stomping through the battlefield and crushing units under it's feet. This could possible be a new unit or a successor to the "mammoth" in the original game.<br /><br /><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14036/813198-00773930.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-813198" data-size="small" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14036/813198-00773930.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-813198"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14036/813198-00773930.jpg" alt="Many old characters will be returning."></a><figcaption>Many old characters will be returning.</figcaption></figure> The game takes place 150 years after the conclusion of  Kingdom Under Fire: The Crusaders.

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p>Trine is 2D side-scrolling puzzle platform game that was developed by <a href="/frozenbyte-inc/3010-4203/" data-ref-id="3010-4203">Frozenbyte, Inc.</a> and released for the <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC</a> and <a href="/playstation-3/3055-1463/" data-ref-id="3055-1463">PlayStation 3</a> (via PSN) during the summer of 2009. Then on July 24th 2014 the game a remake / enhanced version of the game (Trine: Enchanted Edition) was released on the <a href="/playstation-4/3045-146/" data-ref-id="3045-146">PlayStation 4</a> and <a href="/wii-u/3045-139/" data-ref-id="3045-139">Wii U</a> featuring a graphical overhaul using the engine used to create the sequel <a href="/trine-2/3030-31661/" data-ref-id="3030-31661">Trine 2</a> and online multiplayer.</p><h2>Characters</h2><p>The characters in Trine are very much lighter versions of the archetypal definition of three very famous fantasy classes:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><h3>Amadeus, the <a href="../../wizards/92-1694/" rel="nofollow"><b>Wizard</b></a></h3> Amadeus is an "old" wizard still "studying" at the Astral Academy. Through a series of accidents, he's left behind in the castle when the undead army approaches. Usually, at Amadeus' age, wizards would have graduated and left, but Amadeus never quite passed the wizarding exams. He's never even learned the fireball spell, having always been more interested in flirting with the girls and going to great lengths to pretend that he's a magnificent wizard. However, this traditionally only leads to failure.<br /><u><b>Abilities</b></u>: Despite not having learned the fireball spell, Amadeus knows still a few useful spells. He can summon Boxes and Planks and he can also levitate objects. Through the course of the game, he will learn to cast Boxes and Planks in larger quantities.</td><td><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1552784-character_amadeus.png" data-ref-id="1300-1552784" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.4508196721311" data-width="122" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 122px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:145.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1552784-character_amadeus.png" data-ref-id="1300-1552784"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1552784-character_amadeus.png" alt="Amadeus, the Wizard"></a><figcaption>Amadeus, the Wizard</figcaption></figure></td></tr><tr><td><h3>Pontius, the <a href="../../warriors/92-2646/" rel="nofollow"><b>Knight</b></a></h3> Pontius isn't really a Knight, but he does dream of joining the King's army and what better way to do that than to battle against the undead and prove himself worthy of knighthood? The problem is that Pontius doesn't really know what "undead" means, and he thinks he's the only one staying behind to face the enemy in the castle. Pontius is a large individual and enjoys a fine dose of meat at every hour or so. He's a friendly, happy fellow, and thinks good of everything and everyone. Unless he's hungry, of course. Pontius is a bit on the slow side, though -- he never gets a joke, and doesn't quite understand all the magic business going on around him.<br /><u><b>Abilities</b></u>: Pontius has an impressive arsenal of melee weapons. His strength also comes in handy when it comes to lifting heavy objects, or throwing them upon your enemies. Pontius also has a shield that he can use to block attacks. He cannot swim in his armor, though.</td><td><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1552786-character_pontius.png" data-ref-id="1300-1552786" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.4508196721311" data-width="122" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 122px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:145.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1552786-character_pontius.png" data-ref-id="1300-1552786"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1552786-character_pontius.png" alt="Pontius, the Knight"></a><figcaption>Pontius, the Knight</figcaption></figure></td></tr><tr><td><h3>Zoya, the <a href="../../rogues/92-1460/" rel="nofollow"><b>Thief</b></a></h3> Zoya is from a distant land. She heard there was an ancient object with tremendous value in the castle and realizing that the Undead army marching towards the castle had already done half the job for her by leaving the castle abandoned, she feels that the time is right to break in and steal the precious treasure. Zoya is a great thief and has a soft spot for all things shiny, but not much else is known about her. She keeps to herself and doesn't like anyone asking her any questions. She's not one to reveal any kind of secrets about her.<br /><u><b>Abilities</b></u>: Zoya is an amazing archer. Her ranged attacks are great for hitting enemies at a long distances. Zoya also carries a grappling-hook that she can attach to wooden surfaces. She can then grab onto them and swing herself over ledges and climb up or down with the rope.</td><td><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1552787-character_zoya.png" data-ref-id="1300-1552787" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.4508196721311" data-width="122" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 122px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:145.1%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1552787-character_zoya.png" data-ref-id="1300-1552787"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Zoya, the Thief" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1552787-character_zoya.png"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1552787-character_zoya.png" alt="Zoya, the Thief"></noscript></a><figcaption>Zoya, the Thief</figcaption></figure></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Trine bills itself as a "physics-based action game", and focuses on platforming, combat, and simple puzzle solving. The player uses the knight, the thief, and the wizard to work their way through this 2D side scrolling environment, and can switch between the characters throughout the game at any time. Each character has their own individual abilities that can be used to solve various conundrums faced by the player.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1042974-trine_screenshot_2009_06_ef.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1042974" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="480" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:62.5%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1042974-trine_screenshot_2009_06_ef.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1042974"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="The Thief navigates the forests of Trine" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1048/1042974-trine_screenshot_2009_06_ef.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1048/1042974-trine_screenshot_2009_06_ef.jpg" alt="The Thief navigates the forests of Trine"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Thief navigates the forests of Trine</figcaption></figure><p>The Knight uses a heavy sword, and can lift, carry and throw heavy objects, and can lift his shield to block attacks. The Thief can use a <a href="/grapple/3055-5/" data-ref-id="3055-5">grappling hook</a> on wooden surfaces and use her bow and arrow to kill enemies and activate remote switches. The Wizard is unique in that he has the ability to summon physical objects, such as boxes and planks, which can be used as a stepping stone for higher jumps, to drop on enemies, or to block projectiles. Each character has their own health and energy bar as well which adds a layer of management to the game's equation.</p><h3>Leveling Up</h3><p>There are two ways to gain experience in Trine:</p><ol><li>Killing enemies and taking the "auras" or "souls" they leave behind</li><li>By finding green potions scattered and hidden throughout all the levels</li></ol><p>The latter creates interesting mini-challenges as you go, as these potions are often hidden or just apparently out of reach, causing the player to use creative problem solving to retrieve the potion. Once the player recovers a certain amount of green potions or enemy "souls", they are allowed to <a href="/leveling-up/3015-475/" data-ref-id="3015-475">level up</a> one of the characters, granting upgrades like increased damage and new attacks. The secret treasure chests are generally hidden much more discreetly and requires the player to get creative in order to find &amp; reach their location. Treasures grant the characters other special abilities, and while some can be swapped between more than one character, others are character specific.</p><h3>Local Co-Op</h3><p>The game has local co-op multiplayer, allowing up to two other players to join your game. This adds a new element to the gameplay, by allowing new ways to overcome obstacles by combining each characters abilities. To play the game co-op on the <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC</a>, you may now use any <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC</a> <a href="/game-controller/3015-3601/" data-ref-id="3015-3601">gamepad</a> (including the <a href="/pc-games-with-xbox-360-controller-support/3015-2465/" data-ref-id="3015-2465">Xbox 360 controller</a>), or multiple <a href="/keyboard/3055-2361/" data-ref-id="3055-2361">keyboards</a> and <a href="/mouse/3055-2362/" data-ref-id="3055-2362">mice</a>. Each player may also assign their own controls if they wish.</p><p>Trine designer and <a href="/">Frozenbyte</a> CEO, <a href="/">Lauri Hyvärinen</a> has said they plan to add online multiplayer at a later date, but this seems less likely of possibility as time passes.</p><h2>Inventory Items</h2><p>Throughout the course of the game, the player -- if adventurous enough -- can find a series of items inside of <a href="/treasure-chest/3055-517/" data-ref-id="3055-517">treasure chests</a> (some of them <a href="/hidden-treasure-chest/3055-3582/" data-ref-id="3055-3582">hidden</a> away from the game's main path) that will make his/her journey through the world of Trine a lot easier.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Item</th><th>Item Description</th><th>Buffs</th><th>Usable

for PC on July 2, 2009, the release for the PlayStation Network was delayed, likely in order to optimize it for the PS3 platform. In mid-July, a Frozenbyte employee posted on the game's official forums saying that the game would be released on July 30. However, on July 29 the same Frozenbyte employee wrote, "Unfortunately, Trine isn't coming to PSN this week, and this time it's our fault as there was discovered yet another small bug, which needed to be fixed."</p><p>Some cited the release of Sony's <a href="/fat-princess/3030-21184/" data-ref-id="3030-21184">Fat Princess</a>, also scheduled for release on July 30, as the reason for the delay. They hypothesized that Sony must have forced Frozenbyte to push back the release of Trine, fearing low sales due to competition. However, that theory seemed less and less likely as more time passed without a Trine release.</p><p>Trine was eventually released on PSN in Europe on September 17th 2009, and on October 22nd in North America. One of the advantages of buying the game on PSN was supposed to be that it would be $10 cheaper than the PC version, but the price of the PC version dropped $10 before the PSN release, leaving that advantage unrealized.</p><h2>Free DLC...and Hint of a Sequel</h2><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8485/1347651-trine_2010_04_23_22_26_31_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1347651" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.8" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8485/1347651-trine_2010_04_23_22_26_31_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1347651"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="More Trine to come?" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8485/1347651-trine_2010_04_23_22_26_31_01.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8485/1347651-trine_2010_04_23_22_26_31_01.jpg" alt="More Trine to come?"></noscript></a><figcaption>More Trine to come?</figcaption></figure><p>On April 19th 2010, Frozenbyte released a free DLC level for the PC titled "Path to New Dawn" (the level was later released on the PSN on August 3rd, 2010 for $0.99). The level becomes available upon completion of the game and features 10 unique items for players to collect.</p><p>Upon completing the level, an image of a dragon appears on screen with a note reading "The story has just begun...". While this teased that this might not be the end of the Trine storyline, the sequel for the game, <a href="/trine-2/3030-31661/" data-ref-id="3030-31661">Trine 2</a>, wasn't officially unveiled until <a href="/e3-2010/3015-4529/" data-ref-id="3015-4529">E3 2010</a>.</p><h2>Enchanted Edition</h2><p>In 2014, a new version of Trine, dubbed Enchanted Edition, was released for PC, Linux, Mac, PlayStation 4 and Wii U. The Enchanted Edition is a free update for owners of the Steam version but players can choose between it and the original base version upon starting the game. Now running on the more capable Trine 2 engine, the Enchanted Edition introduces an online co-op mode, mid-level saving.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>Trine is set in a fantasy kingdom, which was once beautiful and prosperous, but has since fallen into ruin due to an undead army that attacked the kingdom. Trine starts with three adventurers, a knight named <a href="/pontius/3005-10700/" data-ref-id="3005-10700">Pontius</a>, a thief named <a href="/zoya/3005-10701/" data-ref-id="3005-10701">Zoya</a>, and a wizard named <a href="/amadeus/3005-10699/" data-ref-id="3005-10699">Amadeus</a>, who simultaneously stumble upon an ancient artifact called the Trine. All three touch the Trine at the same time, which magically fuses all three souls into one body. They each maintain their individual voices &amp; consciousnesses, but can only inhabit the single body one at a time. Luckily, they are able to transform into any one of the three characters at any time they choose.</p><p>The trio are reluctant to work together, but in order to find a way to counteract the Trine and separate their souls from each other, they are forced to battle their way through the kingdom and the <a href="/undead/3015-1155/" data-ref-id="3015-1155">undead</a> armies to find a cure. The Wizard is able to decipher some ancient inscriptions, and they soon discover that the Trine is one part of a trio of ancient artifacts, representing the mind, the body, and the soul. The three artifacts are scattered through the kingdom, but the Wizard theorizes that if these three artifacts are brought together, it may free them from the Trine.</p><p>As the adventurers battle their way through the kingdom, they eventually do bring the three artifacts together, which indeed unbinds their souls from the Trine. Reuniting the artifacts also has the fortunate side effect of liberating the kingdom from the undead armies, and Pontius, Amadeus and Zoya are hailed as heroes.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1552791-trine_ost.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1552791" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.4798962386511" data-width="480" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:48.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1552791-trine_ost.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1552791"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Trine's Soundtrack Album Art" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/62890/1552791-trine_ost.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/62890/1552791-trine_ost.jpg" alt="Trine's Soundtrack Album Art"></noscript></a><figcaption>Trine's Soundtrack Album Art</figcaption></figure><p>The <a href="/original-soundtrack/3015-189/" data-ref-id="3015-189">soundtrack</a> for Trine was composed by <a href="/ari-pulkkinen/3040-90303/" data-ref-id="3040-90303">Ari Pulkkinen</a>.

      <deck><![CDATA[A puzzle platformer developed by Polytron that uses a 2D perspective shifting mechanic to solve puzzles and complete levels. The main character, a white creature named Gomez, wears a fez and is obsessed with collecting hats.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p>Fez was first shown at the 2008 <a href="/igf-awards/3015-3939/" data-ref-id="3015-3939">Independent Games Festival</a>. It was nominated for two awards and won the award for "Excellence in Visual Art". Following the awards, <a href="/phil-fish/3040-100988/" data-ref-id="3040-100988">Phil Fish</a>, the mastermind behind Fez created "Polytron Corporation" as a banner under which he would develop and release the game.</p><h2>Development</h2><p>In <i>Indie Game: The Movie</i>, Fish talked about his five year struggle with trying to maintain Polytron Corporation by himself after his lead sound designer Jason DeGroot left. When showing the game at PAX Prime 2011, Fish risked a lawsuit with his former business partner due to unsettled royalty disputes. During development, Fez was completely remade three times due to lack of funding. The game was given an (ironic) release date of Friday the 13th of 2012. At the <i>Indie Game: The Movie</i> premiere, Fish stated that he currently has no plans to bring Fez to any other platform, but will consider doing so if the game sells well.</p><p> </p><p>A PC version of Fez was released on May 1, 2013 (<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/224760/" rel="nofollow">Steam page</a>). Like the XBLA version, it's listed as being developed by Polytron and published by Trapdoor.</p><p>At Gamescom 2013, it was announced that Fez will come to PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation Vita.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p><a href="/gomez/3005-9607/" data-ref-id="3005-9607">Gomez</a> receives a letter, from a mysterious man with an <a href="/eyepatch/3055-94/" data-ref-id="3055-94">eyepatch</a>, telling him to meet him at the top of his town, when he arrives a mysterious object appears in the sky; a cube. Gomez suddenly gains the ability to rotate the 2D world in which he lives, and must collect cubes and their counterpart, anti-cubes.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10652/1617998-fez_p.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1617998" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.56210526315789" data-width="475" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 475px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10652/1617998-fez_p.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1617998"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10652/1617998-fez_p.jpg" alt="Gomez's room in 2D."></a><figcaption>Gomez's room in 2D.</figcaption></figure><p>As a puzzle-platformer, Fez gameplay is primarily map traversal, discovery, and item collection. Gomez can innately walk, jump, climb, ledge grab, drop through ledges, push, pick up, and throw items. During the opening sequence he gains the ability to rotate the perceived 2D world in 90 degree increments, around the vertical (Y) axis of the screen. This reveals that the environment is fully 3D in nature. Despite the ability to traverse multiple planes, Gomez can only move and interact with the 2D plane relative to the player, and will always migrate to the foreground layer when possible. For example, he cannot enter a doorway from the side, or when a background passage is obscured by a foreground object – even if Gomez is standing between them. He appears shadowed when in the background layer, and a silhouette when completely obscured behind the environment. (The music also becomes muffled.)</p><p>Gomez has no health meter, and upon death (by fall or otherwise) he will immediately respawn on the last stable platform he stood on. He also retains momentum relative to the world while it is rotated: jumping to the right and then rotating 180 degrees will continue the momentum to the left, but rotating 90 degrees will stop all forward motion.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13158/839153-gb.png" data-ref-id="1300-839153" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="480" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13158/839153-gb.png" data-ref-id="1300-839153"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/13158/839153-gb.png" alt="Gomez can rotate the world to reveal new perspectives."></a><figcaption>Gomez can rotate the world to reveal new perspectives.</figcaption></figure><p>There are 64 cubes to collect in total - 32 Gold Cubes and 32 Blue Anti-Cubes. As well as being able to find cubes throughout the world, cube bits can be collected throughout the game and once 8 cube bits are found they create 1 cube. Anti-cubes are generally more difficult to obtain, requiring puzzle solving rather than standard platforming. Some puzzles involve deciphering glyphs and following their instructions. Others are rhythm puzzles, where the controller vibrates and a rotational direction correlates to the sound the controller makes while it vibrates.</p><p>Once the ending kill screen is reached, the player can then start a New Game + after the credits and gain the ability to view the world from a first person perspective. Certain puzzles require use of the first person view in order to complete them. New Game + also unlocks the ability to fly (to activate press up four times and then hold A). Once the game is completed a second time, a stereoscopic 3D option is unlocked.</p><h2>Environment</h2><p>The world of Fez consists of several areas which appear normal, but may contain physics-defying characteristics even beyond Gomez's abilities. For example, some maps scroll infinitely up and down in an endless loop. Others have an infinite cycle of passages or use doors to teleport to far away islands.</p><h3>World Map</h3><p>The world map is an intricate and complex 3D tree of branching locations. Every level and room in the game is a separate "area", represented as a hexagonal cell. When an area is explored, the map cell indicates what items and secrets remain to be discovered. When all secrets within a single area are discovered, the thumbnail and border of that map cell acquires a gold sheen.</p><h3>Warping</h3><p>There are several hub areas within Fez, and cubic warp gates link them together once discovered and activated. Smaller square warp gates transport Gomez back to the start of an area, and save the player an excessive amount of backtracking. Simpler, shortcut doors also open up specific routes between areas once the entrance is discovered and unlocked.</p><h3>Hazards</h3><ul><li><a href="/falling-damage/3015-2510/" data-ref-id="3015-2510">Falling</a> – Gomez can fall approximately 8 blocks before the drop will automatically kill him, unless he lands in water. This measurement counts from his starting position, and does not take jump height into account.</li><li><a href="/crushing-trap/3015-3627/" data-ref-id="3015-3627">Crushing</a> – Certain platforms move vertically, and if they collide while Gomez is between them he will respawn on the last stable platform.</li><li><a href="/black-hole/3055-915/" data-ref-id="3055-915">Black Holes</a> – Rips in space areas may appear in the environment. They suck Gomez in if he comes into contact with them.</li><li>Regenerating Blocks – <a href="/bomb/3055-97/" data-ref-id="3055-97">Bombs</a> are required to remove certain blocks, but if the entire chain is not destroyed they will regenerate and knock Gomez off the platform.</li><li>Totems – In certain areas, there may be powerful totems which prevent Gomez from freely rotating the screen. These totems must be interacted with and backtracked to, in order to access all sides of an area.</li><li>Water – Gomez is a buoyant swimmer and can jump out of water with no loss of height. <a href="/water-that-damages-the-player/3015-3841/" data-ref-id="3015-3841">Hazardous water</a> will kill him instantly.</li></ul><h2>Items</h2><h3>Artifacts</h3><p>There are four artifacts hidden around the world in Fez. With the exception of the skull, these artifacts contain glyphs and are used to help decipher the language and numbers.</p><ul><li>Writing Cube</li><li>Counting Cube</li><li>Tome</li><li>Skull</li></ul><h2>Glyphs</h2><p>Fez contains a hidden language, numerical system, and code. Each is conveyed through glyphs found throughout the game.</p><h3>Alphabet</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/15/156864/2183320-FEZ_Alphabet.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2183320" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.64705882352941" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:64.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/15/156864/2183320-FEZ_Alphabet.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2183320"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2183320-FEZ_Alphabet.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/15/156864/2183320-FEZ_Alphabet.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/15/156864/2183320-FEZ_Alphabet.jpg" alt="2183320-FEZ_Alphabet.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>The alphabet is most easily deciphered by entering a room where a red fox is jumping over a dog which is laying on the ground. Next to them are glyphs which correspond to the popular saying: the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. This sentence provides enough letters to construct the alphabet.</p><h3>Numbers</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/109148/2182961-numbers.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2182961" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.4868421052632" data-width="228" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 228px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:148.7%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/109148/2182961-numbers.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2182961"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2182961-numbers.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/10/109148/2182961-numbers.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/10/109148/2182961-numbers.jpg" alt="2182961-numbers.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>Numbers in Fez can be expressed several ways. Numbers correlate to the open spaces in each square (if the player is looking at the white, negative space). One equals an open space on the top of the square. Two equals an open space on the right of the square. Three equals and open space at the bottom of the square. Four equals an open space the the left side of the square. Consulting the chart on the right, the number three can also be represent with an open space on the top and on the right; or, in other words, 1 + 2 = 3.</p><h3>Code</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/15/156864/2183323-FEZ_Inputs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2183323" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.6" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:60.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/15/156864/2183323-FEZ_Inputs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2183323"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2183323-FEZ_Inputs.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/15/156864/2183323-FEZ_Inputs.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/15/156864/2183323-FEZ_Inputs.jpg" alt="2183323-FEZ_Inputs.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>There are glyphs composed of <a href="/tetromino/3055-1722/" data-ref-id="3055-1722">tetrominos</a> which represent controller inputs. These glyphs are usually written vertically from top to bottom, and they are usually connected to each other. When the corresponding buttons are pressed, a secret is revealed. Pro-tip: The center point of the T-blocks indicate their direction.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p>During Fez's development circa 2009, music was composed by Canadian resident artist "6955", <a href="/jason-degroot/3040-101692/" data-ref-id="3040-101692">Jason DeGroot</a>. These demo tracks were <a href="http://polytroncorporation.com/fez-music" rel="nofollow">released</a> on Polytron's website. (Page has since been removed as of the OST release.)</p><p>The game's official soundtrack was composed and performed by the San Francisco resident artist "Disasterpeace", <a href="/rich-vreeland/3040-100079/" data-ref-id="3040-100079">Rich Vreeland</a>. The digital album may be <a href="http://disasterpeace.com/album/fez" rel="nofollow">ordered</a> via Bandcamp, and was released on April 20th, 2012.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Number</th><th>Track Title</th><th>Length</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Adventure</td><td>3:18</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Puzzle</td><td>2:14</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Beyond</td><td>3:05</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Progress</td><td>4:16</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Beacon</td><td>2:33</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Flow</td><td>3:47</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Formations</td><td>2:20</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Legend</td><td>1:18</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Compass</td><td>2:43</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Forgotten</td><td>2:34</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Sync</td><td>2:19</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Glitch</td><td>3:25</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Fear</td><td>3:32</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>Spirit</td><td>2:52</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>Nature</td><td>4:10</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>Knowledge</td><td>1:49</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>Death</td><td>3:31</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>Memory</td><td>1:16</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>Pressure</td><td>4:00</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>Nocturne</td><td>2:13</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>Age</td><td>2:58</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>Majesty</td><td>3:22</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>Continuum</td><td>2:35</td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td>Home</td><td>1:35</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>Reflection</td><td>9:02</td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td>Love</td><td>1:09</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The track "<a href="http://disasterpeace.com/track/continuum" rel="nofollow">Continuum</a>", which appears in the final cinematic sequence, consists of an arrangement by Vreeland of Frederic Chopin's Piano Prelude Op. 28 No. 4 in E minor.</p><h3>Tracks used in media preview videos</h3><ul><li><a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/videos/this-is-one-long-fez-screenshot/2300-4826/" data-ref-id="2300-4826">This Is One Long Fez Screenshot</a> - Beacon</li><li><a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/videos/an-even-longer-fez-screenshot/2300-4981/" data-ref-id="2300-4981">An Even Longer Fez Screenshot</a> - Fear</li><li><a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/videos/fez-long-screenshot-the-third/2300-5350/" data-ref-id="2300-5350">Fez Long Screenshot The Third</a> - Spirit</li><li><a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/videos/fez-long-trailer/2300-5775/" data-ref-id="2300-5775">Fez Long Trailer</a> - Compass</li></ul><h3>Soundtrack Alternate Reality Game</h3><p>On April 20th a <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/961239-fez/62594884/">GameFAQs thread</a> was created discussing spectrographic analysis of the soundtrack's files.

      <deck><![CDATA[The tenth installment in the Dragon Quest series is an MMORPG for Wii and Wii U and is the first game in the series to be developed internally at Square-Enix.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p>Dragon Quest X: Mezameshi Itsutsu no Shuzoku Online (The Wake of the Five Tribes Online) was revealed by <a href="/square-enix/3010-104/" data-ref-id="3010-104">Square-Enix</a> during a <a href="/dragon-quest/3025-160/" data-ref-id="3025-160">Dragon Quest</a> conference on September 05, 2011. The game is an MMORPG released for both the <a href="/wii/3045-36/" data-ref-id="3045-36">Wii</a> and the <a href="/wii-u/3045-139/" data-ref-id="3045-139">Wii U</a> with later ports to Android devices, PC and Nintendo 3DS. Square Enix have also stated that bringing the game to the <a href="/nintendo-nx-working-title/3045-157/" data-ref-id="3045-157">Nintendo NX</a> is "under consideration".</p><p>The Wii version of the game was released in Japan on the 2nd of August 2012 with a basic subscription fee of 1000 yen for 30 days. The Wii U released in Japan in Spring 2013.</p><p>The Nintendo 3DS version, unveiled in early July 2014 utilizes cloud-streaming technology to stream the game to the Nintendo 3DS. This allows for console-level graphics quality and cross-platform play with the Wii and Wii U versions of the game. However, since the game is running on Square Enix servers and streamed from there, it does not support the display of stereoscopic 3D. The missing buttons found on the other systems will be presented as icons on the 3DS' touch screen.</p><p>Features:</p><ul><li><a href="/nintendo-3ds/3045-117/" data-ref-id="3045-117">3DS</a> <a href="/streetpass-functionality/3015-6609/" data-ref-id="3015-6609">Streetpass</a> is supported via a separate app.</li><li>It can be played with a Wii Remote and Nunchuck, Classic Controller</li><li>USB keyboard can be used</li><li>The game uses a USB device of some kind for data management.</li><li>Some cross platform play with Wii and Wii U and 3DS.</li></ul><h2>Plot</h2><p>The protagonists are a mischievous pair of orphaned human siblings in the small village of Etene. Etene is also the home of residents Shini, a calm and reliable boy, and his grandmother Aba, a feisty shrine maiden.</p><p>After an initial portion of the game played as a human, the player character is reborn as a monster race. The player may choose from five races which their character will play the main part of the game as.</p><h2>Races</h2><p>The game has five playable tribes, each with a different continent in the world of Astordia.</p><h3>Ogres</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/134871/2006324-dragon_quest_x_ogre_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2006324" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/134871/2006324-dragon_quest_x_ogre_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2006324"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/134871/2006324-dragon_quest_x_ogre_02.jpg" alt="2006324-dragon_quest_x_ogre_02.jpg"></a></figure><p>Ogres are tall, horned, red humanoids known for their strength and courage.

They come from <b>Dwachakka</b>, a very mountainous area with thin vegetation.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Housing system</h3><p>Each of the five continents has an area where the player can buy a plot of land and build their own house with a House Kit. The interior layout is customizable, and furniture and crafting equipment can be set up inside.</p><h3>Artisan system</h3><p>The player can begin crafting items by registering at a guild (as a clothes specialist, weapon smith, etc.). Once the player has the required items, they can craft objects through a minigame.</p><h3>Multiplayer</h3><p>Players can communicate between preset phrases and gestures, or they can use free-text input with a USB keyboard.</p><p>Players can invite others to join their party's with a preset message, whereupon both players will agree on a length of time that they'll play together.</p><p>If players spot another group fighting, they can use a support command which causes the group's tension to rise.</p><p>There are also AI characters which the player can recruit at a pub. They'll behave like the party members in Dragon Quest 9 and will use whichever tactics you set out for them. The player can also turn themselves into an AI character, so when they're offline someone else can recruit their AI controlled character. When the player comes back, they will retain the experience they earned as an AI.</p><h2>Classes</h2><p>Switching classes works a lot like Dragon Quest 9. The player goes to the Branch Office of Dharma's Shrine to switch classes. Some skills carry over between classes, others do not. The level of the player's previous job is retained in case they want to switch back.</p><h3>Warrior</h3><h3>Monk</h3><p>Monks have low health and attack stats, but they're very adept with recover magic. They can use spears, clubs, and staffs.</p><h3>Mage</h3><p>Along with their natural magic ability, mages can wield the dual-handed staff, dagger, and whip.</p><h3>Thief</h3><p>Thieves wield daggers, claws, and whips. They also learn a few spells.</p><h3>Martial Artist</h3><h3>Minstrel</h3><h2>Pricing/Payment Model</h2><p>In Japan, the game has a monthly subscription fee of 1,000 Yen (about $12). However, to accommodate for the Dragon Quest series' younger audience, players will have two hours of free time every day. The free game time is only available during specific hours, namely 4 to 6 p.m. on weekdays and 1 to 3 p.m. on weekends.</p><p>This was decided based on customer feedback during demo events. Players will be notified before their free game time ends and those without money in their account will have their game saved before the session gets terminated. Supposedly, these terms are subject to change and Square Enix emphasized that they intended the free time solely for younger children.</p>]]></description>

Players explore the caves while amassing a fortune in treasure, acquiring better equipment, defeating relentless monsters, avoiding unforgiving <a href="/traps/3015-609/" data-ref-id="3015-609">traps</a>, and saving <a href="/damsel-in-distress/3015-100/" data-ref-id="3015-100">damsels in distress</a> along the way. However, the game features <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/permanent-death/3015-431/" data-ref-id="3015-431">permadeath</a>, in which death results in restarting the adventure from the very beginning.</p><p>The updated version of the game (known as "Spelunky HD" to differentiate it from the original) was released for <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC</a> via <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/steam/3015-718/" data-ref-id="3015-718">Steam</a> and <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/gogcom/3015-2379/" data-ref-id="3015-2379">Gog.com</a> on August 8, 2013.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Mechanics</h3><p>As a 2D platformer, the core abilities of the player include: attack, stomp, run, jump, ledge grab, and climb. The player may fall a significant distance before taking damage, which can be avoided by careful ledge grabs or equipment use. Ledges two blocks high can be grabbed normally, and equipment can greatly improve the player's traversal. Knockback physics are a significant aspect of taking damage, throwing items, and using bombs to affect the environment or attack. Air control in mid-jump includes the ability to start running, allowing for very precise and practiced maneuvers.</p><h3>Rewards</h3><p>Items and monetary rewards such as gold and jewels are scattered through every level, out in the open or inside containers. These containers range from breakable jars, to locked chests, to the very ground itself. Rewards are converted to specific amounts of money which serves as the player's final accumulated score. Equipment can also be discovered in the world, or purchased from shops.</p><p>One or more "damsels" can be rescued throughout the levels. They exist stationary until picked up, at which point they will begin walking if put down or thrown. They will not jump out of pits and will not pass through webs. Damsels have hit points just like the player, and can act as a limited damage sponge while being carried or thrown to trigger traps.</p><p>In the HD version; the sprites used for damsels can be swapped between a woman, a man, a dog (which can optionality be swapped out for a sloth) or one of the three randomly. All damsels rescued reward the player (at the level complete screen) with a kiss that restores one heart each.</p><p>In addition to rescuing damsels, players can choose to use them as sacrifice them at altars to gain favor with Kali. This will net the player useful items that can used as they descend further and further.</p><h2>Shops</h2><p>The player can purchase various goods from stores that can exist on the map. There are gun shops, bomb shops, general stores, gambling rooms, and even a sort of brothel complete with a spinning red light. It is possible simply to purchase a gun and then shoot the shopkeeper, resulting in free items and some dropped money. This carries grave consequences, as the player will become "wanted" and will no longer be welcome in stores. Entering any store after shoplifting will result in the shopkeeper becoming immediately hostile and trigger a shopkeeper standing near the exit to every level until the player dies or escapes the caves. This makes the game much more difficult, as one has to either scavenge for health and supplies or risk their life to rob another store. Any damage caused to a store will similarly make the shopkeeper angry. This includes boulders from picking up an idol, and any stray bombs. If a shopkeeper ever drops his shotgun by taking damage, he is entirely capable of picking up other weapons from his inventory! An angry NPC with a rapid fire energy weapon is a fast track to death.</p><ul><li>Gun shops contain firearms or explosives.</li><li>Bomb shops can contain more bombs, or the sticky bomb upgrade.</li><li>General stores can offer a wide variety of things. It could be more ropes or bombs or a multitude of other items.</li><li>Item shops can contain rarer items such as jetpacks, teleporters, and mattocks.</li><li>Clothing shops contain wearable items such as the cape or climbing gloves.</li></ul><h2>Weapons</h2><ul><li><b>Whip</b> - The whip is the most basic weapon, and also one of the most versatile. The whip has a damage of 3, and can reach one square, but can also hit an enemy that's behind the player if it's close enough.</li><li><b>Machete</b> - While the machete does less damage than the whip, it has a much faster attack speed, and wider arc range. A useful weapon, but doesn't replace the whip, meaning it takes up a handslot.</li><li><b>Bow (Classic only)</b> - The bow is the most basic of projectile weapons. An arrow can be knocked into the bow, and charged for additional damage. The Bow uses limited ammunition, but can be refilled if the player picks up the missed arrows.</li><li><b>Pistol (Classic only)</b> - The pistol is a basic weapon with unlimited ammunition that does more damage than the bow, but is still low damage.</li><li><b>Shotgun</b> - A powerful weapon that fires a spread of pellets at the enemy. It can take down nearly any normal enemy in one hit at close range. All shopkeepers carry these, and the weapon can be looted from a shopkeeper's body after he is killed.</li><li><b>Webgun</b> - The webgun shoots a spiderweb into the world, which takes up one square, and considerably slows down any enemies caught in it. Often used to kill shopkeepers with the "unlimited bounce trick". Webs will also stop arrows fired by traps.</li><li><strong>Freeze Ray</strong> - A gun that shoots a ray of frost, instantly freezing enemies for a short while. The gun itself does no damage, but most frozen enemies can be killed with one hit from another weapon or by jumping on them.</li><li><strong>Plasma Cannon</strong> - A very powerful gun, that can be found in the mothership level. It shoots plasma rays, that explode on impact, much like a bomb would.</li><li><b>Magic</b> <b>Scepter</b> - This weapon shoots homing rings of death towards the closest enemy, which will one-hit kill any enemy. The item is only obtainable in the Ancient Ruins.</li><li><b>Boomerang</b> - A large bent stick that will return horizontally after being thrown across the screen. Found often in the Jungle levels. When thrown by cavemen it can <a href="/juggling/3015-273/" data-ref-id="3015-273">juggle</a> and damage the player multiple times.</li><li><strong>Crysknife </strong>- A powerful knife that replaces the whip. The crysknife will one-hit kill most enemies in the game and is found in a pool of acid in the worm level.</li><li><strong>Shield</strong> - The Shield is a powerful melee weapon, capable of killing enemies whilst also blocking incoming damage.</li></ul><h2>Equipment</h2><p>Certain types of equipment are always active once obtained. These appear in their icon form underneath the life, bomb, and rope counters. Others work like carried items and can be picked up or left behind at will.</p><ul><li><b>Pitcher's Mitt</b> - The pitcher's mitt enhances the Spelunkers throw distance with any throwable item. Thrown items will be launched in a straight line and continue to travel until they hit an obstacle.</li><li><b>Spring Boots</b> - The spring boots boost the Spelunkers jump height from 2 squares to 4, making it double the height, and oftentimes, double the danger, in which the player will jump too high, and land in spikes!</li><li><b>Spike Boots</b> - The spike boots cause players do 3 damage on landing instead of 1. Also, the spike boots increase traction (particularly on ice).</li><li><b>Ropes</b> - In a single-player game, players begin with four ropes. Ropes allow players to climb up to hard to reach treasures, or allowing a safe descent from ledges.</li><li><b>Jetpack</b> - The Jetpack allows players to fly around levels. It is the most expensive item, but can be reliably found behind the psychic alien found in the Ice caves. The jetpack has a limited amount of fuel per jump; however, when players return to the ground, the fuel is restored.</li><li><b>Flares</b> - Flares are used to light up dark areas when there is no other light source, and can also be used as a makeshift projectile.</li><li><b>Spectacles</b> - Spectacles give the player the ability to see gems and items hidden in rocks, as well as giving the character the ability to have a wider range of view in dark levels.</li><li><b>Udjat Eye</b> - The Udjat Eye, in addition to showing hidden gems and items (like the Spectacles), blinks and chirps when the Spelunker is near the entrance to the Black Market.</li><li><b>Teleporter</b> - Allows teleportation in the direction the player is looking at or pressing towards, but if players teleport inside the ground or outside the level, they will die instantly. Also, most enemies are <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/telefrag/3015-40/" data-ref-id="3015-40">telefragged</a> if players teleport into them.</li><li><b>Hedjet</b> - The hedjet can be used with the scepter to open the secret door to the city of gold. In the classic version of Spelunky, the hedjet allows the player to see in the dark and prevents the ghost from spawning.</li><li><strong>Kapala</strong> - A skull cup, provided by Kali, after making sufficient sacrifices to her. It stores blood, which can be obtained when enemies or NPCs have been injured. It affords one heart every time it's filled.</li><li><strong>Book of the Dead</strong> - Reveals the location of the secret door to Hell by grimacing quickly when the Spelunker is directly above it.

When broken, the head of the mattock is left behind.</li><li><b>Parachute</b> - Will deploy automatically during any fall that would cause damage.</li><li><b>Camera</b> - The flash distracts nearby enemies and can stun ghosts for several seconds. It can also be used to kill undead enemies.</li><li><strong>Eggplant</strong> - The eggplant can be found by sacrificing a mystery box at an altar. The eggplant can be used on King Yama to turn him into a giant, immobile eggplant himself. The eggplant only has one HP.</li></ul><h2>Traps</h2><ul><li><b>Spikes</b> - Instant death, when dropped on from above. Gently landing on them (while using a Cape or Parachute, for example) is safe.</li><li><b>Arrow Trap</b> - 2 hearts damage. Will trigger with anything that crosses its line of sight.</li><li><b>Tiki Trap</b> - Tiki statues that extend spikes from their sides when the Spelunker or enemies approach.</li><li><b>Mines</b> - Explode when the player or other enemies walk over them.</li><li><b>Powder Box -</b> An explosive box filled with black powder.</li><li><b>Boulder -</b> Demolishes all in its horizontal path.

Each world also has random events or "feelings" that may trigger when a level is generated.</p><h4>World 1 - The Mines</h4><p>The caves are the first tileset in Spelunky. Scattered with minimal gold, spiders, scorpions, bats, snakes, and the occasional caveman, this is the easiest location. Random events include:</p><ul><li>"I can't see anything!" - Darkness consumes the level, a torch appears at the player's feet and there are sconces to be lit throughout the level. Golden scarabs also generate light and can be collected for a large amount of gold.</li><li>"I hear snakes! I hate snakes!" - An increased number and variety of snakes spawn. Always includes a deep shaft with a mulititude of snakes and jewels at the bottom. Also features a Mattock to dig with.</li><li>"My Skin is Crawling..." - An increased number of all varieties of spiders and webbing.</li></ul><h4>World 2 - The Jungle</h4><p>The jungle is a considerable step up from the Caves. Littered with frogs, exploding frogs, spike idols, piranhas, man eating plants, and "Jaws", this is the second state of play. Random events include:</p><ul><li>"The dead are restless!" - Gravestones populate the area, with a higher likelihood of Skeletons lying in wait. Piranhas are skeletal (but just as dangerous), and Vampires and Jiang Shi roam.</li><li>"You hear rushing water..." - The bottom of the level is flooded, and filled with Piranhas. Old Bitey waits for any Spelunker brave enough to dive into the depths.</li></ul><h4>World 3 - The Ice Caves</h4><p>The Ice Caves are considerably easier than the previous floors, with subtle differences. The Ice Caves have little traction, meaning the player can slip and slide all over, and there is no enclosed floor, meaning the player can plummet to their deaths in The Abyss. In addition to the aforementioned perils, there are also Yetis, Alien spaceships, and a boss Psychic Alien.</p><h4>World 4 - The Temple</h4><p>The Ancient Ruins are the final standard levels in Spelunky. Featuring Lava pits, crush traps, earlier traps, Worshipers of Olmec, amongst many other environmental hazards, this is a test of any true Spelunker's mettle.</p><h4>World 5 - Hell</h4><p>Hell is the true final world accessible through the secret second exit of Level 4-4 after fighting Olmec. The exit can only be accessed with the Book of the Dead, located in the City of Gold. Hell features horned Devils, Vampires, and Succubi who pose as damsels. Spike traps, lava pits and swinging spike balls are also plentiful. The final boss, King Yama, awaits in his throne room on level 5-4.</p><h3>Tunnel Man</h3><p>At the end of each world players will come across Tunnel Man, a miner who asks for items in exchange for building a shortcut that allows players to start at a given level. He will ask for items in a certain order, and players are only allowed to give him one set of items in each encounter. The requirements for each tunnel are as follows.</p><ul><li><b>Jungle</b>: 1 bomb, 1 rope, $10000</li><li><b>Ice Caves</b>: 2 bombs, 2 ropes, a shotgun</li><li><b>Temple</b>: 3 bombs, 3 ropes, the Golden Key (brought from the mines)</li></ul><h3>Special Levels</h3><h4>The Haunted Castle</h4><p>The haunted castle can be found on any level where a text displays "The dead are restless." It's a level filled with undead and the legendary Black Knight, who wields a unique shield.</p><h4>The Worm</h4><p>It's possible to gain access to the worm level in levels featuring a sticky red dot. When jumping on there while also holding a damsel, a gigantic worm will appear and swallow the player. In the level, players are making their way through said worm's innards.</p><h4>The Black Market</h4><p>The Black Market can be found through a secret entrance in the Jungle. The Udjat eye can be used to pinpoint it's exact location. It's a place filled with numerous shops and it's possible to get the ankh there.</p><h4>The Mothership</h4><p>A level that can be found in the Ice Caves, when a text displays "It feels like the fourth of July..." It's an alien mothership, guarded by the alien queen, who can be killed for the very powerful plasma cannon.</p><h4>The City of Gold</h4><p>The legendary City of Gold can be found in the temple after killing Anubis. It's a city that is literally made of gold. It contains the book of the dead, which can be used to eventually reach Hell.</p><h2>DLC</h2><p>On February 20th, 2013 two pieces of downloadable content were released for Spelunky on Xbox 360. One piece of DLC included 24 new maps for use in the Spelunky's deathmatch mode while the other provided an additional 8 characters for use in the game. Both pieces of DLC are priced at 160 <a href="/microsoft-points/3015-5685/" data-ref-id="3015-5685">Microsoft Points</a>. Developer Derek Yu stated on the Mossmouth forums that paid Spelunky DLC would be relegated to fun extras and that any additional content to the single player game such as new levels would be provided free of charge via an Xbox Live title update.</p><p>The later PC, PS3 and Vita releases of Spelunky included all the DLC content.</p><h2>Development</h2><p>Spelunky began as a freeware 2D rogue like platformer (now known as Spelunky Classic) developed and released by <a href="/derek-yu/3040-90931/" data-ref-id="3040-90931">Derek Yu</a> for the <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC</a> on September 1, 2009.</p><p>Soon after releasing the game, <a href="/derek-yu/3040-90931/" data-ref-id="3040-90931">Derek Yu</a> founded a small independent developer named <a href="/mossmouth-llc/3010-7356/" data-ref-id="3010-7356">Mossmouth</a> with <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/andy-hull/3040-103830/" data-ref-id="3040-103830">Andy Hull</a>, which then developed an updated version of Spelunky for the <a href="/xbox-360/3045-20/" data-ref-id="3045-20">Xbox 360</a> (via <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360-games-store/3045-86/" data-ref-id="3045-86">Xbox 360 Games Store</a>). It was published by <a href="/microsoft-studios/3010-340/" data-ref-id="3010-340">Microsoft</a> on July 4th, 2012 for 1200 MSP (USD$15). Along with redone high-definition graphics and advanced graphical effects, the update includes local multiplayer (in both the traditional "adventure" mode and a new competitive "deathmatch" mode, which is a series of <a href="/last-man-standing/3015-4788/" data-ref-id="3015-4788">"last man standing"</a> bouts in similar vein to the <a href="/bomberman/3025-67/" data-ref-id="3025-67">Bomberman</a> series) for up to four simultaneous players and/or bots, a brand new soundtrack, online <a href="/leaderboard/3015-30/" data-ref-id="3015-30">leaderboards</a>, and 20 <a href="/achievements/3015-29/" data-ref-id="3015-29">achievements</a> (worth 400 Gamerscore).</p><h2>PC System Requirements</h2><ul><li><strong>OS: </strong>Microsoft® Windows® XP / Vista / 7 / 8</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core 2 Duo 2.8GHz or equivalent processor</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2 GB RAM</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> 3D graphics card</li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 9.0c</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong> 200 MB available space</li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> Xbox 360 Controller or equivalent supported</li></ul>]]></description>

It was later released for the <a href="/mac/3045-17/" data-ref-id="3045-17">Mac</a> (via Steam on November 18, 2011), <a href="/linux/3045-152/" data-ref-id="3045-152">Linux</a> (first as part of some early <a href="/humble-bundle/3015-6612/" data-ref-id="3015-6612">Humble Bundles</a>, then later via Steam on November 5, 2013), and the <a href="/playstation-network/3015-2623/" data-ref-id="3015-2623">PlayStation Network</a> (for both the <a href="/playstation-4/3045-146/" data-ref-id="3045-146">PlayStation 4</a> and <a href="/playstation-vita/3045-129/" data-ref-id="3045-129">PlayStation Vita</a> on October 6, 2015). After originally being announced for WiiWare as one of the original release platforms and then canceled due to file size limitations, it at last received a Nintendo-release on <a href="/wii-u/3045-139/" data-ref-id="3045-139">Wii U</a> ported by <a href="/blitworks/3010-9146/" data-ref-id="3010-9146">BlitWorks</a> in early 2016.</p><p>It follows the titular <a href="../../meat-boy/94-10939/" rel="nofollow">Meat Boy</a>, a "boy without skin," as he attempts to rescue his girlfriend <a href="../../bandage-girl/94-10940/" rel="nofollow">Bandage Girl</a> from the menacing <a href="../../dr-fetus/94-15922/" rel="nofollow">Dr. Fetus</a> while avoiding a variety of deadly obstacles (most commonly <a href="/saw-blade/3055-502/" data-ref-id="3055-502">sawblades</a>, <a href="/missile/3055-74/" data-ref-id="3055-74">missiles</a>, and <a href="/laser/3055-140/" data-ref-id="3055-140">laser beams</a>). The game is known for its tricky <a href="/masocore/3015-1165/" data-ref-id="3015-1165">"trial and error" gameplay</a>, where players must use precise controls and an infinite amount of lives (with quick restarts) to clear each short level (filled with platforming puzzles of increasing difficulty) as fast as they can.</p><p>Like <a href="../../alien-hominid/61-17452/" rel="nofollow">Alien Hominid</a>, the concept for Super Meat Boy began as a <a href="/flash-game-origin/3015-6521/" data-ref-id="3015-6521">free online game made in Adobe Flash</a> for <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/" rel="nofollow">Newgrounds</a>. This game, originally called <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/463241" rel="nofollow">Meat Boy</a>, was released on October 5, 2008, followed by a <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/472826" rel="nofollow">map pack</a>. Super Meat Boy references other games and videos from the Newgrounds community, as well as the indie game scene at large (including <a href="../../n/61-13373/" rel="nofollow">N</a>, <a href="/aquaria/3030-6630/" data-ref-id="3030-6630">Aquaria</a>, <a href="/vvvvvv/3030-29745/" data-ref-id="3030-29745">VVVVVV</a>, <a href="../../i-wanna-be-the-guy/61-22845/" rel="nofollow">I Wanna Be The Guy</a>, and <a href="/braid/3030-20716/" data-ref-id="3030-20716">Braid</a>). The game's development process was featured in the 2012 documentary <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_Game:_The_Movie" rel="nofollow">Indie Game: The Movie</a></em>.</p><p>While the XBLA version was the first one released (as part of Microsoft's <a href="/game-feast-2010/3015-5905/" data-ref-id="3015-5905">Game Feast 2010</a> promotion) and includes <a href="/avatar-awards/3015-3749/" data-ref-id="3015-3749">avatar awards</a>, the Steam version added more achievements (including challenges such as clearing all the levels in each world consecutively without dying, clearing bonus levels, and unlocking new characters), a fully-functional level editor (complete with an in-game level portal), and a new cast of platform-exclusive characters (most notably the <a href="/headcrab/3015-230/" data-ref-id="3015-230">Headcrab</a> from the <a href="/half-life/3025-293/" data-ref-id="3025-293">Half-Life</a> series). The PSN version, released near the game's fifth anniversary (and originally free for <a href="/playstation-plus/3015-5817/" data-ref-id="3015-5817">PlayStation Plus</a> subscribers), features a brand new soundtrack (due to <a href="/danny-baranowsky/3040-99995/" data-ref-id="3040-99995">the original composer</a> declining a new licensing deal) featuring Ridiculon (of <a href="/the-binding-of-isaac-rebirth/3030-40865/" data-ref-id="3030-40865">The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth</a> fame), David Scatliffe (of <a href="/hotline-miami/3030-39452/" data-ref-id="3030-39452">Hotline Miami</a> fame), and <a href="/laura-shigihara/3040-97575/" data-ref-id="3040-97575">Laura Shigihara</a> (of <a href="/plants-vs-zombies/3030-25709/" data-ref-id="3030-25709">Plants vs. Zombies</a> fame).</p><p><a href="/digital-rights-management/3015-1704/" data-ref-id="3015-1704">DRM</a>-free versions for the PC, Mac, and Linux were also released through the <a href="/humble-bundle/3015-6612/" data-ref-id="3015-6612">Humble Store</a> (also including keys for the Steam version). It also received a limited-edition retail release (titled <em>Super Meat Boy: Ultra Edition</em>), featuring an art booklet, mini-poster, and digital soundtrack.</p><p>The game will receive a touch-based sequel, titled <a href="/super-meat-boy-forever/3030-47680/" data-ref-id="3030-47680">Super Meat Boy: Forever</a>, for <a href="/iphone/3045-96/" data-ref-id="3045-96">iOS devices</a>, <a href="/android/3045-123/" data-ref-id="3045-123">Android devices</a>, and PC (via Steam).

Navigation of these obstacles requires extremely precise timing to pass. Failure means instant death and a quick restart from the beginning of the level. The player is given an infinite amount of lives and near-instantaneous respawns, but Meat Boy leaves a trail of blood to mark where he has been and what obstacles previously killed him. When a regular level is completed, a <a href="/instant-replay/3015-45/" data-ref-id="3015-45">replay</a> showcases every attempt within the level simultaneously.</p><p>Characters have two abilities at their disposal: a <a href="/jump/3015-379/" data-ref-id="3015-379">jump</a> button and an ability button. For Meat Boy (and most other characters), pressing the ability button engages sprinting. Some characters sprint automatically and replace the ability button with another power, such as <a href="/tim/3005-5730/" data-ref-id="3005-5730">Tim's</a> ability to rewind time or <a href="/viridian/3005-16930/" data-ref-id="3005-16930">Viridian's</a> ability to inverse his own personal gravity. To keep the difficulty in check, the game features extremely precise controls. Quickly tapping the jump button performs a small hop, while holding down the jump button performs a tall leap. Players can also stick to the wall (which may either slow their descent or slightly continue their ascent) and press the jump button again for a <a href="/wall-jump/3015-5/" data-ref-id="3015-5">wall jump</a>. Some unlockable characters have special jumping abilities, such as <a href="/the-kid/3005-16987/" data-ref-id="3005-16987">the Kid's</a> ability to double jump and <a href="/jill/3005-16969/" data-ref-id="3005-16969">Jill's</a> ability to stall her descent.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1283745-supermeatboy_release_2010_01_11_01_00_17_28.png" data-ref-id="1300-1283745" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1283745-supermeatboy_release_2010_01_11_01_00_17_28.png" data-ref-id="1300-1283745"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="1283745-supermeatboy_release_2010_01_11_01_00_17_28.png" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/26/1283745-supermeatboy_release_2010_01_11_01_00_17_28.png"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/26/1283745-supermeatboy_release_2010_01_11_01_00_17_28.png" alt="1283745-supermeatboy_release_2010_01_11_01_00_17_28.png"></noscript></a></figure><p>Over the course of the game, new mechanics are introduced and obstacles become more complex. These include rising tides of lava, portals, magnetic fields, fans, lava rocks, and eventually enemies that hunt down the player character. All obstacles will result in instantaneous death upon contact. The "<a href="/bosses/3015-229/" data-ref-id="3015-229">bosses</a>" are equally indestructible; instead of actually fighting them, these levels require players to navigate difficult puzzles under time restraints until a <a href="/cutscene/3015-22/" data-ref-id="3015-22">cutscene</a> is triggered.</p><p>Players can also collect bandages scattered around certain levels to unlock characters and certain levels. In order for the player to keep Bandages, they must collect them and successfully reach the exit in one attempt. Some bandages require specific characters and all are difficult to collect, especially in the purple Warp Zones, where players must not only collect the Bandage, but clear each of the three levels with a limited number of lives.</p><h2>Levels</h2><p>Super Meat Boy features five main worlds, each with forty regular levels. The initial twenty levels are referred to as the "Light World". If the player is able to clear a Light World level under its par time, they will be able to access the "Dark World" counterpart (which shares the same basic geometry, but has a different appearance and increased difficulty). Each Light World version of the five main worlds also include a boss level, which must be completed in order to progress to the next world. Boss levels are unlocked after the player beats 17 out of the 20 Light World levels.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1406229-supermeatboy_esrb_nyrt_720p30_st_66.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1406229" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1406229-supermeatboy_esrb_nyrt_720p30_st_66.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1406229"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Meat Boy entering a Warp Zone.

"></noscript></a><figcaption>Meat Boy entering a Warp Zone. </figcaption></figure><p>Along the way, players can also find purple <a href="/warp-zone/3015-804/" data-ref-id="3015-804">Warp Zones</a> within certain levels. These portals vanish after a set period of time during the level attempt, though reaching these portals makes the Warp Zone available in the level selection screen. Entering a Warp Zone will transport Meat Boy (regardless of which character reaches the warp zone) to a retro-themed zone which is notably difficult. Each zone comes with three levels that must be completed consecutively with a special version of Meat Boy. Bandages are found within these warp zones, but the player will only have three attempts per level to collect them and clear the Warp Zone. If Meat Boy dies during the final attempt at any level, all bandages found during the Warp Zone attempt will be reset, and the player will be kicked back to the level selection screen. Replays and par times are unavailable for Warp Zones.</p><p>Red Warp Zones function similarly to purple Warp Zones but are played instead with a secret character. There are no bandages in red warp zones but there are also unlimited lives. There are only five red warp zones, one in each of the main Light Worlds. Each main world also has a special "<a href="/glitch/3015-511/" data-ref-id="3015-511">glitch</a> zone", reached by getting to Bandage Girl while she is in a randomly occurring "glitch state". Glitch zones feature no bandages and only one level, which is typically longer and more difficult than any of the world's Warp Zones.</p><h3>Chapter 1: The Forest</h3><p><strong>Intro Cutscene Tribute:</strong> <a href="../../street-fighter-ii/61-243/" rel="nofollow">Street Fighter II: The World Warrior</a></p><p><strong>Boss:</strong> Lil' Slugger (giant walking chainsaw driven by Dr. Fetus)</p><p>The Forest introduces buzzsaws, static sawblade launchers, and impassable tiles that crumble away soon after the player touches it.</p><h3>Chapter 2: The Hospital</h3><p><strong>Intro Cutscene Tribute:</strong> <a href="../../castlevania/61-6673/" rel="nofollow">Castlevania</a></p><p><strong>Boss:</strong> <a href="/chad/3005-15923/" data-ref-id="3005-15923">C.H.A.D.</a> (mutated living abomination of blood and tissue)</p><p>The Hospital introduces fans, crawling slimes that stick to surfaces, floating enemies that bounce around aimlessly, piles of deadly needles, keys that unlock certain tiles, and timed laser beams.</p><h3>Chapter 3: The Salt Factory</h3><p><strong>Intro Cutscene Tribute:</strong> <a href="../../the-adventures-of-lolo/61-5026/" rel="nofollow">The Adventures of Lolo</a></p><p><strong>Boss:</strong> <a href="/brownie/3005-17017/" data-ref-id="3005-17017">Brownie</a></p><p>The Salt Factory introduces harmful salt, homing missile launchers, moving platforms, tiles that only crumble away after coming in to contact with a missile, and high-speed conveyor belts.</p><h3>Chapter 4: Hell</h3><p><strong>Intro Cutscene Tribute:</strong> <a href="../../ninja-gaiden/61-1653/" rel="nofollow">Ninja Gaiden</a></p><p><strong>Boss:</strong> <a href="/little-horn/3005-17018/" data-ref-id="3005-17018">Little Horn</a> (monster made of Meat Boy corpses)</p><p>Hell introduces lava pits (that sometimes rise), moving lava rocks, portals, rotating eyes that slowly lock on to the player while shooting laser beams, and demon homing missiles that split in to separate small missiles on impact.</p><h3>Chapter 5: Rapture</h3><p><strong>Intro Cutscene Tribute:</strong> <a href="../../mega-man-2/61-14026/" rel="nofollow">Mega Man 2</a></p><p><strong>Boss:</strong> Larrie's Lament (a group of enormous carnivorous worms)</p><p>Rapture introduces orbs that repulse the player, abominations (both running and flying) that head towards the player, and homing sawblade launchers.</p><h3>Chapter 6: The End</h3><p><strong>Intro Cutscene Tribute:</strong> <a href="/pokemon-redblue/3030-3966/" data-ref-id="3030-3966">Pokémon Red/Blue</a></p><p><strong>Boss:</strong> <a href="/dr-fetus/3005-15922/" data-ref-id="3005-15922">Dr. Fetus</a></p><p>Unlocked after completing Chapter 5, The End includes five regular levels (with both Light World and Dark World variations) that can only be played by Meat Boy and are designed to test the player's mastery of previous concepts.

      <deck><![CDATA[A Boy and His Blob, a two-dimensional puzzle-platformer has been referred to as "inspired by" and a "rebirth" of the now twenty-year-old original rather than a straightforward remake.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview <br /></h2><i>A Boy and His Blob</i>, a remake of the  classic puzzle-platformer for the <a data-ref-id="3055-2794" href="/nes/3055-2794/">            Nintendo Entertainment System</a>, was revealed in Nintendo Power on March 5th, 2009.<br /> <br />The new art style uses hand-painted backgrounds and hand drawn character models, paired with advanced lighting and visual effects. A greater emphasis is also put on the friendship and reliance on one another between the <a data-ref-id="3005-2680" href="/a-boy/3005-2680/">         Boy</a>, now with an even younger design, and the <a data-ref-id="3005-1188" href="/blobert/3005-1188/">        Blob</a> (who is not named "Blobert" as in the previous games).<br /><br />  A Virtual Console release of the original <a data-ref-id="3030-20314" href="/david-cranes-a-boy-and-his-blob-trouble-on-blobolonia/3030-20314/"> <i>A Boy and His Blob: Trouble on Blobonia</i></a> has also been rated by the ESRB, assumed to pique interest shortly prior to this full release.<br /><br /><h2>Development <br /></h2><i>A Boy and His Blob</i> is the brainchild of <a data-ref-id="3010-2294" href="/wayforward-technologies/3010-2294/">                WayForward Technology</a>'s Director,  Sean Velasco. Being a fan of the original property, he thought it was an idea which had a lot of potential the team could explore upon the completion of <a data-ref-id="3030-4237" href="/contra-4/3030-4237/"> <i>Contra 4</i></a>. They thought about refinements in gameplay they could take advantage of, coupled with the studio's fresh animation and presentation techniques, and particular strength for two-dimensional platform games. A pitch was made to <a data-ref-id="3010-370" href="/majesco-entertainment/3010-370/">                Majesco Entertainment</a> through Creative Director, <a data-ref-id="3040-80202" href="/matt-bozon/3040-80202/">                Matt Bozon</a> at E3 in 2008.<br /><br /> The series creator, <a data-ref-id="3040-29662" href="/david-crane/3040-29662/">                David Crane</a> is said to be with the team "in spirit" whenever they play the original game for reference, but is not involved with the project on a day-to-day basis.<br /><br /><h2>Story <br /></h2>The story starts out with the Blob crash-landing on Earth looking for someone to help him save his beloved home planet of Blobolonia. When The Boy meets the Blob, they begin their quest to dethrone an evil emperor who has taken over the peaceful planet of Blobolonia. Their first task is to travel through a forest on Earth, which contains some enemies which are presumed to be minions of the evil emperor. The pair then travels through a cave near a city, encountering more obstacles. Outside of the cave, the blob transforms into its rocket form and takes the boy to Blobolonia. The two trek through Blobolonia, finding increasingly bleak landscapes as they grow closer to a large castle, which is the center of the emperor's reign. After fighting through the castle, the boy and the blob defeat the emperor, freeing Blobolonia from his dark reign. The blob once again transforms into a rocket, returning the boy to his treehouse. In the nearby forest, the pair encounters a massive monster. After defeating it, the boy and blob part ways in a brief, but heartfelt cutscene. The blob transforms into a rocket to return to Blobolonia, and the boy is left to go on with his life. The story is not delivered through long-winded cutscenes, but rather subtle hints in the context of the world and interactions with characters, leaving a lot to interpretation in the same vein as  <a data-ref-id="3030-2980" href="/half-life/3030-2980/"> <i>Half-Life</i></a>. The ending has been described by the game's Producer, <a data-ref-id="3040-5073" href="/robb-alvey/3040-5073/">                Robb Alvey</a> as "touching".<br /><br /><h2>Gameplay <br /></h2> <figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1097602-bahb2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1097602" data-size="small" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1097602-bahb2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1097602"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5911/1097602-bahb2.jpg" alt="The Boy just floating along with Blob. "></a><figcaption>The Boy just floating along with Blob. </figcaption></figure> Like most 2-D puzzle-platformers, <i>A Boy and His Blob</i> has the player travel through various levels by solving puzzles. This is done by feeding Blob a variety of jelly beans. By feeding him these treats, Blob transforms into one of 15 different objects (anvil, trampoline, parachute, etc.), allowing the Boy to get to points he couldn't get to before. When holding down the Nunchuck's C button a radial menu pops with the kinds of jelly beans available. With the wanted bean chosen, the player throws the bean by pressing B. The player may also hold it down to be able to more accurately throw the bean where they want it go. Using the Z button causes the Boy to call for the Blob. This call transforms Blob back into his normal blobby self.  <br /> <br />Although the game has many types of beans, not all the jelly beans are available for each level. At the start of the level, the Boy only has the specific kinds of jelly beans that are needed to solve the puzzles. With that said, one level may see the Boy with three beans, while another may see the whole radial menu filled up.   <br /> <br />Each stage contains 3 chests that can be found and eaten by blob, and then regurgitated once the duo have returned to the tree house. If you manage to find all 3 in a given stage, then a bonus challenge stage will be unlocked. Upon completion of the bonus stage, concept art or videos will be unlocked for your viewing pleasure. Finding these chests is not required though, only navigating the boy and his blob safely to the end of the level.<br />  <b> <br /></b><h2><b>Miscellaneous Information</b></h2><b></b><ul class="plain-list"><li>The game runs at 480p in 16:9.</li></ul><ul class="plain-list"><li>There is a button dedicated solely to hugging. An unlockable video shows a reference for the animation, with a young boy hugging a propped up sleeping bag.</li><li>The Blob hates being poked with a stick!</li></ul>]]></description>

The game was first announced in February 2007 through a full-page advertisement in the Japanese gaming magazine <i>Famitsu</i>. It was shown publicly for the first time in trailer form at <a href="/e3-2009/3015-3244/" data-ref-id="3015-3244">E3 2009</a>.</p><p>At E3, The Last Guardian was announced as an exclusive to the <a href="/playstation-3/3045-35/" data-ref-id="3045-35"> PlayStation 3</a>. Very few concrete details were released about the title, but the artwork indicates that it would share similarities with the visuals in Team Ico's previous works,<a href="/ico/3030-9638/" data-ref-id="3030-9638"> Ico</a> and <a href="/shadow-of-the-colossus/3030-6522/" data-ref-id="3030-6522"> Shadow of the Colossus</a>. It is not known if The Last Guardian is set within the same world as the previous Team Ico games.</p><p>The Last Guardian was last shown to the public in a trailer at TGS 2010. Since then, it has been met with extensive delays. Though it was originally announced as a PS3 title, at E3 2015 it was re-revealed as now being a Playstation 4 game.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>From the E3 2009 trailer, it can be deduced that, as was the case with Ico, the game will again feature a young boy as the main character; in this case, one who will interact with a large creature named "<a href="/toriko/3005-16399/" data-ref-id="3005-16399">Toriko</a>." The creature has purposely been designed as an amalgamation of several different types of animals, as designer <a href="/fumito-ueda/3040-89582/" data-ref-id="3040-89582">Fumito Ueda</a> feels this will create a greater sense of empathy in the player. The developers have stated that player's shouldn't expect the creature to be too intelligent and that luring it onwards may be an important aspect of gameplay.</p><h2>Development</h2><p>In March 2009 at the Game Developers Conference '09, Ueda stated during a Q&amp;A session that "it [the new game] might be similar to what's been done," and "the essence of the game is rather close to 'Ico.'"</p><p>On May 19 2009, PlayStationLifestyle.net released a several images and a video of the studio's newest project. Tentatively titled 'Project Trico', the footage began with the scene shown previously in the first image. It showed a boy together with a giant feathered beast traversing vast temple ruins, the architecture similar in style to both Ico and Shadow of the Colossus. It was revealed to be old footage however, shown internally within Sony.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-ref-id="1300-1043394" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3068/1043394-tlg.jpg" data-ratio="1.7777777777778" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:177.8%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3068/1043394-tlg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1043394"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3068/1043394-tlg.jpg" alt="1043394-tlg.jpg"></a></figure><p>On June 1 2009, the game was officially revealed at Sony's E3 press conference, with the first trailer being shown. It was an updated version of the footage that had been leaked previously, with the scenes slightly edited and now showing a lot more polish, in addition to completely new scenes. The game's title was revealed to be 'The Last Guardian.' New screenshots were officially released too. Sony Computer Entertainment announced at E3 that The Last Guardian is a 2010 release, and Ueda declined to go into further specifics, other than to say "there is definitely a reason why we are announcing this when we are."</p><p>On September 24 2009, The Last Guardian made a highly-anticipated appearance at Tokyo Game Show on the first day, albeit in limited form. While there was still no playable demo present, a new trailer was shown, revealing a few more scenes of gameplay. Another batch of screenshots were also released, in addition to <a href="/the-last-guardian-tgs-09-interview/2300-1416/" data-ref-id="2300-1416"> a short behind-the-scenes look</a> at the game's development featuring Ueda.</p><p>At TGS 2010, Ueda announced a late 2011 release for the game, but by April 2011, a post on the EU PlayStation blog revealed a delay to both The Last Guardian and <a href="/the-ico-shadow-of-the-colossus-collection/3030-32696/" data-ref-id="3030-32696">The Ico &amp; Shadow of the Colossus Collection</a>. The reason provided was "to provide more challenging and better quality of content to users and to fulfill First Party Studio’s obligations". </p><p>As of late 2011, Ueda is no longer a full-time employee of Sony Computer Entertainment. He has since joined a company called Bossa Studios, but it has been stated that he is continuing to work on The Last Guardian in a freelance capacity.</p><p>On February 13, 2013, <a href="/shuhei-yoshida/3040-63461/" data-ref-id="3040-63461">Shuhei Yoshida</a> announced a significant amount of work on The Last Guardian had to be completely redone. “At one point we felt that it would be produced for a certain time period. That was the time we prematurely talked about the launch window. But it turned out the technical issues are much harder to solve. So the engineering team had to go back and re-do some of the work they had done.”</p><p>On June 11, 2013, at E3, <a href="/jack-tretton/3040-700/" data-ref-id="3040-700">Jack Tretton</a> commented that development of The Last Guardian is "on hiatus"; phrasing that suggests that the game is no longer in development. However, Yoshida later commented to Kotaku's Stephen Totilo and clarified that the game is still in active development and requested that the public continue to have patience.</p><p>On June 7, 2014, the website IGN reported that The Last Guardian had been cancelled, citing an "internal source" that spoke with IGN Russia. This news was quickly refuted by <a href="/scott-rohde/3040-30099/" data-ref-id="3040-30099">Scott Rohde</a> of Sony Worldwide Studios on Twitter. IGN later backtracked, updating <a href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/08/the-last-guardian-cancelled" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">their article</a> to reflect the conflicting reports they received.</p><p>On June 15, 2015, at E3, The Last Guardian finally made a reappearance at Sony's Press Conference. Sony showed <a href="/videos/e3-2015-the-last-guardian-it-s-real/2300-10308/" data-ref-id="2300-10308">a brand new trailer</a> which featured gameplay of the game on the Playstation 4 and a release date of 2016.</p>]]></description>

      <deck><![CDATA[A level-based side scrolling action game by Tecmo. This is the linear 1986 Arcade version, which was converted for the Commodore 64, Atari Lynx, Sega Master System and others.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p>Rygar is a side-scrolling action game from Tecmo, featuring a warrior with a combat yo-yo (named the <a href="/diskarmor/3055-1418/" data-ref-id="3055-1418">Diskarmor</a>). This nameless Legendary Warrior sets out to defeat the eponymous warlord Rygar (or Ligar) in order to save his homeland from destruction.</p><p>It was originally released in the Arcades in 1986 and received a handful of home system conversions. These include the Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, Atari Lynx and ZX Spectrum. A Japan-only Master System version, named Argus no Juujiken, was released in 1988. </p><p>A game named <a href="/rygar/3030-10397/" data-ref-id="3030-10397">Rygar</a> was released on the NES, but like other arcade-to-NES games such as <a href="/strider/3030-12558/" data-ref-id="3030-12558">Strider</a> and <a href="/bionic-commando/3030-7860/" data-ref-id="3030-7860">Bionic Commando</a>, Rygar on the NES is a full-fledged action-adventure game with an open-world to explore.</p><p>Rygar was eventually rebooted for the PS2 with <a href="/rygar-the-legendary-adventure/3030-14034/" data-ref-id="3030-14034">Rygar: The Legendary Adventure</a> in 2002. <a href="/tecmo-classic-arcade/3030-328/" data-ref-id="3030-328">Tecmo Classic Arcade</a>, released for the Xbox in 2005, contains the original Arcade version of Rygar. The Arcade version of Rygar was also released on the Wii's <a href="/virtual-console/3015-2925/" data-ref-id="3015-2925">Virtual Console</a>, and again for the PS4 as part of Hamster's <a href="/arcade-archives/3025-3081/" data-ref-id="3025-3081">Arcade Archives</a> range.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Rygar features a series of levels where the player must reach the end of the stage before the time limit runs out. The player is armed with a large disc weapon which is attached to the character's wrist by a short chain. The weapon can be upgraded to a larger version during the game.</p><p>The game is notable in that despite having a time limit, the game does not automatically end when the timer expires. Instead, a demonic monster appears that will actively pursue (and usually kill) the player as they race for the exit.</p><p>The arcade version of Rygar contains 27 stages, after which the game presents a short, celebratory sequence and ends the game.</p>]]></description>

After acquiring one of the enemy's advanced combat suits, Dallas easily dispatches the hostile troops and their support helicopter. However, his suit is disabled remotely by Commander Lucius, the leader of the insurgent radical-leftist "Progressive Restoration" army, before the vice president is subsequently killed inside his vehicle by an explosion.</p><p>The bulk of the game occurs in the Olympic Mountains of <a href="/washington/3035-2434/" data-ref-id="3035-2434">Washington</a> state. College student Claire Duncan travels into the wilderness area along with new boyfriend <a href="/jason-fleming/3005-11149/" data-ref-id="3005-11149">Jason Fleming</a>, where the pair plan to explore a cave that Claire recalls from her childhood. Claire scouts ahead, prompting Jason to follow after her when she does not respond to his calls. After locating Claire's discarded climbing gear, Jason discovers a metal walkway leading to a sealed door embedded in the cave wall. As he searches the area, Jason witnesses Claire being taken prisoner by several armed men in strange uniforms, who drag her through the door.</p><p>Jason enters the unlocked door, which leads to a series of underground corridors equipped with automated security cameras.

In turn, attributes like accuracy, precision or stamina, are increased automatically. A unique attribute of Shadow Complex's XP system is the idea of XP multipliers. If the player performs certain actions (head shots, melee attacks) a multiplier is added for every successful move, increasing the overall XP reward. Shadow Complex also rewards the player for defeating larger enemies like bosses by exploiting their weaknesses or attacking them in clever ways. While all enemies can be defeated simply by continuous shooting for extended periods of time, the game "knows" when this is taking place and gives less XP.</p><p>Additionally, uncovering squares of the map grants more experience than killing enemies. However, acquiring collectibles grants the most experience of all. This means that there is more incentive to explore and play through the game multiple times.</p><h3>Challenge Rooms</h3><p><a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/challenges/3015-1925/" data-ref-id="3015-1925">Challenge rooms</a> are included to hone the player's skills, all with accompanying online <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/leaderboard/3015-30/" data-ref-id="3015-30"> leaderboards</a>. In each challenge room, the player can earn a bronze, silver, gold, or platinum medal, depending on how well they have completed it.</p><h3>Achievements</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39552/1084191-sc24.png" data-ref-id="1300-1084191" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.56426332288401" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39552/1084191-sc24.png" data-ref-id="1300-1084191"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="The extensive map." class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/39552/1084191-sc24.png"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/39552/1084191-sc24.png" alt="The extensive map."></noscript></a><figcaption>The extensive map.</figcaption></figure><p>Embracing <a href="/metroid/3030-21761/" data-ref-id="3030-21761"> Metroid</a> and other similar games' traditions of <a href="/speedrun/3015-179/" data-ref-id="3015-179"> speed running</a> and <a href="/sequence-breaking/3015-980/" data-ref-id="3015-980"> sequence breaking</a>, Chair has endeavored to add multiple achievements for these feats. The most difficult feats are not in the form of achievements, but rather in the form of "master challenges" that exist only within the game - a way to give achievement lovers more easy achievements while also giving the hardcore players a standardized set of goals.</p><h2>Remastered Version</h2><p>A <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/shadowcomplex/" rel="nofollow">remastered</a> version of the game was announced at The Game Awards 2015 for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC.

The game in its current iteration is a fully redesigned relaunch of the original version, which was released in 2010. The relaunch, subtitled "A Realm Reborn" was released on August 27, 2013 on <a href="/playstation-3/3045-35/" data-ref-id="3045-35">PlayStation 3</a> and <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">PC</a>.

An OS X version will be available alongside the release of the game's first expansion on June 23, 2015.</p><p>The games first expansion pack, <a href="/final-fantasy-xiv-heavensward/3030-48901/" data-ref-id="3030-48901">Heavensward</a>, is scheduled for release on June 23rd, 2015, and will bring many new regions and area, 3 new jobs, flying mounts and more.</p><h2>Original Release and Reaction</h2><p>Final Fantasy XIV "Version 1.0" began its first stage of alpha testing on March 10th, 2010, and entered the second stage on June 10th, 2010. Closed beta testing began on July 13th, 2010, and the game's open beta started on September 2nd, 2010. The game launched with a Limited Collector's Edition on September 22nd, 2010, and the standard edition launched on September 30, 2010 worldwide on <a href="/pc/3045-94/" data-ref-id="3045-94">Windows</a> PC platforms. The game was not released as a part of Square Enix's <a href="/playonline/3015-1540/" data-ref-id="3015-1540">PlayOnline</a> service that Final Fantasy XI operates under, but under a new "Square Enix Account" system planned for use with all future Square Enix online titles.</p><p>Upon its release, Final Fantasy XIV was savaged by critics and players alike for dull, tedious, and outdated gameplay. The response was so severe that Square Enix president <a href="/youichi-wada/3040-48566/" data-ref-id="3040-48566">Youichi Wada</a> publicly apologized for the game's quality. The game's development team was reorganized and the free trial period was extended while the company made efforts to improve the title.</p><p>The PlayStation 3 version of the game was put on indefinite hold, while the title's many faults were addressed.</p><h2>A New Producer/Director and A Realm Reborn</h2><p>On December 10, 2010, a massive shakeup occurred amongst the development and planning teams of Final Fantasy XIV, in wake of the game's extremely negative launch.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1665/2305524-a_realm_reborn.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-2305524" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.56231884057971" data-width="480" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1665/2305524-a_realm_reborn.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-2305524"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1665/2305524-a_realm_reborn.jpeg" alt="2305524-a_realm_reborn.jpeg"></a></figure><p><a href="/naoki-yoshida/3040-99324/" data-ref-id="3040-99324">Naoki Yoshida</a>, a relative unknown amongst fans of Square Enix titles, stepped in to the role of both Producer and Director, replacing the positions held by <a href="/hiromichi-tanaka/3040-61873/" data-ref-id="3040-61873">Hiromichi Tanaka</a> and <a href="/nobuaki-komoto/3040-92945/" data-ref-id="3040-92945">Nobuaki Komoto</a> respectively. With this and other staff changes made at key positions, an air of change began in the development of the title. Yoshida opened lines of communication with the players through players polls, and new official forums. This kind of communication with players was unheard of in the series' previous MMO, Final Fantasy XI. Player feedback has became a top priority, and since his arrival, many game mechanics that players found arduous and non-friendly were removed (Fatigue system, Physical levels, etc.) or given totally new roles (Guildleves changing from the main crux of the game's content, to being a method of easier solo-play).</p><p>While many of the changes to the original game were welcomed by the game's player base, there were many other changes that the team could not implement due to limitations in the original game engine and servers. So, it was announced in late November 2011 that the game would be completely rebuilt from the ground up, and become an entirely new client. This project was originally named Final Fantasy XIV: Version 2.0<i>.</i></p><p>The introduction of Version 2.0 brought numerous elements into play that were not possible in the original game. These include, but are not limited to:</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1665/2305528-00_final_fantasy_xiv_a_realm_reborn_screenshot_014.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2305528" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1665/2305528-00_final_fantasy_xiv_a_realm_reborn_screenshot_014.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2305528"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="2305528-00_final_fantasy_xiv_a_realm_reborn_screenshot_014.jpg" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1665/2305528-00_final_fantasy_xiv_a_realm_reborn_screenshot_014.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1665/2305528-00_final_fantasy_xiv_a_realm_reborn_screenshot_014.jpg" alt="2305528-00_final_fantasy_xiv_a_realm_reborn_screenshot_014.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><ul><li>A completely new game engine based off of Square Enix's Luminous engine, allowing for better scaling of graphics, and therefore lowering the games' high PC requirements.</li><li>Completely new geography to the maps, eliminating the original maps' repetitive nature.</li><li>New party search feature to allow for cross-server play.</li><li>New player estates, including linkshell/guild housing.</li><li>New main scenario.</li><li>New UI for PC and a controller friendly UI for PlayStation 3, including the support of add-ons for both versions.</li><li>Player vs. Player content.</li><li>Delivery Services via moogles.</li><li>Players being able to jump while traveling on foot, or on chocobos.</li></ul><p>On November 11th, 2012, the original version of the game was shut down, and a CG trailer showed the conclusion of the "Seventh Umbral Era" storyline which is being used to explain the massive changes in the world which came with the game's relaunch. Now labeled "Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn", the new game client went through extensive alpha/beta testing through the first half of 2013.</p><p>Unlike the original release's beta test, where nearly no feedback was taken into account, the game underwent a great many changes while in beta testing due to player feedback.</p><p>The relaunched Final Fantasy XIV on sale August 27, 2013 for Windows and PlayStation 3 in Japan, North America and Europe simultaneously to nearly universal acclaim and praise for the complete turnaround the title made from the original release.</p><p> </p><h2>The Armoury System</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4086/1166042-final_fantasy_xiv_2009_10_08_09_19.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1166042" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.382099827883" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:138.2%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4086/1166042-final_fantasy_xiv_2009_10_08_09_19.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1166042"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="A Blacksmith" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4086/1166042-final_fantasy_xiv_2009_10_08_09_19.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4086/1166042-final_fantasy_xiv_2009_10_08_09_19.jpg" alt="A Blacksmith"></noscript></a><figcaption>A Blacksmith</figcaption></figure><p>The Armoury is a system vaguely reminiscent the <a href="/job-system/3015-298/" data-ref-id="3015-298">job system</a> used in previous Final Fantasy games. Rather than gaining experience and levels, however, this <a href="/">class</a> system is tied to weapons. Each weapon type represents a different character class (for example, if your character picks up a one-handed sword, he becomes a <a href="/">Gladiator</a>). Selecting a weapon will grant you basic abilities for the class tied to it. As you fight with that weapon and use the class abilities it grants, your skill with the weapon will increase, granting you new abilities. At any time, you can change your weapon, switching classes in the process. For example, you've been carrying a staff since the start of your adventuring career and you've earned powerful skill as a Conjurer. Deciding to learn the way of the sword, you put your staff away and pull out a longsword. Now you can use your sword for basic attacks, and as you increase in skill, learn more powerful sword-based attacks. And, while using your sword, you can still cast most spells you learned as a Conjurer. Put the sword away and take out your staff, and you're once again a Conjurer.</p><h3>Disciplines</h3><p>Disciplines are the different paths of activity and skill that an adventurer may devote himself to. Using the Armoury system, one may switch between classes under all disciplines.</p><h4>Disciples of War</h4><p><strong>Archer (Job Advancement: Bard)</strong></p><p>The <a href="/archer/3015-3355/" data-ref-id="3015-3355">Archer</a> is a ranged combat specialist, highly skilled with the <a href="/">bow</a> and able to fall back on slings and rocks if they run out of arrows. Traditionally, the <a href="/elezen/3015-4930/" data-ref-id="3015-4930">Elezen</a> and <a href="/miqote/3015-4931/" data-ref-id="3015-4931">Miqo'te</a> are considered to be the most skillful Archers. Effectiveness with this class will depend on a player's expertise in positioning and arrow-type selection.</p><p><strong>Lancer (Job Advancement: Dragoon)</strong></p><p>The Lancer is a melee fighter skilled at using <a href="/">polearm</a> weapons such as lances and pikes. Able to attack from a relatively safe distance due to the length of their weapon, lancers are also skilled at throwing javelins at long range. These abilities make them an ideal combat support class.</p><p><strong>Gladiator (Job Advancement: Paladin)</strong></p><p>Gladiators are skilled in the use of all one-handed blades, including both melee weapons and <a href="/">throwing knives</a>. They can either use shields in their off hand or focus all their energy on their sword arm. A Gladiator is a great front-line fighter and defender, with the ability to hold an enemy's attention.</p><p><strong>Marauder (Job Advancement: Warrior)</strong></p><p>A combat specialist focusing on the two-handed <a href="/">great-axe</a>, the marauder is a fearsome fighter who is able to supplement their arsenal with throwing axes. Brute force is their greatest attribute, and timing and distance will be essential to their effectiveness in combat.</p><p><strong>Pugilist (Job Advancement: Monk)</strong></p><p>This master of close-combat is formidable even when unarmed, but they are known to use different types of <a href="/">fist</a> weapons to augment their arsenal. The Pugilist can alter their stance to focus on either attack or defense, and counter their lack of range with excellent maneuverability.</p><p><strong>Rogue (Job Advancement: Ninja)</strong></p><p>Available in the upcoming 2.4 patch, Rogues specialize in dual-welding weapons. Armed with daggers and knives, the Rogue is able to dish out the fastest damage possible. Rogues will be able to applies a wide variety of poisons to their weapons and use Ninjutsu abilites.</p><h4>Disciples of Magic</h4><p><strong>Conjurer (Job Advancement: White Mage)</strong></p><p>Conjurers use a combination of healing <a href="/">spells</a> and elemental magic attacks. They use wands or canes to focus energy from the world around them and weave it into spells. Their intimacy with all types of elemental energy enables them to easily switch between offensive and defensive magic.</p><p><strong>Thaumaturge (Job Advancement: Black Mage)</strong></p><p>A Thaumaturge uses the power of darkness to buff allies and enfeeble enemies along with doing great darkness magic damage. They draw on the energy within themselves and channel magic through scepters and <a href="/">staffs</a>. Their powers of destruction can rival even the Disciples of War.</p><p><strong>Arcanist (Job Advancement: Summoner and Scholar)</strong></p><p>Armed with grimoire books, and faithful sidekick Carbuncle by their side, Arcanists use gemstones to set their elemental alignment, and can cast powerful damage-over-time spells.</p><h4>Disciples of the Land</h4><p><strong>Botanist</strong></p><p>The Botanist is a master of procuring resources from all forms of <a href="/">plant life</a>. They use a <a href="/">hatchet</a> to harvest from trees, grasses, and other plants, and many other disciplines rely on them for supplies.</p><p><strong>Miner</strong></p><p>Along with being able to harvest valuable <a href="/">minerals</a>, a Miner can also throw rocks and debilitate their enemies with mineral compositions. Their main tool is the <a href="/">pickaxe</a>, and they are able to take on a broad spectrum of jobs, from small- to large-scale.</p><p><strong>Fisher</strong></p><p>Fishers use a <a href="/">fishing rod</a> to harvest the realm's aquatic creatures, and sell them to those in other disciplines. Many factors influence how successful they will be in different areas, and the dangerous spots they may need to travel to fish necessitates protection from more combat-oriented classes.</p><h4>Disciples of the Hand</h4><p><strong>Alchemist</strong></p><p>Alchemists are masters of both science and nature, capable of distilling ordinary materials into wondrous concoctions. They use an alembic to distill and combine materials into various powerful and trans-formative substances.</p><p><strong>Blacksmith</strong></p><p>Blacksmiths smelt metal ingots and use them to <a href="/">craft</a> armor, weapons, and even guns. This work is always in high demand all over Eorzea due to the need for all fighters to keep their weapons in good repair. They have many tools related to crafting and repairing weapons.</p><p><strong>Culinarian</strong></p><p>Culinarians use a vast array of ingredients to <a href="/">cook</a> delicious meals that help adventurers maintain their strength on the battlefield. Their main tool is the skillet, which they use to fulfill many different recipes.</p><p><strong>Leatherworker</strong></p><p>Tanners are able to boil and dye <a href="/">pelts and skins</a>, and use them to craft leather armor and clothing. There is a large demand for these products, and the Leatherworker uses a headknife for many of these processes.</p><p><strong>Weaver</strong></p><p>Weavers make threads and use them to make various types of clothing. Their main tool is the <a href="/">needle</a>, and they must keep up with current trends in clothing to stay successful.</p><p><strong>Armorer</strong></p><p>An Armorer's main skill is crafting many pieces of metal armor, whether plate or chain, and their main tool is the raising <a href="/">hammer</a>. There is enough specialization in requisite techniques to separate this profession from Blacksmithing.</p><p><strong>Carpenter</strong></p><p>The Carpenter's main tool is the <a href="/">handsaw</a>, which they use to create various wares. They are attuned to the fine differences between types of wood, and bring these traits out in any craft they produce.</p><p><strong>Goldsmith</strong></p><p>Goldsmiths use precious metals and <a href="/">gems</a> to craft accessories and decorate weapons, armor, and tools. Their main tool is the chaser hammer, and they must constantly watch <a href="/economy/3015-2425/" data-ref-id="3015-2425">economic trends</a> to make sure they get a <a href="/supply-and-demand/3015-2905/" data-ref-id="3015-2905">return on their investment</a> in expensive materials.</p><h3>Jobs</h3><p>An evolution of the Armoury system, the Job System is where any of the Disciples of War or Magic classes, when meeting certain requirements, can complete quests to become classic jobs in the Final Fantasy series.</p><p>The jobs currently available are:</p><ul><li><strong>Warrior</strong> - Unlocked through Marauder</li><li><strong>Monk</strong> - Unlocked through Pugilist</li><li><strong>White Mage</strong> - Unlocked through Conjurer</li><li><strong>Black Mage</strong> - Unlocked through Thaumaturge</li><li><strong>Bard</strong> - Unlocked through Archer</li><li><strong>Dragoon</strong> - Unlocked through Lancer</li><li><strong>Paladin</strong> - Unlocked through Gladiator</li><li><strong>Summoner</strong> - Unlocked through Arcanist</li><li><strong>Scholar</strong> - Unlocked through Arcanist</li><li><strong>Ninja</strong> - Unlocked through Rogue (Added in patch 2.4)</li></ul><p>Jobs are all linked to the class that they are obtained through. Meaning that when you are a level 50 Gladiator, you are also a level 50 Paladin. Changing roles is as simple as equipping the "Soul Crystal" for the job.</p><p>When playing as a job, you will have access to both the actions of base class as well as those of the job in question. You will also be able to equip certain actions belonging to other classes, though these are limited. Job-specific actions are acquired by completing job quests.</p><p>Arcanist is the only class that branches off into multiple jobs, although ultimately other classes will follow this trend.</p><p>Other classic Final Fantasy jobs being considered for implementation are more healing and magic based classes.</p><h2>Races</h2><p>Final Fantasy XIV has five playable races to choose from in character creation. The races will have very minor attribute differences, and these differences will not be as exaggerated as in Final Fantasy XI. In regards to gender, there are no attribute differences between male and female characters of the same race.</p><h3>Elezen</h3><p>The Elezen are nomadic people whose race used to lay total claim over the land of Eorzea and predated all the other races on</p><p>the lands of Eorzea.

The city is actually placed on many different islands or man-made formations known as sea stacks. Bridges span across each island in a kind of latticework pattern; a sight so beautiful, bards have named it "The Navigator's Veil." The goddess Llymlaen is said to have blessed Limsa Lominsa because she took pity on the sailors of a great armada that had to flee from battle. The rocks destroyed their ships and with no means to travel and no home to return to they settled in the islands using the remaining vessels that they had to begin construction. The people of Limsa Lominsa did not forget their old ways, but merely gathered strength to rebuild and adventure out again. Their influence soon</p><p>spread throughout the five seas of Eorzea.

A forest city-state located in Eorzea. A story in Eorzean history, "Tales of Bridges," describes Ishgard.</p><h2>Travel</h2><h3><a href="/">Aetheryte</a></h3><p>The <a href="/aetheryte/3055-3592/" data-ref-id="3055-3592">Aetheryte</a> is the name placed upon the large crystal shards found in the crystallized aetheric mist. They were precisely cut and fused to arcane machinery. These crystals are at the backbone of all everyday teleportation and are found throughout the realm, mainly in the individual city-states in which they are managed and operated. The origins and functions of these crystals is still very much a mystery. It is not known who constructed these crystals or what they were originally used for. Even though they are commonly used for teleportation, the actual process remains unknown. However, some have theorized that when a sentient presence approaches the crystal, it triggers the aether of the crystal and the body resonates with the crystal, breaking down into simple mass which then flows through the invisible aetheric streams of the planet. The person's soul is what actually guides the particles to the pre-determined destination and the crystal reconfigures the mist back into its original form. This is all instantaneous and this make easy travel to the far reaches of the world.</p><p>In the original release, teleportation through Aetheryte's was regulated through a concept called Anima. Your character would consume some of this for each teleport taken, and the greater the distance, the greater the Anima consumed. This was replenished at a very slow rate and limited its continuous use. This was abolished in the transition to A Realm Reborn, and now Gil is used for teleportation.</p><h3>Aethernet</h3><p>The Athernet is made up of smaller scale Aetheryte crystals inside a city. They are used for quick travel between locations inside the city. As with the larger Aetheryte crystals, you have attune yourself to an Aethernet crystal in order to be able to teleport to that crystal's location.</p><h3><a href="/chocobo/3015-259/" data-ref-id="3015-259">Chocobos</a></h3><p>One of the character mascots of the Final Fantasy series, Chocobos are available as player mounts within the word of Eorzea. You can either rent a chocobo within the three city-states for Gil, or you can get your own personal Chocobo. You must attain an enlisted rank within one of the three Grand Companies of Eorzea, and have 1,000 Grand Company seals in order to purchase a Chocobo Whistle, which can be used thereafter to call upon your own personal "horsebird". This is usually around character level 25ish.</p><p>There are several sets of Barding for your Chocobo available in the game. This changes the look of your Chocobo. There are 3 slots for Barding. (head, body, legs) They are available through reputation grinds (Grand Company), Veteran Rewards or maxing out the spec which is explained below.</p><p>When you have your Grand Company Chocobo, you can consume a "Gyshal Greens" item and your chocobo will fight alongside you as a companion. It is considered a party member. Therefore if you and a friend are in a party and each have your Chocobo out, you're unable to invite anyone else.</p><p>Once you get your Chocobo. You have 3 options you can "spec" it into. Tank, Healer or DPS. There are 20 Ranks (Levels). The EXP you earn from killing monsters is split with the Chocobo if you have it summoned. The Chocobo earns points at each rank which you can put into each "spec tree". If you put all points into a speicifc rank you earn a Barding set based on the spec. (Paladin barding for Tank, Dragoon Barding for Damage and White Mage barding for Healer)</p><h3>Other Mounts</h3><p>Along with chocobos, the game has a plethora of options available to players for mounts ranging from Magitek Armor, Goobbues, Fat Chocobos, Behemoths and more.</p><h2>Character Creation</h2><p>Making a character involves selecting one's race, physical appearance, and world server. Among the options for customizing are various face and hair styles, eye color adjustments, and characteristics such as battle scars, tattoos, bust size for females, muscle tone for males, voice type, etc. Each character must be equipped with a first and last name, the latter of which is mandatory.</p><h2>PC System Requirements</h2><p>The following are the PC specs required for Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn.</p><table><tbody><tr><td colspan="2"><strong>Minimum System Requirements</strong></td></tr><tr><td>OS</td><td>Windows® Vista 32/64bit, Windows® 7 32/64 bit</td></tr><tr><td>CPU</td><td>Intel® Core™2 Duo</td></tr><tr><td>Memory</td><td>2GB (4GB recommended for 64bit OS)</td></tr><tr><td>Available space on hard disk/SSD</td><td>20GB</td></tr><tr><td>Graphics Card</td><td>NVIDIA® Geforce® 8800 or higher, ATI Radeon™ HD 4770 or higher</td></tr><tr><td>Screen Resolution</td><td>1280x720</td></tr><tr><td>Internet</td><td>Persistent broadband internet connection required</td></tr><tr><td>Sound Card</td><td>DirectSound® compatible sound card (DirectX® 9.0c or higher)</td></tr><tr><td>DirectX®</td><td>DirectX® 9.0c or higher <em>(Direct X11 client available in Spring 2015)</em></td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><td colspan="2"><strong>Recommended System Requirements</strong></td></tr><tr><td>OS</td><td>Windows® 7 64 bit</td></tr><tr><td>CPU</td><td>Intel® Core™ i5</td></tr><tr><td>Memory</td><td>4GB</td></tr><tr><td>Available space on hard disk/SSD</td><td>20GB</td></tr><tr><td>Graphics Card</td><td>NVIDIA® Geforce® GTX 660 or higher, AMD Radeon™ HD 7950 or higher</td></tr><tr><td>Screen Resolution</td><td>1920x1080</td></tr><tr><td>Internet</td><td>Persistent broadband internet connection required</td></tr><tr><td>Sound Card</td><td>DirectSound® compatible sound card (DirectX® 9.0c or higher）</td></tr><tr><td>DirectX®</td><td>DirectX® 9.0c or higher</td></tr></tbody></table><p><em>* NVIDIA® SLI™ and AMD CrossFire™ support will be available at release.</em></p><h2>Subscription Information and Pricing</h2><p>Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn is a pay-to-play MMORPG, in much the same way as Final Fantasy XI and World of Warcraft.

      <deck><![CDATA[A reboot of the previously singleton franchise, this game features Faith using parkour in an open-world.]]></deck>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p>Mirror's Edge is a reboot of the first (and only prior) game in the Mirror's Edge franchise, again starring the runner, Faith, in her struggle against the oppressive government agents in a dystopian future. It has been described as an "open-world action adventure" built on <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/frostbite-3-0/3015-7847/" data-ref-id="3015-7847">Frostbite</a>.</p><h2>Rumors, Leaks, &amp; Reveal</h2><p>On July 12, 2009 a Mirror's Edge game was confirmed by President of <a href="/electronic-arts/3010-1/" data-ref-id="3010-1">EA</a> Games Europe Patrick Soderlund as being considered for development, saying</p><blockquote data-align="center" data-size="small"><p>"<em>You will see another Mirror's Edge for sure. It's just a matter of when that time is and what we do with it. We have a small team on it and I'm excited about what we do</em>...<em>Mirror's Edge was a risky move. It was a bold move, a very innovative and inspiring move. The game wasn't perfect by any means. We would have liked the game to sell better, even though the game has sold better than most people think</em>."</p></blockquote><p>In a February 2011 interview with Vicachu, Soderlund revealed that development work on Mirror's Edge 2 had stalled in favor of other projects, again citing the lack of Mirror's Edge sales as a disincentive for continuing work on the title.</p><p>On November 22 2012, <a href="/ben-cousins/3040-93517/" data-ref-id="3040-93517">Ben Cousins</a>, the former executive producer of the Battlefield series, mentioned on twitter in regards to DICE working only in the Battlefield games that: "It is general knowledge in the Stockholm dev scene that Mirror's Edge 2 is in production as DICE."</p><p>In May 2013, listings for the game briefly appeared on a few European Amazon websites, which were quickly removed. On May 30th, 2013, it was noticed that a help page for Mirror's Edge 2 existed on the EA website itself, but was promptly deleted later that same day.</p><h3>Announcement</h3><p>The game was officially announced on June 10th, 2013 at EA's <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/e3-2013/3015-7534/" data-ref-id="3015-7534">E3</a> Press Conference. Some gameplay was revealed of Faith fighting masked agents, intercut with her receiving a tattoo on her arm (a tattoo she already has in the original game, suggesting the game is a prequel). The game was announced for PC, Xbox One, and PS4, with no release date given, only that it will come "when it is ready."</p><p>On June 12, 2013, Patrick Söderlund explained in an interview that the game will be different compared to the first game. The original game received criticism on how it handled combat situations. Söderlund addressed this by saying: <em>"The first game was a lot about running away from things and, even though you want to have sections with that, you also want Faith... she's a powerful character and you want her to take control. You'll see a little bit more of that in this game.''</em> At the same time, he made sure to explain that the game will not become a shooter saying: <em>"Again, we're not going to turn this into a shooter. On the contrary, in fact. But we are going to evolve Faith and the story. Once we show more of this people will be genuinely excited. I am personally extremely excited about it."</em></p>]]></description>

"></a><figcaption>Lara's new character design reflects the game's nature as a full Tomb Raider reinvention. </figcaption></figure><p>Tomb Raider is an action-adventure game developed by <a href="/crystal-dynamics-inc/3010-959/" data-ref-id="3010-959">Crystal Dynamics</a>. It is a full reboot of the <a href="/tomb-raider/3025-267/" data-ref-id="3025-267">Tomb Raider</a> franchise; the game's story, written by <a href="/rhianna-pratchett/3040-42646/" data-ref-id="3040-42646">Rhianna Pratchett</a> and <a href="/susan-oconnor/3040-74356/" data-ref-id="3040-74356">Susan O'Connor,</a> tells the tale of a young and inexperienced Lara Croft's first adventure. The game was developed by 80% of the team that worked on previous Lara Croft games and features a brand new engine dubbed the Crystal Engine.</p><p>Tomb Raider's development was first announced by publisher <a href="/square-enix/3010-104/" data-ref-id="3010-104">Square Enix </a>on December 6, 2010. Initially scheduled for Fall 2012, release was pushed after Crystal Dynamics received a directive from Square Enix President <a href="/youichi-wada/3040-48566/" data-ref-id="3040-48566">Yoichi Wada </a>to make the best game that they could possibly make. It was finally released on March 5, 2013 to general acclaim.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Like its <a href="/tomb-raider/3025-267/" data-ref-id="3025-267">precursors</a>, the new Tomb Raider involves a mix of puzzle solving, platforming and combat in an open world environment. In terms of tone and mechanics, however, the game is more serious and realistic <b>– </b>Lara does not dive in slow motion while using dual pistols with pinpoint lock-on accuracy, but rather <a href="/cover-system/3015-55/" data-ref-id="3015-55">takes cover</a> behind the environment and eliminates enemies with a carefully aimed arrow from her bow. Unlike the typical franchise enemy roster, consisting largely of various wild animals, players' opponents in this game are almost universally human, with few exceptions. This decreased diversity is offset by an increased depth to the combat. Lara uses four different ranged weapons, each with its own unlockable upgrades, <a href="/alternate-fire/3015-593/" data-ref-id="3015-593">alt-fire mode</a>, and out-of-combat utility. Upgrading weapons requires resources in the form of salvage which can be found in various containers throughout the island or by looting corpses. She can also use salvage to unlock limited close-combat capabilities, being able to dodge and counterattack, as well as perform executions on incapacitated enemies.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-ref-id="1300-2458291" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/130213/2458291-2453624-203160_2013-03-10_00036.png" data-ratio="0.6062925170068" data-width="320" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 320px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:60.6%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/130213/2458291-2453624-203160_2013-03-10_00036.png" data-ref-id="1300-2458291"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/130213/2458291-2453624-203160_2013-03-10_00036.png" alt="Action-packed sequences abound."></a><figcaption>Action-packed sequences abound.</figcaption></figure><p>Tomb Raider's platforming follows in the vein of the <a href="/uncharted/3025-957/" data-ref-id="3025-957">Uncharted </a>series, with cinematic set-pieces and dynamic features, as well as limited use of <a href="/quick-time-event/3015-6/" data-ref-id="3015-6">quick-time events</a>. These set-pieces led to some initial negative publicity for the game (the first in the franchise to receive an 'M' ESRB rating), as failure frequently results in gruesome, fully-animated deaths, such as being impaled through the chin or crushed under a boulder. Increased control over jumps and the ability to scramble up walls, among other enhancements, make the platforming feel more polished mechanically than previously in the franchise. Puzzle-solving is also a more active process, as Lara must take into account variable elements such as fire, wind, and momentum. To aid her, Lara can activate her "<a href="/detective-mode/3015-6244/" data-ref-id="3015-6244">Survival Instinct</a>" at any time while standing still, which will highlight objectives, enemies, collectibles, and interactive elements.</p><p>Base Camps allow Lara to <a href="/fast-travel/3015-676/" data-ref-id="3015-676">fast travel</a> across the island. These camps are also where the player upgrades Lara's skills and weapons. Use of fast travel is essential for getting all the <a href="/collectibles/3015-375/" data-ref-id="3015-375">collectibles</a>, as many are hidden or blocked behind obstacles that Lara obtains the tools to overcome later in the game. These collectibles include journals from past island inhabitants and the Endurance crew, relics reflecting the island's legacy, and GPS markers which reveal hidden caches. They can be found through exploration, by use of Survival Instinct, or by clearing each area's tomb to retrieve the treasure map at the end.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align="left" data-size="medium" data-ref-id="1300-2603725" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/18/189230/2603725-2013-05-13_00006.jpg" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/18/189230/2603725-2013-05-13_00006.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2603725"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Don't look down." class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/18/189230/2603725-2013-05-13_00006.jpg"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/18/189230/2603725-2013-05-13_00006.jpg" alt="Don't look down."></noscript></a><figcaption>Don't look down.</figcaption></figure><p>Travelling aboard the <em>Endurance</em>, Lara and her boss, archaeologist <a href="/dr-james-jim-whitman/3005-25670/" data-ref-id="3005-25670">Dr. James Whitman</a>, are seeking the ruins of the legendary island of Yamatai, which was ruled by the shamanistic Sun Queen, Himiko. Accompanying Lara is the <em>Endurance</em>'s captain, Lara's mentor <a href="/conrad-roth/3005-25139/" data-ref-id="3005-25139">Conrad Roth</a>, as well as her friend of Japanese descent, Samantha, who is fascinated by the story of Himiko. For Lara, the quest is inherited from her father, also an archaeologist, while for Dr. Whitman the primary appeal is as material for a TV series. Against Dr. Whitman's wishes, they follow Lara's hunch that Yamatai is to be found in the Dragon's Triangle, an infamously stormy and dangerous area of the ocean southeast of Japan. The Endurance is caught in a raging squall and shipwrecked on a mysterious island. The survivors soon encounter a band of homicidal madmen, and are split up in the ensuing melee. Most of the game focuses on Lara's journeys across the island to reunite with and rescue her friends, and find a way home. Early on, she manages to send an SOS message, and a plane arrives to evacuate the survivors. However, a freak localized storm forms and strikes the plane from the sky</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="medium" data-ref-id="1300-2458801" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/130213/2458801-2453469-203160_2013-03-09_00011.png" data-ratio="0.64360587002096" data-width="480" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:64.4%" href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/130213/2458801-2453469-203160_2013-03-09_00011.png" data-ref-id="1300-2458801"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" alt="Trial by fire." class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/130213/2458801-2453469-203160_2013-03-09_00011.png"><noscript><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/130213/2458801-2453469-203160_2013-03-09_00011.png" alt="Trial by fire."></noscript></a><figcaption>Trial by fire.</figcaption></figure><p>As she fights the hostile inhabitants of Yamatai, it is revealed that they are a fanatical cult, led by the ruthless and insane <a href="/father-mathias/3005-25906/" data-ref-id="3005-25906">Father Mathias</a>, who was stranded there in 1982. As more people are shipwrecked by the Dragon Triangle's storms, the men are captured, tortured, and indoctrinated into the Solarii, the warrior core of the cult. The women, however, can be found crucified and burned to death across the island in some twisted ritual. Lara eventually reunites with most of her companions, including Joslin Reyes, the mechanic, who is repairing an escape boat, but discovers that Samantha has been abducted by Mathias for a sinister purpose. Pursuing him into the island's ancient temple, Lara discovers that the storms that surround Yamatai are caused by Himiko's vengeful spirit, still trapped in her ancient corpse. Mathias believes if they offer Himiko a "living successor", she'll stop the storms and allow them to escape. However, the ritual for the transferal of power involves a trial by fire, which every woman thus far has failed. Samantha miraculously survives the trial, and Mathias takes her into the inner sanctum to continue the ritual. This angers the Guardians, magically preserved but mindless soldiers of Yamatai who defend Himiko's remains. Lara fights her way through both Solarii and Guardians to finally reach Mathias and Samantha in the midst of the transference process. There, Lara finally learns the secret that Mathias knew but she didn't. Namely, that Himiko was a sorceress who cheated death by stealing the bodies of young women as she grew old again and again; the last 'successor to the throne' learned of this ahead of time and poisoned herself during the ritual, so that Himiko's evil soul was trapped in the girl's dead body. Mathias intends to sacrifice Sam to Himiko, giving Himiko the living Sam's body, killing Sam in the process. Therefore, to save her friend, Lara kills Mathias (finally wielding her trademark dual pistols) and torches Himiko's body, sending the witch-queen to Hell once and for all.</p><p>With the storms finally eliminated, Lara and Samantha escape with what few companions survive (only Reyes and Jonah, the galley master). They are picked up by a passing ship, and given the opportunity to go back home. However, traumatized by her experiences, Lara now believes that she is an adventurer at heart, and there are many more questions that need answering. She has become a survivor, and will go wherever she must to find answers.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p>Nioh, originally announced in October of 2004 as Oni, was originally planned to be released in 2006 alongside a feature film. The film's script was created by legendary Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, who died in September of 1998; the film was slated to be his son Hisao Kurosawa's directorial debut.
